0,2748,"the game is good 7/10TLDR: not everyone cup of tea, its a very hard puzzle plataformer. more appealing if you are into coding. enjoyed with walkthrough : https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=314249342i could list the points why its not better, but in the end it sumsup to one thing, learning curve, in the beginning its easy, then suddenly you need to look at algorithm, i have a small knowledge of coding, end had a hard time understanding, someone with zero knowledge? harder time. the game has an classic nes zelda vibe, so it has no tutorial, no map and no clear objective.its pretty cool how free you are to change the code, if you know how to do so.imagine battletoads difficulty, but you dont need skill, you need knowledge.i got up to level3, after that i played with an walkthroug, the level 5 is very confusing tho. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=314249342"
1,2748,"Years late review, but yeah this is half finished abandonwear"
2,2727,"You need to have some programming, debugging and reverse engineering knowledge (just the basics) to play the game.It was fun to play. I well spent evening."
3,2724,"What the hell happened here, Double Fine? Not to mention, why isn't it fixed yet, half-a decade later?!?1. Character may at times keep walking for a bit more, after you having let go of controls.2. Number 1. is severaly annyoing whenever it happens on a ledge or a bridge...causing certain death.2.5 See Number 1.2.75 See Number 1 AND Number 3.3. AFTER THAT HOWEVER, sometimes you will experiencie respawn repeatedly in  mid-air!!! In the same damn spot where you just fell to your death caused by Number 1 and Number 2...causing a chain of multiple, instant deaths..(4. AND random crash-to-desktop occurs often..!!!!!!)(3. and 4.. AND .X random crash-to-desktop occurs often..!!!!!!)This game is ABSOLUTELY NOT FINE , by any meaning of the word Fine .. :((Going by the developers apparent complete abandonment of bug-fixing:HACK n DASH would be more fitting title."
4,2722,"Loved playing this game! The mix of puzzles and programming are awesome! It starts simple, with only changing variables, true/false, numbers for health and times a rock can be pushed and text for a password. Later you get access to scripts where you can again edit some values and change some logical comparisons. Basic understanding of if statements and variables would help a lot, but I think anyone interested in logic puzzles would be able to enjoy this game.Multiple ways are available to get past some puzzles. Some resulting in skipped sequences.No editing of the game's files are required to play the game, but some scripts are editable, for those who feel like it, just make sure to back up your files, in case something breaks.Editing in game always let's you go ""back in time"" so if the world ends, you can go back to before the change was made."
5,2718,I liked it - but it was never finished.
6,2715,"This game is great for good enough programmers with some free time. For those, I definitely recommend it. The game provides multiple, amazing ways to solve many puzzles."
7,2659,"This game is, yes, finished. There is at least one area you get an error from after you've modified some (but not quite enough of the) code. Very few games give you what is essentially the source code for almost (if not all) of the game, editable inside the game itself.Quite an accomplishment, and still fun for programmers and others interested in playing around with code via somewhat odd methods of changing string constants and fiddling around with closures.I liked it, though I've been coding since the 80s. Lua script is quite popular for modding these days, and this will expose you to it, though not really ""train"" you how to code."
8,2653,clever game which is extremely fun for programmers and people who want to learn programming.
9,2649,"Game is really fun, but you can progress through many steps while missing things that are important later, then 3 hours later you realize you're stuck and you don't know why. (For me it was the lamp - that I could skip and pass the guard by hacking myself and giving myself speed and the language that was not decoded)"
10,2638,if you like puzzle games and programming then this is for you :3
11,2638,"Little to no, direction /explanation"
12,2636,"Really want to like this game but sadly I can't see myself recommending it. I think I enjoyed it partly because it was ""zelda-like"" and partly because I am a programmer. If that sounds like you and nothing in the cons is a deal-breaker, wait for a sale.Pros:- Decent animation/music/audio- simple controls that will remind you of early zelda games - early-game, it can be fun to wander around the world, ""hacking"" enemies/rocks/etc and solving puzzles- liked the concept and at least the early game implementationCons:- lot of late game crashes, especially in the ""algorithms"" that appear in the tower. I think a large part of this is because they draw animated connecting lines from the input on the left to the associated pieces on the right.- pretty much all of the late game stuff everything in the tower would be way too complicated for non-programmers. Even some programmers might have trouble with them without spending considerable time  to read through very long functions. I haven't worked with lua at all which the game references so i am not sure if the code snippets in game are spot-on lua or a gamified version but it didn't resemble javascript/java/c/c++/c#/python/bash very much except maybe in terms of IF statements. - when you get to the parts that are more programming-like (functions and such), it doesn't do that great of a job of making it into an experience of ""learn programming by playing a game""... so no value if you were hoping to teach kids programming this way... unless you're a sadist. they might get a good idea of state-based flags that can be memory changed and IF statements. Game technically touches on Loops but it is fairly late game and IMHO done poorly so that non-programmers would probably struggle with the concept (e.g. you might get a hidden dialog box commenting on it but it is out-of-the-way and easy to miss, even then doesn't really do a good job explaining). Doesn't really touch on types much besides boolean and integer and some string.- i thought the ending and ""explanation"" was kinda half-baked. not terrible (def seen worse) but still enough for me to list it as a con."
13,2635,"Fun game. Starts off simple, just increasing or decreasing variables (like health). Later on in the game it gets more interesting and requires a bit of thinking. Overall it was short, but fun."
14,2633,"Okay so let me just say that the idea behind this is novel and very interesting. With that said, it suffers from the same thing a lot of DoubleFine games do: It takes a great idea and doesn't execute on it properly to form a game that makes sense in design and feels complete in story.The basic gist of the game is that you start out altering small variables in the code of enemies and objects, then by the end you're altering larger parts of code pieces which are the actual LUA code of the areas and enemies.The problem with that is that as soon as the more complex powers open up, it becomes extremely easy to break something and there isn't even a ""reset"" button in the objects you use to get back to default code. So you can very easily get yourself into a situation where the game is going through it's ""crash"" sequence and you have no idea why. On top of that, they throw a TON of code pieces at you and it's very rarely clear which you need to alter. I'm sure there are many ways through a situation but there are far too many useless code snippets to look through to find the solution to any one problem.Aside from that, the basic design of the map and levels is rough. It is very hard to remember the way to navigate to different areas and there is no map you can pull up. There are areas where you can't get past until far later in the game but they don't explicitly tell you that so you should expect to waste a ton of time in these areas, thinking you're on the cusp of figuring out how to use the items you have to get past.On top of that, there is very little direction in this game. It's near-impossible to tell where the ""next"" place to go is, and even sometimes it's not clear whether you're done with the area you're in or not. Even the most beginner course in game design will teach someone how to get around these problems, but DoubleFine just seemed to ignore them and release the game as-is.I had fun, and I really liked what they were TRYING to pull off here, but I absolutely can't recommend it with all of it's faults."
15,2631,"This was one of the first games I bought but I hate it ever since. It was way before the refund system, so I couldn't get a refund."
16,2625,"I tried to give it a chance. I went against all the reviews, I kept going when the game was acting wonky, and oh boy did it act wonky half the time. Don't buy it. Even on sale, not worth your time, not worth the effort, not worth the pain. I'm a programmer so I cant tell how accessible it is to non programmers.This game lets you edit anything(not really cuz possible ways to change stuff are limited so it usually crashes the game) at some point and the problem with that is you have no idea if your solution was even meant to be or if you didnt hack into the game's code a little bit too hard."
17,2622,I did not enjoy this game
18,2619,Fun. Wish there were more like it.

24,2610,"Overall it's a very fun and a story that kept my interest. the only negative of this game is that some of the later-on puzzles are extremely complicated and often required me to look up a walkthrough, and the story also felt a little bit unfinished or even somewhat short(?). but the game has such a unique style of gameplay and the story has good enough material that it's worth the price."

40,2604,"Great game, although it can be really frustrating sometimes... and by sometimes i mean a lot of times, because a lot of times you're just literally just guessing about what to do.  It really helps to have programming experience beforehand... and even then, it can still be really frustrating.  If you go into this game without any knowledge of programming... well, good luck with that... And there are several times when you can literally end up freezing your game because you edited the wrong thing (freezing the game in a way that the game itself cannot recover from without you doing Alt+F4).But yeah, if you enjoy a really meta-style, puzzle-ish, semi-programming-ish game, this game is for you."

64,2587,"I hate to say it, I can't recommend this game.  The premise is solid and the idea amusing but it's not there otherwise.  I made it as far as the dungeon where you acquire the script kitty.  I needed some walkthrough help earlier, a bad sign since it means that puzzles are being vague or nonsensical.  From there, I needed more help until I finally entered a chamber with a large variety of scripts that needed editing to simply pass the room and I was done.  I looked over the rest of the walkthrough and it looks like it only continues to get worse from here.  The mechanics aren't well explained or intuative, it isn't trying to teach you code, it's trying to test if you can already code.  It quickly becomes a chore instead of a game, and that's where the novelty of the mechanics wears off entirely and it's just not amusing after that."

(possible minor spoilers in this review)DDLC but far less creepy (you'll only understand if you've played DDLC)adventure, but you can break the rules (and are expected to)Many different solutions to almost every puzzle.Actually a good introduction to hacking.Hack 'n Slash is a game where you learn to hack the game in order to proceed.  Those of you that have played the Amnesia Fortnight prototype, don't worry, its a (almost) completely different story, with no (huge) spoilers.  Both this game and the prototype in 2012 are standalone games in their own right, no connection between them storywise.For everyone else, get ready for a hacking fun time!Graphics are all just 2D art.  Music sounds original, and fits well with the theme.  Gameplay is a mix of hacking and zelda-like gameplay.Puzzles.  Programming gurus will have no problems at all with all but one puzzle.  Programming newbies have the option of learning about most of the basic building blocks, and may only get stuck once or twice.  I personally enjoyed the difficulty, even if it was (MOSTLY) on the easy side.  That final chapter has a few doozies of a puzzle, though.Replayability:  There is almost infinite replayability.  Quite a few secrets in the game, every puzzle has multiple solutions, there is no wrong way to solve a puzzle.  Some paths will only lead to frustration, however, as you have a LOT of power to completely break the game near the end.Thoughts:  I love games that only take themselves partially seriously, and this is one of those games.  With enough know-how, you will never run out of hearts, and are basically unbeatable, causing you to understand the main antagonist.  However, with great power comes great responsibility.  Once you get far enough, the game basically gives you the source for everything and lets you do as you wish to it.  You can change cutscenes, you can change what is said, you can look at rooms ahead in preparation, and learn the solution without ever setting foot in the room.There are only two places where I felt you can truly get stuck, and the only option be force quitting the game and starting again, and one place after a certain event where you will scratch your head as to why the game crashed, only to remember  a few moments later exactly why.But, even with all the issues (every so often you'll do something and get a crash that upon reloading the area the crash doesn't happen), the game does give that sense of wonder that most of us remember from the first time we ever hacked a game or used game genie to hack lives, levels, hearts, etc.I recommend this game to those that want some of that nostalgia back.  It doesn't feel like cheating when hacking is quite literally the only way to continue.  Lots of small secrets, a few throwbacks, and with mods you can likely fix all issues you find while playing, so there's no excuse to be lazy!The only thing I dislike about this is that Double Fine doesn't seem to be taking it more seriously. :("

You can change cutscenes, you can change what is said, you can look at rooms ahead in preparation, and learn the solution without ever setting foot in the room.There are only two places where I felt you can truly get stuck, and the only option be force quitting the game and starting again, and one place after a certain event where you will scratch your head as to why the game crashed, only to remember  a few moments later exactly why.But, even with all the issues (every so often you'll do something and get a crash that upon reloading the area the crash doesn't happen), the game does give that sense of wonder that most of us remember from the first time we ever hacked a game or used game genie to hack lives, levels, hearts, etc.I recommend this game to those that want some of that nostalgia back.  It doesn't feel like cheating when hacking is quite literally the only way to continue.  Lots of small secrets, a few throwbacks, and with mods you can likely fix all issues you find while playing, so there's no excuse to be lazy!The only thing I dislike about this is that Double Fine doesn't seem to be taking it more seriously. :("
71,2583,"I LOVE THIS GAME! (possible minor spoilers in this review)DDLC but far less creepy (you'll only understand if you've played DDLC)adventure, but you can break the rules (and are expected to)Many different solutions to almost every puzzle.Actually a good introduction to hacking.Hack 'n Slash is a game where you learn to hack the game in order to proceed.  Those of you that have played the Amnesia Fortnight prototype, don't worry, its a (almost) completely different story, with no (huge) spoilers.  Both this game and the prototype in 2012 are standalone games in their own right, no connection between them storywise.For everyone else, get ready for a hacking fun time!Graphics are all just 2D art.  Music sounds original, and fits well with the theme.  Gameplay is a mix of hacking and zelda-like gameplay.Puzzles.  Programming gurus will have no problems at all with all but one puzzle.  Programming newbies have the option of learning about most of the basic building blocks, and may only get stuck once or twice.  I personally enjoyed the difficulty, even if it was (MOSTLY) on the easy side.  That final chapter has a few doozies of a puzzle, though.Replayability:  There is almost infinite replayability.  Quite a few secrets in the game, every puzzle has multiple solutions, there is no wrong way to solve a puzzle.  Some paths will only lead to frustration, however, as you have a LOT of power to completely break the game near the end.Thoughts:  I love games that only take themselves partially seriously, and this is one of those games.  With enough know-how, you will never run out of hearts, and are basically unbeatable, causing you to understand the main antagonist.  However, with great power comes great responsibility.

84,2577,"Terrible ""game"". The concept sounds fun on paper, but the execution is terrible. There's very little to the gameplay - hit things with your USB sword and a property window appears. Change a value to what you want - e.g. give an enemy 0 health - and close the property window. It is extremely tedious, made much worse by the fact that all enemies respawn when you change screens.The free-roam map is dull - large open sections with almost nothing to do. There's no guidance on where to go. The story is paper thin and not engaging at all."

92,2565,"Lots of rough spots but overall quite fun if you like to tinker. Mechanics escalate and mesh very well with story, the puzzles are pretty fun. A few parts were frustrating where a solution that should have been correct weren't (e.g. for me: magic gate), . I was satisfied with neutering the final boss by ending it when it was supposed to start :P. By the end you can tinker with the game permanently which can get it pretty broke (but you can turn back time)"
