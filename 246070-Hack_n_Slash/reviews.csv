It starts simple, with only changing variables, true/false, numbers for health and times a rock can be pushed and text for a password. Later you get access to scripts where you can again edit some values and change some logical comparisons. Basic understanding of if statements and variables would help a lot, but I think anyone interested in logic puzzles would be able to enjoy this game.Multiple ways are available to get past some puzzles. Some resulting in skipped sequences.No editing of the game's files are required to play the game, but some scripts are editable, for those who feel like it, just make sure to back up your files, in case something breaks.Editing in game always let's you go ""back in time"" so if the world ends, you can go back to before the change was made."

246070,10,0,zpangwin,744,11,-1,21.8,"July 12, 2020","Really want to like this game but sadly I can't see myself recommending it. I think I enjoyed it partly because it was ""zelda-like"" and partly because I am a programmer. If that sounds like you and nothing in the cons is a deal-breaker, wait for a sale.Pros:- Decent animation/music/audio- simple controls that will remind you of early zelda games - early-game, it can be fun to wander around the world, ""hacking"" enemies/rocks/etc and solving puzzles- liked the concept and at least the early game implementationCons:- lot of late game crashes, especially in the ""algorithms"" that appear in the tower. I think a large part of this is because they draw animated connecting lines from the input on the left to the associated pieces on the right.- pretty much all of the late game stuff everything in the tower would be way too complicated for non-programmers. Even some programmers might have trouble with them without spending considerable time  to read through very long functions. I haven't worked with lua at all which the game references so i am not sure if the code snippets in game are spot-on lua or a gamified version but it didn't resemble javascript/java/c/c++/c#/python/bash very much except maybe in terms of IF statements. - when you get to the parts that are more programming-like (functions and such), it doesn't do that great of a job of making it into an experience of ""learn programming by playing a game""... so no value if you were hoping to teach kids programming this way... unless you're a sadist. they might get a good idea of state-based flags that can be memory changed and IF statements. Game technically touches on Loops but it is fairly late game and IMHO done poorly so that non-programmers would probably struggle with the concept (e.g. you might get a hidden dialog box commenting on it but it is out-of-the-way and easy to miss, even then doesn't really do a good job explaining). Doesn't really touch on types much besides boolean and integer and some string.- i thought the ending and ""explanation"" was kinda half-baked. not terrible (def seen worse) but still enough for me to list it as a con."

246070,5,0,Korberos,865,100,-1,5.0,"June 23, 2020","Okay so let me just say that the idea behind this is novel and very interesting. With that said, it suffers from the same thing a lot of DoubleFine games do: It takes a great idea and doesn't execute on it properly to form a game that makes sense in design and feels complete in story.The basic gist of the game is that you start out altering small variables in the code of enemies and objects, then by the end you're altering larger parts of code pieces which are the actual LUA code of the areas and enemies.The problem with that is that as soon as the more complex powers open up, it becomes extremely easy to break something and there isn't even a ""reset"" button in the objects you use to get back to default code. So you can very easily get yourself into a situation where the game is going through it's ""crash"" sequence and you have no idea why. On top of that, they throw a TON of code pieces at you and it's very rarely clear which you need to alter. I'm sure there are many ways through a situation but there are far too many useless code snippets to look through to find the solution to any one problem.Aside from that, the basic design of the map and levels is rough. It is very hard to remember the way to navigate to different areas and there is no map you can pull up. There are areas where you can't get past until far later in the game but they don't explicitly tell you that so you should expect to waste a ton of time in these areas, thinking you're on the cusp of figuring out how to use the items you have to get past.On top of that, there is very little direction in this game. It's near-impossible to tell where the ""next"" place to go is, and even sometimes it's not clear whether you're done with the area you're in or not. Even the most beginner course in game design will teach someone how to get around these problems, but DoubleFine just seemed to ignore them and release the game as-is.I had fun, and I really liked what they were TRYING to pull off here, but I absolutely can't recommend it with all of it's faults."

The mechanics aren't well explained or intuative, it isn't trying to teach you code, it's trying to test if you can already code.

(possible minor spoilers in this review)DDLC but far less creepy (you'll only understand if you've played DDLC)adventure, but you can break the rules (and are expected to)Many different solutions to almost every puzzle.Actually a good introduction to hacking.Hack 'n Slash is a game where you learn to hack the game in order to proceed.  Those of you that have played the Amnesia Fortnight prototype, don't worry, its a (almost) completely different story, with no (huge) spoilers.  Both this game and the prototype in 2012 are standalone games in their own right, no connection between them storywise.For everyone else, get ready for a hacking fun time!Graphics are all just 2D art.  Music sounds original, and fits well with the theme.  Gameplay is a mix of hacking and zelda-like gameplay.Puzzles.  Programming gurus will have no problems at all with all but one puzzle.  Programming newbies have the option of learning about most of the basic building blocks, and may only get stuck once or twice.  I personally enjoyed the difficulty, even if it was (MOSTLY) on the easy side.  That final chapter has a few doozies of a puzzle, though.Replayability:  There is almost infinite replayability.  Quite a few secrets in the game, every puzzle has multiple solutions, there is no wrong way to solve a puzzle.  Some paths will only lead to frustration, however, as you have a LOT of power to completely break the game near the end.Thoughts:  I love games that only take themselves partially seriously, and this is one of those games.  With enough know-how, you will never run out of hearts, and are basically unbeatable, causing you to understand the main antagonist.  However, with great power comes great responsibility.  Once you get far enough, the game basically gives you the source for everything and lets you do as you wish to it.  You can change cutscenes, you can change what is said, you can look at rooms ahead in preparation, and learn the solution without ever setting foot in the room.There are only two places where I felt you can truly get stuck, and the only option be force quitting the game and starting again, and one place after a certain event where you will scratch your head as to why the game crashed, only to remember  a few moments later exactly why.But, even with all the issues (every so often you'll do something and get a crash that upon reloading the area the crash doesn't happen), the game does give that sense of wonder that most of us remember from the first time we ever hacked a game or used game genie to hack lives, levels, hearts, etc.I recommend this game to those that want some of that nostalgia back.
