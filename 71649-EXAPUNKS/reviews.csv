716490,44,0,jennblaze,165,6,1,37.4,"December 8, 2018","For the longest time, I wanted to love Zachtronics games, because I love logic games, but each of them had little flaws for me. Some were too hard, and some were too easy. Some of them required me think really spatially in a way that I found annoying. Others had artificial limitations that made me upset because I just wanted to finish the level and get my teeth into a new puzzle.Exapunks has none of those problems for me. It's the perfect puzzle game: hard, but not so hard that I get frustrated and it's not fun anymore. Some of the later levels are extremely challenging, but a little perseverance and patience wins in the end. I enjoyed each of them, and none of them were so gimmicky or challenging that I was glad to be done with them and move on. Instead, I enjoyed them and felt accomplished.I've completed the main story levels, but I suspect that there's a lot more playability out there to optimize and get better rankings. I wouldn't take my timing (15.8 hours) as a good manifestation of how long it takes on average to complete the main campaign. I didn't spend any time playing the mini games or reprogramming the game it gives you, and I have a background in coding, so this game was a bit easier for me to pick up than it might be for other people. I could probably easily dump 40 more hours into the game to get my solutions more optimized for speed or size.As far as the logic goes, I'm really impressed by the ingenuity of the programing language in this game. It’s really a lot like some of the languages I’ve had to use throughout the years, and it’s general enough that you can use some of the tactics you’d have to use in real life coding without getting bogged down with weird semantics and rules. It’s really easy to pick up and memorize, even if you have little to no background in programming.Speaking of memorization, you don’t actually have to do so, because the game comes with nifty documentation that gives you a cheat sheet of all the commands in the form of “zines.” I really loved the ‘90s cyberpunk vibe that even the documentation committed to. I never thought a puzzle game with coding elements could be really atmospheric, but this one actually is. The characters and AI are really interesting, as is the story. I like how the game draws you into the story and makes the characters believable and unique, yet it all still has recognizable archetypes of the cyberpunk genre for those who like that sort of thing.If you enjoy logic puzzles, I think you’d like this game, even if you’ve never played Zachtronics games before or had any background in programming!"

Играется более расслабленно чем предыдущие, за счёт того, что модули кода (здесь экзы, но по сути это самоходные блоки из TIS-100) НЕ ограничены по размеру; то есть твоё решение может быть сколь угодно громоздким.На самом деле, по памяти ограничений тоже нет. И по времени. Но, несмотря на это, игра не становится лёгкой - она становится ""проходимой"". Единственным ограничением на решение является твоё собственное воображение. Примерно как в Prime Mover-е, хотя он сложнее.Вообще, удобство программирования это пол-дела. Помимо этого здесь создан ""живой"" визуально-новелльный мир - наверное, самый живой из всех игр Zachtronics, за исключением, возможно, Infinifactory.

I enjoyed the programming a lot, it's my jam, and there's something comforting in the puzzle experience knowing that I can solve any problem presented within a level. However, the thing kept bringing me back to play one more level or to solve a puzzle I was having trouble with were the kinetic novel scenes (not sure if this is the correct term, but I'll roll with it). I like the 90's hacker fantasy, and appreciate what this game evokes of that experience, because writing the programs helped me feel much closer to the narrative experience than TIS-100. For me, that I was able to identify with and inhabit the main character Moss made me excited for future Zachtronics titles and to see how narrative and mechanics work together to create an experience similar to what I've heard people say about the game Hades.So many other reviews have talked about the programming aspects of this game, so I don't feel the need to cover that in detail, because they have done a better job than I will.

It seems like there's a lot of optimization you could do at first glance, but the puzzles are so simple you'll never make a bad solution that really needs optimizing. Even getting to the solution never really requires any serious thought. It's possible that I'm really early into the game and it gets harder later, but I doubt it.From a story perspective I'm not even sure you'd call what you do in this game hacking. No one in this universe has any authentication on their servers, meaning you're essentially coding straight into the target network from your home computer, and this is untraceable somehow. It's a very special type of dystopia when anyone can just plug into a bank's network and make all of their ATMs start spitting out all their money.What this game is really missing is an exploration element. Scouring the web for the addresses of servers, exploring said servers without being caught by the defenses, and so on seems like what they were going for here.

Actually finished it now (with some help from reddit for the last puzzle admittedly), but feelsgoodman.If you're interested in trying out a Zachtronics game, I'd definitely recommend this one, since it has a cool Story/flavour around it unlike the other ones I tried (T-100 and Shenzen).

Not only is it a lot of fun, it will teach you useful real-world programming concepts.EXAPUNKS is my favorite Zachtronics game so far. Out of the 3 assembly-based ones - TIS-100, Shenzen I/O, and this - I suggest getting this one first. It's the easiest and most forgiving of all of them, and has the widest variety in its levels. Unlike the gimmicky levels in Shenzhen, the story behind each level in EXAPUNKS actually informs the level's design in interesting and unique ways.Just getting through the levels in EXAPUNKS is a breeze. Unlike in TIS and Shenzhen, you have a large and flexible instruction set to work with, RAM in the form of files, two fully general-purpose registers, as many EXAs as you need, and no limits on instruction counts (except if you want to get on the leaderboards).The real fun, as usual, is in optimization. And boy, is this game satisfying to optimize. Because of the relatively lax restrictions on instruction and EXA counts, there are huge opportunities for loop unrolling, clever timing tricks, and parallelism limited only by fundamental bandwidth limits and your ability to conduct your army of EXAs in an intricate dance. Optimizing these solutions feels like real engineering, moreso than in other Zachtronics games. Certainly it's the most familiar to me as a programmer.The complementary solitaire is a nice addition as usual, and the other minigame seems nice although it's not my type of game. However, the hacker battles feel like maybe they should've been scrapped. They just don't really work how I think they were meant to - it's too easy to cheese a solution to any single person's AI in particular, and I think there's a reason pretty much nobody bothered coming back to these. Maybe if the game made you submit the same AI against all available opponents, instead of being able to cheese each one individually, it would have been a fun part of the game. Oh well, there's more than enough of the normal levels to go around."

If you don't know what I'm talking about, make sure you know what you're getting into -- this is a game that involves actual programming.A couple of big new ideas here: Your EXAs, unlike microcontrollers in Shenzhen or CPUs in TIS-100, can move between hosts, and they can replicate, and there's some file manipulation. That all feels appropriate for a game themed around hacking.A more esoteric bit: Custom puzzles are scripted in JavaScript, instead of Lua, and it seems to be a reasonably modern JS. They're more powerful, too -- in Shenzhen, your Lua script had to output a static test case; here, your script can dynamically interact with the player's solution.I learned my lesson from Opus Magnum, and I have no desire to 100% the achievements -- maybe I'll eventually finish all the Solitaire games, but the hacker competitions and the twitch match/3 games both feel out of place and are not things I want to spend days trying to get a higher score in.

The game itself is set in a 90's retro-futuristic cyberpunk environment where you are a retired hacker afflicted with a terminal illness, the treatment for which is trapped behind an insurmountable paywall in typical dystopian fashion. Under the stress of these conditions you are forced to come back out of retirement and re-learn your trade. The story is told through short, somewhat static, dialogue scenes. You can easily skip these if you really don't care. The core of the gameplay is in the coding puzzles, tasks you must complete to earn money for your treatment. I have not completed the storyline yet but it is very linear so far though still interesting. This game is actually a very cleverly disguised code training module. At no point during my play-through did it actually feel like work; if you have experience working in assembly then you probably understand that this is an outstanding achievement. The language used by this game is actually very similar to ARM cortex assembly languages in execution. If you have prior programming experience in higher level languages, this game provides an interesting perspective for working only a few levels above machine op-codes. There are no for or while loops and you must manage your limited number of registers carefully. Each puzzle can be solved in multiple ways, and the game grades your solution on the conditions of how many clock cycles used, the length of your code is, and the number of link actions used.If you are planning on taking an EE course in microprocessors in the near future I highly recommend playing through this game beforehand, I wish I had known about it! It will be much more helpful than that chegg subscription you were probably considering. Almost everything about the gameplay is a direct analogue to the coding portions of that type of class all the way down to the presentation of the puzzle goals and reading the included documentation to learn the syntax, just much more fun with an interesting aesthetic and a light story. I will definitely be checking out the other games from Zachtronics after I finish this one."

The language used is well documented, the art fits the cheesy early hacker aesthetic to a t, and the story is engaging enough to make you want to bang your head on your desk figuring out the next solution. In the cons column, if you aren't a fan of reading the manual this is not a game for you. Reading the documentation is necessary, and referencing it regularly will be the only way to figure out some solutions.

It's hard to quantify which one was my favorite, I really love all three of these games. In terms of difficulty, I'm inclined to say that opus magnum < exapunks < infinifactory, although that might just be because I played infinifactory first and was pretty inexperienced with this type of game at the time. Infinifactory took me 65ish hours to 100%, opus magnum took 20ish to beat the main story, exapunks took 25 to beat the main story.I write all this in case anyone else has played some other zachtronics games and are wondering where I think this one lies. The puzzles in this game are coding puzzles, which is intimidating for someone like me who has never coded anything in their life. However, nearly all the instructions are laid out very well in the documents you receive at the start of the game. I was able to comfortably complete every level in the main story aside from one (where I didn't know how the swizzle command worked), and only three were above the soft instruction limit.To anyone who knows they like zachtronics games or just challenging puzzles in general, this game is absolutely worth playing.

The thing here is basically working with great constraints, e.g. you barely get variables to work with, and yet to pack a small code. It feels like a mixture of syntax and automata design and it is very fun.When you complete the task you will see the leaderboards displaying other people's stats regarding lines of code, cycles used, etc, in their solutions. So the puzzles are manifold challenges.For non-programmers, I think it IS possible to do this as well. I'm just some random CPP noob, and I'm having some difficulty but moving forward. I'd say TRY it, because this is so different to other games, it is really an amazing genre on its own. I never played anything like this before. You might end up loving to code stuff.Some minor things to comment: (a) I like the main menu display music, but the puzzles have distracting music (and stock volume is so LOUD), I turn off music altogether (maybe we could keep the same generic music all along or choose between soundtracks). (b) There SHOULD be a way to consult the zine inside the game, like a pop up, because minimazing the app to read the pdf is a bit annoying. (c) The atmosphere is really 90s, but the story-telling can be a bit silly (tho since I'm at the 10th puzzle, I'm not sure if all that info plays some role further down the game.) (d) Why I can't apply any options, like windowed game?? This would help with the music and zine issues.Finally, a suggestion would be to make a mod where players can build puzzles and challenge the community. That's a perfect game to do something like this.Conclusion: Highly satisfied, 9/10."

Adopts a more in-depth, code-level approach to the process problem solving found in games like SpaceChem. Also serves as a great introduction to assembly language programming. Can be frustrating due to increasingly complex puzzles, steep learning curve, locked-linear mission list, and thin documentation. Funky cyberpunk soundtrack is on point.

But the way dystopian films of the '80s thought it would be, not the acutal 1997 when mighty boybands roamed the Earth and cell phones still weighed a pound. You're dumped into this land of cyberpunk misery, given a vaguely-named terminal disease (The Phage), and you get your chance to prove your cyberpunk fantasies by being the unstoppable cyberguru you know you could be. Except for one thing: you can't.Earn Your GreatnessWell, not at first, anyway. This is a game with a steep learning curve because you're actually learning assembly programming. Really! EXAPUNKS is a game where you create and program little digital agents (EXAs) using actual assembly language programming. Each mission in the game tasks you with completing certain objectives. To do so, you need to code processes into EXAs to perform a variety of functions - manipulating and moving data, affecting systems, even full-on EXA-to-EXA combat (sorta). The catch is that you're not some Hollywood programmer; you need to write code here.Where games like SpaceChem have you graphically map out what your processes do, EXAPUNKS approaches the concept from the other direction, forgoing visuals for code. This could make the game less friendly and approachable. Watching code run really doesn't do it for many people, because it's, well, dull. It's also sometimes difficult to envision what's actually happening. So, Zachtronics added a graphical representation of everything that goes on, letting you watch a visual version of your code working in its environment and making the game much more approachable, but no less difficult.The Learning CliffEXAPUNKS is, much like 688(I) Hunter/Killer, a game that has a lot for players to learn and is not a fan of hand-holding. EXAPUNKS starts you out slow enough with simple, basic tasks, then works you up to more complex work. The game doesn't really hold you back, allowing you to apply complex concepts as soon as you're comfortable with them (and know them), so you can apply the full power of your coding creativity. However, you need to learn what to do, because this ain't Hollywood, and EXAs don't speak a human language. The game teaches you your coding through in-universe documentation in the form of a series of short magazines. These introduce you to coding vocabulary, operation, and concepts, as well as to more game-specific concepts that will be necessary to complete missions. Mostly. The documentation is pretty bare-bones, so you will need to apply a lot of creative problem solving and experimentation in order to succeed and, in some cases, you're going to be resorting to trial-and-error to figure out just how to make something work. This is a game for patient, detail-oriented gamers. Immediate-gratification, easily frustrated players will probably find EXAPUNKs rage-inducing or just plain boring. A Teaching Game?If a lot of that sounds like going to school, there's a reason for that: in many ways, EXAPUNKS is a reasonably good primer on assembly programming wrapped up in the attractive packaging of a game. While you won't be able to take what you learn for the game and immediately go apply for a programming job, it nevertheless teaches the basics and gets you started on understanding concepts like code recursion and adaptable programming. In some ways, it's arguably better than some modern classes on the subject as EXAs are severely limited, and you have to shepherd your resources carefully. Unlike modern programming principles which view memory and processing as effectively infinite, you're tightly constrained and need to develop smart, efficient solutions to succeed. That makes this an effective tool for keeping programming skills sharp as well as one for getting people interested in coding a taste of it.The Bottom LineEXPUNKS is an outstanding programming game. Varied missions keep things interesting, and minimal restrictions on tool usagecombined with multiple paths to solve any given problem make it an outstanding problem-solving programming puzzler. Along the way, players will learn efficient programming practices and techniques (mainly because if you don't, you won't get far), and enjoy that real surge of satisfaction of conquering complex problems. However, players need to be willing to put in the effort to learn how to use the tools at their disposal beacuse there's no hand-holding in this game, and patience is key. But for those detail-oriented, technical gamers, EXAPUNKS is a love letter through and through. For those gamers, this is a strongly recommended title that earns an A with ease."

This makes it lose some of the fantastic simplicity of nature that Human Resource Machine has, but that... doesn't really matter.Exapunks also heavily limits your memory. In HRM you can store a couple of values while inn Exapunks you can only save 1, sometimes 2 if you find a way to bypass conditional statements. Exapunks also features a wonderful feel, it has lore and a ""chat"" window, which reacts to you completing levels (which is in predetermined order so yeah well it's more lore) and which is written in very colloquial talk. Overall, the game has many elements contributing to the feel, like the Zine, which one is theoretically supposed to print... but you don't have to. Probably more convenient to do so though.

716490,1,0,Metaflame,89,6,1,73.5,"December 7, 2019","If you've played SHENZEN-IO, this game is very similar, but less restrictive with instructions and space. Each EXA can move around networks all it wants and hold many more instructions (with a very high upper limit that you usually won't even hit). Nonetheless, it's still fun and challenging, you just aren't gonna get stuck on levels as much.Gameplay: Basically, programming in assembly. You have EXAs (EXecution Agents) at your disposal, each can occupy one space in a grid-shaped network (one square represents one memory space). The EXAs can move themselves between networks using links, interact with existing files (or make new ones), or send each other messages. Unlike SHENZEN-IO, EXAs don't have to ""sleep"" to resynchronize and everything is just based on cycles (1 instruction per cycle). One big improvement is the ability to test a specific test run for debuging (each test run is different and there's 100 of them).Besides the main story itself, much like in SHENZEN-IO, you can try building games for a console, which lets you read D-Pad and X, Y, Z button inputs, and display monochromatic pixelated sprites. There's also a ""3D"" mode as they call it, though I haven't tried that out yet. And, as usual, you can create your own levels (with some Javascript knowledge).Story-wise, the game is really immersive and feels like it has an entire world of its own. You get to read a magazine (or just 'zine), which basically functions the same way reference manuals in SHENZEN-IO did (except in a more reader-friendly magazine-like way). And whenever you hack something, you can usually see the effects it had on others, either through the narrative, or through messages from other people in a group chat you're in (you can't interact with it though). For example, hacking a snack company to change the recipe of a product made other chat members a bit weirded out by the (seemingly) company's mistake. And trust me, it made me feel really bad when I had to hack an online game to reset ownership of all buildings and upgrades, and I saw the reactions in the group chat. And no one ever finds out it was you."

Whenever I get one I immediately check if there are any sort of manuals in the installation folder. Which reminds me of the days when I first started programming: the internet wasn't as common in households yet and typically slow. When you found a programming book it usually had a guide, tutorials and a language reference if it was nice quality. Whenever you had issues it was common to talk to other programmers over internet relay chat, go over the language reference again seeing if you missed something or bug one of your family & friends if they had similar interests. The developer commonly captures all these feelings in each game. This one captured it particularly well and is fun to play around with without being too restrictive. You don't need experience in coding to enjoy the game, but by playing it you will become comfortable with the bread and butter concepts of any good programming language. This is my favorite of the developer's games so far, but this may change as I haven't beat each and every game yet. I support this developer through multiple gaming platforms because I support the quality of their work and hope for future releases.

716490,11,0,ckoe01,292,6,1,52.0,"September 21, 2019","Having played SpaceChem and OpusMagnum, this is my favorite Zachtronics game so far. In my opinion, SpaceChem has some very strict restrictions which turn some assignments into the the trial and error problem of ""how to compress your already thought out logic into something that somehow fits"". Opus Magnum however gives you too much freedom, so that it is not very demanding to find any solution (not talking about optimization here). Exapunks is just in-between, but the main reason for me favoring it over the other two games is mostly because I like real programming more than the visual stuff. The assembler-like programming language has a small enough instruction set that does not overstrain your memory but gives enough freedom for difficult assignments and optimization possibilities. The community is one of the greatest and there are lots of user-made workshop levels available. The only two things that I don't find optimal are the interface and the music. Debugging can be annoying, because you have to scroll through your code and having a few clones of Exas with many instructions greatly inflates the code shown during runtime. The soundtrack consists of too few tracks, so I disabled it early in the game. But after all, this is a very recommendable game! I have also stored TIS-100 and Shenzhen I/O in my library for next year, but from what I've heard, I don't expect them to be better than Exapunks.Edit: I now know that you can run your code until a set point with Alt+Click which helps a lot with debugging. I also started clicking more frequently the Exa drones on the screen to scroll automatically to the code junk which they run with. Its still not optimally laid out, but these were some improvements in my development process of the solutions."

Instead what i got is a TIS-100 type of game (which is another very similar game made by Zachtroics). It starts out pretty nice, there are some cutscenes and the whole thing looks slick. Then, you have to read some 'zines'. To make any progress, you need to read a PDF document, so you know what to do. You need to constantly ALT-TAB the game to read the PDF. Sometimes ALT-TABBING doesn't even work and i have to exit to the main room and re-open the zines.I never liked the fact that i have to read a user manual for TIS-100 to play the game, and neither in this game. This feels like work. This feels like when i buy a new tech gadget with really complicated mechanisms and i have to read a manual before doing anything. Very boring. I'm just gonna warn you that the experience is nowhere near Hacknet and you have to read. The game even suggests that you PRINT the zines out and staple them together, so you can get the 'full experience'. ♥♥♥♥ you.Refunding way easy tho so that's good"

Some people crave excitement of FPS. Some people want tactics of RTS. This game is for people that want satisfaction of their code beating problem - akin to beating dark souls bosses. Zachtronics have been producing programming puzzle games for at least a decade, and each one of them are reasonably varied. Unlike that other game, TIs-100 where limitation was half of the battle, Exapunks seems to be very loose on restriction.EXAs(unit of processing) has memories, can create storage at will and duplicate. Plus, there is no limit of code on EXAs either.(other than campaign limit.Going over limit will only disable scoreboard)While difficulties does increase, do does code limit. It is quiet good.Very much recommended if on sale, and if you are into this kind of thing.Later puzzle may require you to find out viable solution behind it. I sat on final puzzle for 2 hours.Minor complaints:While difficulty of campaign does generally goes up, Later missions have few easy ones sprinkled in them.For later missions, Play is too slow and FF is way too fast.If you have 20 EXAs(duplicated) with 100 code each, it is kind of hard to see what is going on.NO ""Step Back"" button."

It's probably the most challenging Zachtronics game I've played so far, even with some programming background. The limited ""hardware"" resources each EXA has available means solutions are rarely as straightforward as you first envision them and I've had to bust out a pen and paper to work through solutions on a number of occasions. Despite the difficulty, I think the early levels introduce programming concepts like variables, branching, recursion, scope, and race conditions gradually enough that the game is still approachable by someone with no coding experience. I reckon for most there's probably a solid 20-30 hrs gameplay in the main story alone. Definitely worth the full price in my opinion.Would love to see a standalone ""Hackstasy"" game that fleshes out the PvP mechanic even further."

It's a PDF file that you read on the side (I'm using my tablet).  I think I've gotten all the commands memorized now though, so you won't need it all the time, just when you are first learning.

I have completed maybe 50% of the Exapunks\ main campaign and the puzzles seem to be less challenging than in the previous game. The solution is straight forward most of the time and you just need to enter it as a code. The limitations are definitely less strict in Exapunks than they are in the previous game. And because of that you get less of those ""eureka"" moments as you had in Shenzhen IO where the space was limited and you had to fight for every line and exploit every code hack and look for the best algorithm. But nevertheless the game has its share of fun moments. I think it would be great for people who want to get the grasp of the concept of coding. As the basic idea is the same no matter what language you use. It's just the real programming language is more versatile as it is meant to be used to solve various problems other than just manipulating files as in Exapunks. .And  it is in the niche of its own.

716490,2,0,both,360,40,1,35.7,"July 3, 2019","Zachtronics has been making programming and engineering games for a long time, and they're super good. I think this one is no exception, and I think there is real innovation on top of previous electronics engineering games.A common complaint with this kind of game is that it quickly begins to feel like 'work', and while I think I got much further in this game before I felt that to be the case, with EXAPUNKS it still did feel like work. I write code for fun in my spare time, and there are cases where levels felt less fun than that. I think it comes down to a key design decision made by Zachtronics games -- that the language used in the game should be extremely simple and most particularly in the canon of these games: include no re-usable functions or higher-level operations, even code generation.See, the problem is that the fun part of each level is working out the way to optimally solve it, but the not fun part is the amount of repetition involved in that solution. Most puzzles do not involve writing a huge amount of original code, but instead repeating similar patterns by hand. The most common of these is loop unrolling, in which you make what would normally be a loop with jumps instead a flat procedure. this requires tracking labels and control flow to allow certain cases to fall through which is boring as hell. I don't want to open a level, be excited by the idea of solving it but totally deflated by the idea that I'll have to set up 30 labels and jumps again.As always with these games, my criticism is only that I can't take advantage of the most important thing in programming: reusable code. Just let me write a function library I can re-use in puzzles and I'd die for this ♥♥♥♥."

716490,2,0,theqwertydimension,49,3,1,50.1,"August 7, 2021","Pretty much everything about this game seems custom-built to tickle my personal sensibilities -- programming (and programming puzzles), ""hacking"", anti-authoritarianism, cyberpunk, the 90's, incidental IRC chats, arcade games -- so it's going to be hard for me to look at it objectively. Of course, if you like all those things too, you will find them gloriously realised in video game format, so go ahead and get it! But for everyone else, well, this is just a further refinement of the quintessential Zachtronics experience: write code to solve increasingly fiendish puzzles and, if you're so inclined, really stretch the limits in trying to optimise your solution in the face of the All-Consuming Histogram. It's a tried-and-tested formula for the company, and if you enjoyed any of the previous entries in the series, you're bound to enjoy this one. However, the amount of polish and charm that this particular game has makes it really stand out. Unlike TIS-100, which made me question halfway through the bonus campaign why the hell I wasn't just doing real programming instead (it would be easier!), playing Exapunks feels... cool. The writing and art does an effective job and the zines kick ass. Additionally, the barrier to entry is significantly lower than the two comparable ""coding"" titles of TIS-100 and Shenzhen I/O -- there's an actual tutorial! Also, the game will let you progress the story even if you have a terrible solution that overruns the size limit (you just won't get a leaderboard entry).This isn't to say that Exapunks is ""easy"", though; the later puzzles will take some work. Especially the bonus campaign ones. And man oh man there are some masochists over on the Steam Workshop, if you're looking for extra puzzles. The ceiling for the ""best"" solutions is really damn high for a lot of the puzzles, if you're looking to optimise. (Read the zines carefully! And maybe brush up on some rudimentary number theory...) I must however stress that none of this optimisation is required nor even really expected; it's just nice to have some depths to a game.In conclusion, Exapunks is a highly-polished assembly-language Zachtronics game dripping with attitude.

It reminds me of the Erlang/OTP way of programming. For example, maybe you need to explore a network and find something. Just send out EXAs in every direction. It doesn't matter if they end up running into a wall, because when they try moving in the direction of the wall they just die and clean up after themselves.I also think it's like, hilarious when the EXAs kill each other like. For one problem I made an EXA that keeps generating passwords for a locked device, and once it succeeds another EXA comes along and says ""hey, thanks for the password"" then kills it.The world is pretty neat. It's like an alternate version of 1997 that's weirdly more like 2021. I liked all the graphics and stuff.Difficulty wise it was pretty smooth, it gets pretty hard toward the end though, but nothing I got stuck on for more than a couple of hours.Story was kinda meh, but I'm not really playing for it.

I have enjoyed almost all of Zachtronics' games but limitations such as the pipework in tight spaces between the reactors in Spacechem  or the size of the circuit boards in Shenzhen I/O have sometimes frustrated me more than challenged me in a stimulating way. Perhaps I should have been more patient with myself as I struggled to figure out how to construct a working factory or device within the limitations of these games, but I think the average player might prefer to limit that struggle to the time after solving the puzzle when they wish to improve upon their solution. This is why I like EXAPUNKS. The challenges in this game come more from the complex logic underlying each puzzle than from frustrating limitations. It is the second Zachtronics game than I plan to finish the main campaign of, alongside Opus Magnum. I would definitely recommend this game first out of all Zachtronics' selection.(Also it's about time Zachtronics made a hacking-themed game.)"

You should have some background knowledge about the assembly language, because you program the puzzles in a similar language. The single sequences then take place e.g. in a national bank or other servers. The maps are arranged in the isometric perspective and your single programs run as small spider robots over the map. This looks a lot like cyberpunk, but without rain, violet colors and keyboard background music. The story is told very quickly. It is 1997 and you are a junk who needs money for his medicine. Through a chat a guy is chatting to you and from then on you have to solve tasks. The breathed on pixel design is atmospheric and fits to what you imagine under a hacker setting. Tutorials can be read in Zines and you can already see that people from the programming and demo scene were involved in the game.

In doing so I had to give up everything that made my life my life. My friends, my job, my family. I will never return to that place. All topped off with having to sue my own sister for my property, my first instance ever in court. Then retrieve that property(a 26 ft trailer) with a court order I was awarded, under duress, while my Brother-in-Law recorded me. I had never moved anything like that before. Needless to say, by the time I got to where I live now, I felt like ♥♥♥♥. Weeks of strain pushing me down a hole.And on that first day here, the special edition guide arrived in the mail. A guide I never paid for, but had spoken to Zach briefly about before I moved in which I told him nothing except I didn't have the money at the moment and was about to change location. No pity story, nothing about where I lived or suing my sister. He had no reason to do that, and I stood in my driveway crying with his guide in my hands. Could it have been a mistake? Yes, but I don't think it was. He will probably never know how much that meant to me at that time, and how much it means to me now. He gave me the first ""housewarming"" gift I have ever received, and the only congratulations I ever got for escaping that hellhole alive. Please support Zachtronics.

716490,23,4,76561198000790557,719,11,1,107.5,"April 15, 2019","The best ""Zach-like"" game yet. Even if it is by Zach. Another excellent puzzle game from Zachtronics.  If you've never played a game like this before, this is an open-ended puzzle game. By ""open-ended"" I mean there is a problem you are trying to solve, and you are given tools (in this case a programming language for what appears to be tiny robots) to solve it as you choose.  You build a solution to the presented problem. You win if the solution works but how you get to a working solution is up to you.  There are limits to your freedom both by the language and what the ""little robots"" can accomplish at one time. The puzzle here revolves around writing little program fragments that unfold through parallelization into pretty impressive results. It is a complete programming language (although a very simple one) and even has a little test-bed where you can make your own creation without a specific goal.Now if that sounds like a standard puzzle game. I'd say the big difference even compared to games like Lemmings, Portal, even World of Goo is that you have a lot of freedom to your approach.  That means while you may use a guide or a faq to help you.  You are usually not trying to guess the puzzle designer's intention explicitly. Although the way certain puzzles are designed to encourage a certain approach. You can usually design a solution that ignores the obvious solution. In fact, usually, the best solutions don't choose the obvious approach at all.  You are given the same set of tools at the first problem as you are in the last. The other big difference is that the steps to solve puzzles are usually quite elaborate. That means while you may use a guide or a FAQ to help you.  You are usually not trying to guess the puzzle designer's intention explicitly.  In fact, most of the guides for this game do not give explicit solutions because of this variance. Although the way certain puzzles are designed to encourage a certain approach. You can usually design a solution that ignores the obvious solution. Usually the best solutions don't choose the obvious approach at all.  What I think is ""obvious"" may well just be obvious to me. This style of game is now called a ""Zach-like"" after the programmer Zach Barth who owns Zachtronics.  Most games like this are developed by Zachtronics which develops games like this almost exclusively.In this game, the puzzles in the ""main"" story usually require you to learn a new concept. This is very well implemented here. It seems almost every puzzle has a particular ""concept"" it was trying to relay. I usually find this the cleverest part of Zach-lines especially compared to its competitors. Frequently, you have a puzzle description and you begin only to learn that the techniques you used in the last puzzle aren't enough You have to learn how to exploit the language in a slightly new way.  This, in my opinion, is Zachtronic's best-paced game in that regard. Each puzzle poses a unique challenge, and each was trying to teach the player a new technique building on what came before. Despite the minimal-hand holding this acing is the games best strength.The story in Zach's games always strikes me as better than they have any right to be.  It might sound like a trivial point, but he always adds characters and situations compelling enough to dive you to spend an hour or so trying to beat down these puzzles, there is very little hand holding after you start a puzzle so this motivation is sorely needed.  The setting is the late 90's and its fictional hacker universe is well researched and creative.  Having been a computer science student at the time it was very pleasant reliving some of the early ""cyber"" cultures of the period.  Your value in that kind of Nostalgia may vary. Honestly, the early hacking world before ""The Matrix"" and ""Facebook” and smartphones seem like a half-remembered dream to me. Anyway the ""hacking"" is even by the standards of the '90s more than a little fake. That's okay because this puzzle game is more of an enjoyable abstraction about little robots running an assembly language like code. A point the game lampshades itself in a particular puzzle. More realistic hacking simulations can be found in games like ""Hack-Net"". Those types of games are a genre in of themselves since Introversion's seminal Uplink and are puzzles of a sort but err more on the side of simulation and risk-reward strategies.  This game is about origami unfolding robots accomplish a set programming task more so than providing computer network defenses. If that sounds like a complaint, I will say I found this game much more challenging than most ""hacking:"" games. This one at least has you actually programming on some level. But the story does make for a very good premise for the puzzles whose premises are inspired by real hacking events.  One, in particular, is obviously referencing STUXNET and the Iranian nuclear program. If you have played a zachtronics game before this is one of the harder ones. It's about as difficult as SpaceChem or Shenzhen I/O.  It seems harder than Opus Magnum or Infinifactory.  Now that's just my opinion. Very hard to quantify difficult in games with this much freedom. A lot of people mention that the last game Opus Magnum doesn't have limitations on the number of instructions, parts, or space to design. There are harder limitations on space here. There are sometimes limitations on parts.  There is technically no limitation on the number of instructions you write but you are ""encouraged"" by the histograms to get underneath a set number.  I think Zachtronics is always at a balancing act between making a game ""too-easy"" by letting you freely design what you want or making it uniquely challenging through limitation. I like the balance here more than any other game. I think the story, difficulty curve, and pacing comes together in a very compelling way hereSo in short if you like hard puzzles games that really give you a lot of freedom to explore buy this game. If you're not sure and want less of a challenge than buy Opus Mangnum by the same developer. If you want something graphically interesting and don’t have trouble thinking in 3d space, then buy infinifactory also by Zachtronics."

716490,4,0,halfburnttoast,418,52,1,26.4,"April 6, 2019","Zachtronics shines again with a great game for dorks.  If you’re into programming, I can easily recommend EXAPUNKS as a programming-themed puzzle game. That’s still a pretty important distinction to keep in mind, going in. A large part of these types of games is working around the deliberate omission of things commonly found in programming languages (or even hardware functionality). So, solutions are more about cleverness than realistic or “good” programming. But, the positive side is that it keeps the code simple enough for non-programmers to pick up and use. I’d say the game is easier then ShenZhen IO, but also less frustrating to manage as you don’t have as much of a strict limit on lines of code. Overall, it’s a great puzzle game and with a buy."

This, on the other hand, I recommend to anyone pursuing computer science as a hobby or as a craft.I started playing yesterday and I've played for 9 hours (as of this review). It's addicting, and Zachtronics has a penchant for using story and features to motivate you. Indeed -- 9 hours in and I'm still unlocking completely new parts of the game (multiplayer, game sandbox, etc)!Brilliant soundtrack as usual by Matthew Burns; I've bought the OST on Bandcamp already.This game is far less restrictive than previous Zachtronics games. It still makes you earn it... but it's much more intuitive and you can get away with less optimal solutions. As always, the global histograms show you how you did compared to every other player -- another driver for better, efficient solutions.Warning: Another staple of Zachtronics games, there is a set of documentation. Despite some negative reviews, keep in mind: The documentation is *all* you need to know *everything* about the game. No need to look up mysterious information on Google. And *unlike* previous Zachtronics games, EXAPUNKS' documentation reads like a magazine instead of like technical manuals. Makes it a lot more readable.Wait for a Steam sale if you must, but put this game on your wishlist and challenge your friends to make better solutions.

Then look no further. Loosely based on BASIC, the game stars really interesting puzzles nested in an engrossing narrative, and is all presented with a  very solid UI that turns simple code into an active interface that helps visualize the coding experience. Even for somebody who builds software for a living, the puzzles can be quite a bit of a challenge. Though, it only makes it even more rewarding when you finally get your code to run, and have solved the problem elegantly.The 'Debugging Tools' (just a few options to test your code and see what it's doing line by line) are incredibly useful and provide the right amount of information to really step through things to figure out what isn't working and why. At first I wasn't a fan of the 'Zines' (pdf files that you can either just download or print for real on real paper), but as I got further in, I couldn't imagine this game using anything else. They provide helpful tutorials, rules of the programming language, and offer advice for further puzzles down the road. They're very well made, informative without being overly complicated, and just as crucial to the plot as anything that goes on within the game.Tl;Dr - This is easily the best puzzle game I have played in a long time, and hands down the best programming-centric game I've ever played.

Which basically means you write code, I mean not all zachtronics games have you write code, but technically that is what you are doing through a visual interface. The difference here is a little more wimsy and a little less soul crushing loneliness as you struggle in solitude against challenges that feel impossible. There is a pretty clear story, fun world-building and extras, interesting characters, and nice graphic design. The biggest complaint I have is that the coding language is way too simple for the game to be set in some future world. You don't even get proper for loops or the ability to store and recall multiple variables. You can't even use anything but integer values in code, strings seem to just be manipulable objects provided in levels and no other data type or structure is present than lists in files wothout index numbers. ALtogether this makes the coding annoyingly limited, and the challenges all the more devious. I hate this game so much I want to hurl my laptop across the room, but it hurts so good.

Seeing that a friend completed the same puzzle with a more efficient solution is fun and encourages you to think about solving problems in different ways. The puzzels can be challenging, but they are equally rewarding when you complete them. I wish more of my friends played this game, so I had more scores to compare against!

This isn't a hacker simulator like uplink or hacknet or other games in that genre, but in many ways its a much more real hacking game. Firstly the setting is fantastic - a 1980s alternate future. 1980s a time when the 2600hz captain crunch wistle was discovered by phreakers, bbs systems were taking off, and hacking was a counter culture movement. Magazines like 2600, really do read like the zines in this game. The chat system, an AI character called ember and various friends of Moss (Your character), really keep the game rooted in this world. Every virus you sucessfully run, changes an aspect of the Exapunks world, and it really helps with the story and immersion. The levels themselves are super. Each has a super varied settting from hacking your body to help stave off the phage, to banks, universitys, and many more. When working on a level, you probably will come across a number of small problems to solve within it. These problems are very unique to each level, requiring thinking outside the box to overcome the challenges. Like other Zacktronic games offer many different ways to solve them. with metrics to see how you stack up against other people. The learning curve of puzzles is good - giving you ample time learn all of the different commands and some of thier various uses. That is not to say the game is easy though, at times it can be challenging but not fustratingly so.  Exploiting all the systems!"

It is more compariable to TIS-100 than others, in that you do have to write code in a pseudo-language, but it is similarly easy to learn with a lot of tricks. Taking its vibe from the hacker subculture, you write code for virtual ""bots"" to manipulate themselves through servers and devices to get and add data or other effects (like hacking ATM machines). As with most other Zachtronics games, there is no one single right answer, you're given typically more than enough space/code to make non-elegant but working solutions, but there's always the challenge to reduce the amount of code, time to execute, and other factors, shortcuts that become essential in later challenges. And as usual, you're able to review your performance with your friends and global leaderboards. There's also unique hacker battle challenges that can pit your code against another player's, akin to old Code Wars, to see which algorithm better completes an objective.The devs have provided more than enough puzzles with a good learning curve, but it helps that Exapunks also has Steam Workshop support for user-added puzzles. There's also a Gameboy-like virtual gaming device that you can program for in the same language, of which people have also made unique games for as well.

However, it is not dumbed down or anything as real experts (not me) can still take better advantage of the games' commands and rules to create advanced solutions. After solving each puzzle, you can see how you fared compared to your friends and the rest of the world. Those interested in it (I sure am!) can then tweak their instructions to improve their ranking.I like that all instructions are documented and usable from the beginning (the only exception is a handy shortcut, but it does not change what you can achieve, only makes some solutions a little bit easier to write).

716490,2,0,Bakamoichigei,612,12,1,55.9,"November 23, 2018","(Edited 9/20/2019: Fixed typos)Yet another amazing programming puzzle game from Zachtronics!Between being set in an alternate cyberpunk version of 1997, all the references to 1990s hacker culture, and the usual Zachtronics gameplay which often makes you feel utterly brilliant upon solving a hard puzzle, this game ticks a lot of boxes. The (sometimes super-subtle) references to things like the movie Hackers and 2600 magazine hit me with a wave of nostalgia.The game comes with PDFs of two issues of an underground hacker 'zine, which serve as the manual, and cleverly tie in with the game itself in that you're actually given the 'zine in the game, and it becomes a driving force in the story.I got one of the last ""Limited Edition"" upgrade packs, which came with physical versions of the hacker 'zines from the game, and other items... Which is when I found out they are the exact same physical format as 2600. (I even have 1997 issues to compare against!)Speaking of story... There's voice-acted cutscenes where a lot of the story takes place, and they're a lot better than I would expect from an indie title of this scale.  I'm more used to voice acting on super-indie titles ranging from 'lackluster' to 'make-your-ears-bleed'.  But in the case of EXA PUNKS, it's perfectly good voice acting and that's a welcome surprise.A lot of story tidbits (As well as helpful tips!) are also delivered via a chat system on your computer's desktop, and it's a nice touch.The EXA system adds a new dimension to the programming puzzles of Zach's previous games like TIS-100 and SHENZHEN I/O, and it's a worthwhile addition for sure!The game is fun as anything; the occasional frustration of getting well and truly stuck on a puzzle is balanced with the feeling of that ""Eureka!"" moment when you figure out what to do... And then the feeling you get from improving upon that solution for the third time.The addition of multiplayer, in the form of hacker battles against AI opponents as well as people on your Steam friends list, just sweetens the deal. (And the first venue for these battles is a pretty clear reference to Hackers, so that's pretty awesome for us '90s nerds.) You don't even have to worry about making time to play against a friend; it's asynchronous multiplayer. You're basically going up against their current best solution. Like racing against their ghost in Mario Kart.The graphics and sound are also fantastic! The graphics are super-clean, have a great aesthetic, and look amazing, especially at 4k! The sound is really something... You can hear cars driving by on the rainslick street outside your character's apartment, and I often can't tell whether it's actually the game or real, haha...Bottom Line:Pros Another Zachtronics programming puzzler! The story and setting are deliciously cyberpunk. Definitely the pinnacle of programming game evolution after TIS-100 and SHENZHEN I/O Challenging but never impossible. Leaderboards, multiplayer, and custom puzzles add lots of replayability. Great graphics and sound! It even has a Game Boy-esque handheld you can write games for... In anaglyph 3D!!!Cons Not really for non-nerds. If you're easily frustrated, this'll drive you nuts sometimes. Will mercilessly eat countless hours of your time. I wish there was a lot more!Edit: Autumn 2019. Game continues to be awesome. Rock on, Zachtronics!🤘"

Successfully creating a working solution from scratch is deeply satisfying. Since these are open-ended programming puzzles, there is no one correct solution (although some solutions are much more efficient than others; there are optional high scores/histograms, for competitive folks).The in-game visuals are beautifully polished and eye-catching. This extends to the fictional zines as well, which not only teach the programming language, but also help to flesh out this cyberpunk vision of the late 1990s. The music is catchy but not distracting: an excellent accompaniment for one's programming flow state.Especially exciting for creative types is the inclusion of a fictitious gaming console, the TEC Redshift. Players can learn to create and share their own software for the Redshift.All told, this game is more than just a series of sandbox puzzles; the creator has taken great care to craft a quirky, intriguing world inside and outside of them. The result is a slick, stylish, and enjoyable experience."

Zines.  Plural.  That you actually *print out and bind*.It's a lot to get into if you're not a programmer and/or new to Zachalikes, but if you've played other Zachtronics games (like Shenzhen I/O or the TIS-100), you know what you're getting into - it's a logic-heavy puzzle game about writing Assembly programs, where ""READ THE MANUAL"" is mission-critical advice.In my experience, the puzzles can be a bit obtuse at times - there are some edge cases the manual doesn't explain, and the in-game level info box assumes you know what you're doing, when, in fact, you don't.  In those cases, there's not much to do but look up a level walkthrough, or experiment until something clicks.  Protip: if a compass of sorts showing link directions (e.g, to the left is 800, to the right is -1) is shown on the edge of a level, it's telling you how to connect to different hosts based on the direction you want to go in.  While it's fairly obvious for an actual 4-way compass with north marked on it, there was an earlier level with the same style of connection info that left me stumped for a few days 'till I tried ""LINK 800"" on a whim and found it let me connect, despite there being no numbered labels on the pathway.I wouldn't recommend EXAPUNKS to everyone - assembly is unforgiving and tricky to pick up, even if it's a simplified scripting-language version - but if programming puzzle games like Shenzhen I/O, the TIS-100, Human Resource Machine, etc, are your jam?  It's worth picking up.  If you're on the fence, wait for a sale."

There is enough processor power thrown at you that things like data structures, graph searches, sorting algorithms and so forth become possible.  It has most of the challenge and potential for real 'flow' that actual programming does, just without a lot of the annoying details that go with real life software development.The general asthetic is probably the best part of the whole game.  It is a really cool alternate late 90's universe, and it kind of grows on you.

As much as I do it when I need to, I generally think of it as a chore, but something about visually seeing the code behavior in front of me, step by step and so on rather than waiting for it to upload, then apply, then restart, then creating the specific environment to trigger it, made it way more entertaining.There were actually a couple of times where I was surprised by the leaderboards to discover I had a better optimized solution than a high percentage of the playerbase, then others where I was shocked to discover I'd somehow overcomplicated it by a ton. Now, fair warning, the game wants you to either have a printer, or two monitors, but I played a good half of it on a laptop, a crappy one at that, tabbing back and forth to reference documentation. That's right, DOCUMENTATION.

EXAPUNKS is both a series of coding puzzles using a basic coding language that anyone can learn quickly (no coding experience required) and a story line that progresses as you complete levels. The puzzles become more complex and force you to become more proficient with the coding language as the game progresses. One thing that makes this game like crack is the fact that your scores are compared to other players' scores. Completing a level is only the first step - you can spend a lot more time improving your code by optimizing for size or cycles (which usually require different solutions). I have 60 hours in this game and plan on spending a lot more. If you are an amateur programmer (like me), this game will likely make you better at writing and understanding iterative functions.

Even the easy ones were fun because you could spend some time really optimizing your code. Some of the last few challenges are quite difficult, and I wouldn't be surprised if people unfamiliar with programming will take a very long time to complete them. If you're unfamiliar with programming, I think you should be able to complete at least most of the challenges, and you will learn the basics of programming in the process (but not any useful programming language). I am an experienced programmer, and it took me 31 hours to complete the main campaign.I also played TIS-100, and this is much more satisfying, mainly because the size limitations were relaxed. I know the whole point is to restrict yourself, but TIS-100 took it too far. It'd be interesting (though maybe insufficiently challenging) to relax the restrictions a bit more, even, such as by allowing you to broadcast a message to all EXAs at once or grab multiple files.The environment was nice, very authentic to the intended scene/era.

716490,2,0,76561198237577814,44,39,1,36.3,"November 5, 2018","(I have 20 years of IT experience, and have programmed in various languages ranging from assembler to high-level. This review is subject to change, since I am currently at the radio station challenge, though the rating flag itself should not change)I remember the 1990s quite well. I was running bulletin boards of my own, as well as playing door games on Spitfire and Telegard boards. The culture I was a part of was separate from the real world. It was called cyberspace and we were called cyberpunks. I enjoyed the anonymity it offered, yet I was never a hacker though.In Exapunks, where the game's universe is in 1997, I get to play a hacker who is infected with the Phage, a disease that turns human flesh into useless computer circuitry and is terminal. In order to get the medicine that will slow the progress of Phage, I need to do work for someone named Ember-2. Despite the very human sounding voice that utters the odd ""Hmm"" and ""Huh"" Ember-2 is in fact an AI. The work involved is hacking networks, be it a pizza place, Berkeley UC, a highway sign, you name it, this game either has it or comes close to something similar.The tools I use to hack these networks are called Exabots, which are programmable viruses that look like little mechanical spiders. The programming language is a cross between COBOL and mnemonic assembler similar to Z-80A, which, after a few hacks becomes surprisingly easy to remember. KILL, HALT, COPY, WIPE ADDI, MULI, SUBI, DROP, GRAB..you get the idea.Don't worry if you haven't written a program in your life. You have access to Trash Magazine - a hacker publication and a VERY obvious nod to programming magazines like Radio Shack's 80-Micro - that will teach you the programming language and how to breach networks, access and change files, read data storage devices and repair your Phage-damaged body. Yes, as in your arm and heart for starters.Because the Exabots have limited storage capacity (basically registers), you can replicate additional ones to increase storage and perform parallel processing through inter-Exabot networking. With every successful hack the story advances. People you used to remember -- but no longer can because of the Phage -- come to your apartment to chat and check on you. Your own conversations with Ember-2 continue as well, and every time she utters something, no matter how friendly and matter-of-fact, you're left wondering what exactly is her agenda. She wonders how you feel about doing things for her in order to get medicine, yet at the same time muses about human behaviour being confusing and that there just doesn't seem to be enough disruption being caused. Oh yes, and her fascination in the inner workings of human physiology. The more you talk with Ember-2, the more unease you start to feel.The story itself is not the only thing that evolves. You also get access to other items like a portable gaming device and a Russian version of Solitaire. I don't know what else I can get access to, though I know you can make workshop challenges to share with other players to try hacking. I think you need to progress much deeper into the story before you unlock that but if I'm wrong, I'll revise the review and give credit to the person providing the correction.I needed to play this game for quite some time before I was comfortable enough to make a recommendation that was fair and balanced, and I recommend you buy this game for the following reasons.There's a surprisingly large and very supportive user community for a game that just started out of the gate. Chances are extremely good if you ask a question about the game in the Steam discussions, you'll get an answer and no one will make fun of you if you are struggling along.It's an excellent way to learn about programming if you're new. The language used in-game itself is not a real programming language but it has the aspects found in most programming languages...variables, arithmetic calculation, conditional branching, file I/O and parameter passing between applications. You can find out if programming is something you'd be interested in and it will introduce programming to you in a fun way.This next part requires some explanation. In some Zachtronic games, there is a workspace constraint on the solutions you come up with. In the case of Shenzhen I/O, it was the board size to place wires and chips. In TIS-100, it was a 12-node programming area to write code. I always hated that restriction. Always. I felt like I was being asked to build a car within the confines of a coat closet. As far as I'm concerned, if you can correctly add two to two to get four each and every time, that's enough.Thankfully, there's no such restriction in this game. It follows the same design model as the more open Opus Magnum where the sky's the limit in solution size. Yes, if you exceed the number of lines allocated for code, your solution will not be included in the histograms representing where you stand in comparison to other players, but your solution will advance the story. If you're okay with that omission, then all is good.The story itself -- as far as I've progressed with up to now -- is well written and engaging enough for me to continue playing. The challenges to complete will become more difficult as you progress, but it's nothing anyone can't solve without taking a moment to think it through. Suggestion: doodle out a solution with paper and a pencil first before writing the code. The graphics and UI are pleasing to the eye and streamlined enough to get to where you need to go.There are two nitpicks but not enough to matter. Treat it as a personal preference and not a genuine criticism.The first is the background music. It doesn't have the enjoyable etherealness of Opus Magnum's musical score. After a while it started to grate on my nerves so I muted the music. Apologies to those who like it.The second is the inability to access the workshop to create your own challenges to share with other pllayers until considerably later in the story. Shenzhen I/O and Opus Magnum allowed you to do this fairly early, but I am working on the radio station challenge and the workshop is still not unlocked. I wish it was unlocked earlier because the workshop can serve as a sandbox to play around in order to understand the mechanics of the game better in case you're not sure about something.A final point is the way data is exchanged between Exabots. I can either share data locally within the confines of a host on a network, or in the form of a global yell across the network. That's it. I cannot send data to a specific Exabot. That breaks a fundamental concept of networking. Just as an IP address identifies a printer, backup device, personal computer/server or communications device to send data to, I should be able to do something like:COPY 123 M:0to send the value of  123 to a replicated Exabot named Exabot A:0. I shouldn't have to worry about another of my Exabots grabbing the data before the intended target gets it. As I said, that's a nitpick and in one situation that had this, I found a workaround. I predict Exabots will be a runaway hit for Zachtronics, and good for them for the work they did."
716490,29,3,captain_internet,645,46,-1,23.7,"November 5, 2018","I'm flagging this as 'not recomended', even though personally I think it's mostly excellent. Why? Well: I think your mileage will vary considerably with this game. It won't teach you to code if this is your first experience of it; but if you've got some coding experience already you may well enjoy it. For those who do know what they're doing with software, quite often the path to a solution will be obvious. The challenge  is working out how implement that solution with a tiny instruction set and absurdly limited memory constraints. Individual EXAs (the things running the code) can typically only access two* values - X and T- one of which, T, gets overwritten with a 1 or 0 any time you do a test. A task like taking two numbers, comparing them, and then writing out the result becomes much harder than it would be in any modern language. You have to find workarounds, and new ways of doing things. These 'Eureka' moments are great when they happen (as I was typing the example above I thought of a really neat solution), but writing out the code again the second time becomes something of a chore. And you will be doing a lot of typing. And debugging is frequently painful, particularly when you've got 16+ EXAs executing things.In conclusion then: if you've not written code before, this is not the place to start. By all means try, but caveat emptor and all that. If you have written code before, you may enjoy the challenge that it offers- can you write code in the way it was written in the 1960s?If you are a professional software developer like myself, you'll almost certainly enjoy it, but at times it will feel like you've taken work home with you, and you're not getting paid for it, and you probably won't be putting it on your CV. *two other registers are also available contextually- F and M- but they have their own headaches associated with them."

The difficulty curve was absolutely perfect, the classic zachtronics print-outs were on point, as was the not-overly-complicated, but still interesting lore, and of course, the puzzles themselves were great in variety as well.Most levels will force you to use a new tactic or trick which you (likely) haven't used before, which makes it so that every level really feels like you're solving a whole new challenge, and not just playing the same level with a twist many times. This keeps the game extraordinarily fresh and interesting throughout, which was really my main complaint with most previous zachtronics games.There's plenty of room (and no pressure) for improvements in code for every level, in a way that you actually want to go back and re-do levels in order to optimize, so instead of the levels themselves being repetitive, simply replaying the levels can provide as much replay-ability as wanted.If you like programming/working through logical problems, this is hands down the best game I've every played for that particular genre.

It's so hard to do well and Zachtronics is just getting better at it.EXAPUNKS is a great entry in the Zachtronics games library that is significantly more approachable than TIS-100 or Shenzen I/O, but still delivers on the fantasy of 'Assembly' programming in a more approchable manner.  The art, the music, and the narrative all support it meaningfully - it's another piece of polish that makes these games great.In terms of dificulty, I feel right now that this game is easier than Shenzen, but harder than Opus Magnum.  The nature of writing code versus interacting with a moving, physical object almost necessitates that.EXAPUNKS represents the increasingly refined craft of Zachtronics as a studio.  It's the same thing, but better and different enough.  It's predictable, but is a welcome new addition to my library.  You probably already know if you'd like this game, but if you are on the fence, I'd encourage you to take a chance on EXAPUNKS."

Not only does it teach and/or improve your functional programming using a lean assembly code, it does this while exploring the current trends in software development - the cloud, distributed software architecture (modern websites could be thought of as running tens to hundreds of services/exas at the same time, communicating between each other with (M)essaging systems but running independently) and even some of the aspects of finally reaching human levels of complex machine intelligence.As far as the gameplay goes, Zachtronics has done a good job of combining a visual debugger with an IDE which you then use to perform tasks such as changing street signs or cooking doughnuts. Your head will hurt as your loops break, your code goes awry, and you iterate again and again. But it is a good pain and you'll definitely feel a sense of pride and accomplishment when completing a puzzle - or completing it better than before.PS.

There is a made up distributed programming language, there are lots of simply-stated levels with many ways to approach, there are three metrics to try to optimize for, and the debugging is very visual so it's easy to tell what's going on in your program. There is a lot of replayability, I'm 400+ hours in and still have plenty to do. When you first solve a level, you'll want to just get something hacky working. Then comes the part where you improve your solution - maybe you can split your code between two workers and speed things up 2x. The optimization has diminishing returns, you'll get the low hanging fruit first, and eventually you may get to a point where your solution feels very tight and hard to improve further. But then you squeak out another cycle or find a way to do the same thing in one fewer line of code and that is very satisfying.If it's something that motivates you, this game will definitely make you better at actual programming."

Whoever likes assembler programming should give this a go. Although the instructions and the processors have once again become more powerful,  for example with the addition of the division and modulo operations, this calls for some even more tricky puzzles, and they do get tricky.But with the available code space this is no longer a pain to beat if you just want to finish the game. The real headache comes, as always, but here in particular, with optimizing your code.With the much larger code line allowances it opens up a whole world of new possible solutions, making puzzles easier to solve in general, but harder to optimize. Finally you can even write as many comments as you want, which wasn't possible in earlier games, due to line and/or space restrictions.The only clunky thing that I wish they changed is that you can't rename your solutions from within the game.Also the manual, once again a very nice piece of art, is a pain to print. the pdfs are all in landscape format, which caused my printer to just print them on the top half of the paper, leaving the bottom blank.After rotating all pages, and printing again, i had to notice that the pages didn't quite line up to be put into a magazine format, with page 18 and 19, which were supposed to be in the center being the only page which was left printed on only one side.Overall an amazing game."

This is an awesome game and I'm totally hooked. I legitimately felt a little ""high"" after my first ""real"" hack, since this game made me learn and apply new knowledge in such a short time.Some recommendations for new players:I highly suggest you print out your Zine since you will be looking at it a lot! You should read the Zine up to and including the syntax explanations as soon as you get your first issue, only skipping the ""Ghast walks u thru it"" section. Then go for the tutorial and try to solve the first tutorial mission with Ghats help so you learn how to apply the syntax correctly. Starting with the second tutorial mission you should try to solve the issue yourself as best as you can do. If you need to resort to Ghats help, only peek as far as the next step so you don't spoil your learning experience. You should be able to solve tutorial mission 3 without any help from ghast. Read Ghats explanation afterwars, so you are sure you understand what you did. Ghats won't walk you through Mission 4 but explains how loops work in a general manner. I recommend you read his explanation since loops and ""if-checks"" (I'm no programmer so please forgive my wrong terminology!) are complicated. You should be able to solve this last tutorial mission by transferring Ghats explanation to the issue at hand. If you passed all that you are well equipped for your first hack."

There are awesome ideas there like hacking your own body, but the whole story just shows up as items in your inbox and it just ..lacks punch.

Exapunks sides too much on the puzzle side and not enough fun. Infinifactory and Opus magnum are the still the most fun games by Zachtronics I think.

Creating what works like code or a factory visually in 3d = fun. I can understand and do well in this game, but it doesn't look good to show off the finished product, it's not satisfying,  it's more like just doing a job.

If Infinifactory and Opus Magnum are your favorite Zachtronics games, and you're not a fan of TIS-100 or Shenzen I/O, you mostly likely won't enjoy this game as well (though it is a slight improvement over those).

So you fork and fork and write to files to get around that. [end of assembly rambling]After a while, the game seems to think a ""fun and challenging puzzle"" is to have you take the place of a simple word replacement/ file manipulation algorithm. Of course you have to alter files in precise ways, and can only hold one file at a time. So even files can't be used to work around the limitations discussed earlier.And of course, you must do nearly all levels to get to the next levels : it seems the game insists I must have my dose of chores inside the game so i may access the cool stuff, assuming there even is any cool stuff to unlock anymore.The few spoken cutscenes are nice, but most dialogue is written, and relatively poorly at that. I would have liked that some new instructions would be featured after a while, to expand a bit on the set that swiftly feels too spartan.My final review is very mixed. The game has a good potential, is very fun for the first 15 levels or so...But really, the potential didn't fuly reveal.The starting game is fun enough that i can recommend it for the first 15 levels.

Unlike other games of this genre, the open solution puzzle genre, and even Zaktronic's other games such as Space Chem or Opus Magnum, this game really brings the task of merely solving a puzzle in the forfront. For other games of this genre, the solution might be obvious so solving it might not bring satisfaction, or you might spend an arduous amount of time optimizing for the leaderboards just to get satisfaction out of the solution. The fact is, EXAPUNKS strikes that perfect balance between freedom and limitation where creating a solution feels really satisfying. I have a love/hate relationship with games of this genre because there are times where I would obsess over the 'best' solution, even to go as far as calculating what the fastest possibility is. EXAPUNKS however, im just proud of sitting back and watching the solution work, no matter where my score hits on the leaderboards. The puzzles all pose a different challenge. And the great thing is that the story provides a good amount of context for the puzzles. The story isn't stupendous to the point of recommending the game just for the story, but the world building is good enough to to really give a sense of drive towards your goals. Overall, it's a really tough game. At the time of writing this, I spent 16 hours on this game. I didn't even finish it. That's a lot of puzzle solving.

Hack a pizza place, if you hack a pizza place! Draw a picture of a pizza, if you hack a game dev kit!There's also some side-story about hacking your arm or something, but I haven't gotten that to dispense a pizza yet.Jokes aside, it's a Zachtronics game. After you've hacked everything, you make a bunch of specialized solutions to get on the left side of the histograms; You think about effeciency while not playing the game. There's solitaire as has become standard (Magnum Opus included), but also an action puzzler. If that's not shocking enough, there's also PvP (Punk vs Punk?). Haven't gotten to do any of that against real people, yet."

There’s something about Zach Barth’s games that make me really excited to play them. I’ve owned every game he’s put out on Steam. I still remember when EXAPUNKS was announced, I saw just the letters “Zach” based and got excited, so was that excitement warranted? Before we really dive in, I will say, this is an Early Access game, however, Zachtronics has published it as a Beta, in which the game is fully completable and should have almost no bugs. They are still working on minor fixes and getting community feedback, which they certainly have gotten. I normally avoid Early Access unless I have to play something for Humble Monthly Bundle, but for the fact that EXAPUNKS, as it stands, is fully playable and I’d call it close to finished. Patches are coming and fixes are being made, but the main game is complete. As such, I feel like this is an Early Access game I’m willing to review properly, and I don’t think the game looks worse for it.As you start EXAPUNKS, it’s a little weird. You first meet someone named Nivas offering to get you drugs for your disease. You then start by typing in a receipt from an executive for their expense report. It’s literally doing what Optical Character Recognition (OCR) already does for money, and it’s one of the few parts of the game where a big opportunity is missed. It’s not a bad section and I like the idea that “there’s not a lot of ways to earn money” but there are a couple of major issues I have at this point of the game.The story of the game starts by giving you the option of better and faster ways to earn money, to get drugs that you need for your sickness. The drugs aren’t available right now and their price is going to skyrocket soon most likely, so you’re in trouble.My biggest issue is that you don’t feel like you are in trouble. This is the beginning of the game, and you’re doing the OCR for money. However, you only do a single receipt, so you don’t get to feel the weight of the drudgery. I realize people would hate to do ten or twenty of them, but maybe two or three would work. Throw the player in after having done 6998 of these, so they earn the 700 dollars for medicine they needed, and then they realize they have to start over for the next payment and start the story there.The work the player is doing is rather odd as well. We have EXAs in this world, which are extremely tiny robots that can do anything even hack the human body. And yet we don’t have OCR for companies or it’s cheaper to have humans do it? Maybe even have the player forced to look at a failed OCR to find mistakes so they could fix an issue with the data entry rather than doing data entry that we’ve had for a couple of decades if not more.That’s a somewhat minor complaint, the other complaint is that the game talks about this Phage disease which is a major plot point. The player has it and it’s supposed to be affecting his body. The game is sold on Steam with the promise that you not only hack computers but hack your body, and the reason you need to is you have this disease called the Phage. The problem though is much of the game is built on this and it’s an interesting idea, but it’s never explored or made real inside the game itself. You will use your EXAs to cure you of pieces of the Phage, but the problem is it’s curing things you’re not experiencing. The game talks about not having control of your (left?) arm, but you never see it or feel it. The player is easily able to code, without any problems. There are also points where your vision is injured, and again you don’t have any negative repercussions from this.This is just an opportunity that’s lost, but the idea that I’m hacking my own body to make myself better sounded amazing and had a lot of potential. EXAPUNKS just doesn’t make it feel as interesting as it could, and I wish there was something more that tied me to the feeling of helplessness the game wanted to present. A cutscene, even a coding challenge where I had to do something that was a little frustrating for a piece, or a cool visual trick when I’m having eye problems and can only look at the mouse cursor could have brought the problem to life. None of that happens though, you just “have the Phage” and then you fix parts of your body that doesn’t change anything.These are really the big issues I have with the story. In the initial scene, you meet Nivas, a delivery girl who offers you meds. Soon after that, you’ll meet Ghast who writes a ‘zine, similar to 2600, and Ember-2, a Computer AI. Each character is interesting, though Ember-2 is really the only character that’s around long enough to have a lot of character development. The game tries to develop Ghast and Nivas as well as having a third character pop up, but the fact is… there’s really not enough time for the other two to have any development, and the third character, only appears for a single scene to set up a level, which could probably have been done with Nivas instead.Ember-2 though does get a lot of interesting development, but it’s a bit backloaded, the final three or four missions have a number of big reveals worth hearing, but it comes very late in the game.At the same time, I’m talking about the story, in a game where the focus is on programming robots. If you’re coming for a story, you’ll get an acceptable one here, but not one worth buying the game itself. You should be picking this game up for the programming, and the story is the icing on the cake. I am nitpicking the story because there are small flaws that really took me out of the experience, and could have improved the initial experience, but we should talk about the actual gameplay.Perhaps I should say “gameplay” in quotes, as Exapunks is a rather odd game. After the first level where you type in the receipt, you meet with Ghast, as I mentioned, and he hands you a ‘zine. You can open this ‘zine as a PDF or one of two printable versions. This is actually your instruction manual for the game. It’s a rather clever delivery method, and I absolutely adore it.Inside the zine is “Ghast walks u thru it.” This is actually a tutorial for the beginning of the guide that takes you through the next four levels. The first two levels pretty much just require you to type in a solution in the book but also explains exactly what is happening, and it’s worth following if you’re new to programming or just don’t get it right away.The third and fourth “tutorials” are more focused on suggestions, trying to get you to figure out the solutions while teaching you the tools of the trade, communications between two EXAs, and loops and conditionals. After that, the game throws you in the deep end and there are no more hints, it’s time to actually code your solutions from scratch, and in reality, that’s where the game is going to be for the rest of the levels.If you want to read more and see a final score, you can see the full review with pictures and video athttps://kinglink-reviews.com/2018/09/03/exapunks-review/.

716490,1,0,shockwolf10,556,25,1,11.2,"September 2, 2018","I've tried a couple times to get into Zachtronics games. I played Spacechem, and found it enjoyable, but I bounced off of it after only a few hours. I tried again with TIS-100, which I managed to get further into in spite of its spartan presentation, but ultimately I bounced off of it as well after only about six hours. Finally, finally, I've found the Zachtronics game for me. If you like hacking, programming, the cyberpunk genre, or feeling like a genius, this is the game for you, too.EXAPUNKS is a delightfully cyberpunk game about hacking everything. Set in the far-flung future of 1997, EXAPUNKS puts you in the shoes of a washed-up hacker who's lost their skills and is dying from a mysterious disease that turns the human body into junk circuitry. The medicine you need to survive is prohibitively expensive, and so you're forced out of retirement to hack various things on behalf of a mysterious benefactor known as ""Ember-2."" Unlike the previous Zachtronics games I've played, EXAPUNKS has more of a narrative focus. There are VN-style cutscenes with voice acting at critical moments, and these moments provide a believable context for the challenges you face. The setting is a wonderfully realized cyberpunk retro-future (though perhaps ""alt-history"" is more appropriate); the music, character designs, and mechanical designs all create a wonderfully atmospheric and lovingly authentic 90s cyberpunk experience. Perhaps it's because of the presentation and the narrative context provided, but the challenges you face clicked with me much more readily than they did in Spacechem or TIS-100. Much like TIS-100, you're provided with zines chock-full of setting information and mechanical tutorials, acting as both a game manual and as a narrative device for worldbuilding. Much like in TIS, you're using a faux programming language to solve problems, but the extremely tight limitations from TIS-100 are relaxed here. There are limits to the length of your code, but they're usually somewhat generous; most missions don't restrict the number of EXAs, your little automated execution agents that carry out your programs, you can use; and unlike in TIS-100, EXAs have two registers that can be read from and written to directly.A number of challenges in EXAPUNKS are multi-faceted; for example, one level has you accessing a library's ebook server, locating specific books based on their call number, copying the contents of the books into another file elsewhere in the server, and then deleting all of your EXAs. The call numbers, however, are different for each of the 100 trial runs that all levels require you to complete, so you're prevented from simply hard-coding specific solutions and are instead forced to create flexible, versatile programs that can handle a variety of situations. Thus, when you discover a solution and then watch your EXAs carry out your incredibly complex sequence of instructions, you feel like a genius. As with many prior Zachtronics games, EXAPUNKS features minigames. For you Shenzhen Soiltaire fans, a form of Solitaire is indeed present, though this time it's Russian-flavored. There is also a head-to-head hacking mode, where you pit your EXAs against another player's EXAs to complete specific objectives, If that's not your cup of tea, you could always play a few rounds of HACK*MATCH, or, if you're feeling particularly ambitious, you could even choose to program your own games using the development kit for the Redshift handheld gaming system. I hesitated to buy EXAPUNKS due to my prior inability to stay focused and stick with Zachtronics' games, but I eventually pulled the trigger, and I'm extremely glad I did. I haven't been able to put it down since I got it. Buy it! Hack the planet!"
716490,23,1,suigeneric,788,73,1,65.4,"September 1, 2018","At long last, he has finally done it - there is finally a Zachtronics programming game which is accessible to the non-programmer.There are many points of differentiation between this and the impenetrable TIS-100, and the only marginally less abstruse SHENZHEN I/O. The most immediately apparent is the visual element. Your packets of code are represented by little robots (EXAs) which wander about the environment, physically picking up files and manipulating them in accordance with your instructions. Much like Spacechem's waldos, at any given moment you can see exactly where they are and what they are doing. Why can't I interact with this file? Oh, it's being held by another EXA. Why can't I create another file? Oh, there's no room in the grid. I don't need to work out what line of code contradicts another line because I can see the EXA explode when it is unable to execute an instruction.Second is the robustness of the instruction set. Where TIS felt like trying to parallel park a car without a reverse gear or wheels into a space half its size, EXAPUNKS gives you the commands you need to more-or-less directly perform the tasks required. For starters, in the far-distant cyberpunk future, computational technology has become so advanced that you finally have access to all four arithmetical operations! Whoah! You can write loop sequences anywhere in the code, have the loops trigger conditionally or unconditionally, relay data to other EXAs through global or local channels, replicate an EXA with the child beginning operation at any defined point in the code, terminate an EXA's code sequence externally by killing it with another EXA, and much more. Again, like Spacechem, with a tiny bit of creativity you can implement de facto code chunks to limit the number of times a loop is performed or sync up your EXAs, and this is just the stuff that a neophyte like myself could work out. I'm sure that there are yet more powerful tools available to someone with a bit of experience. You also have immediate read/write access to 3 registers - they serve different purposes and only one offers unconditionally permanent storage, but this is a huge boost from prior games.Thirdly, the space you have to write code is now infinite (or at least, it will be in the next update). Not hip to extreme optimisation techniques? No problem! Your code can be as clunky and amateurish as you need it to be, and the only penalty for exceeding the size limit will be the refusal of admission to the leaderboards. Given how embarrassingly bad such code is, this is arguably a blessing in disguise. The game still runs through 100 permutations of the puzzle, so you can't just brute force a specific solution - you need to work out generally applicable code - but if you satisfy that sole criterion then you're golden.Finally, the reliance on mathematics is drastically reduced. I detest maths, and its prominence in TIS and SHENZHEN was a massive turnoff. Most puzzles in EXAPUNKS will only require the use of numbers to the extent that they can be used to direct e.g. go to host 800, grab file 277, find the 6th data packet within it etc. There are a few exceptions, but nothing that would require an understanding of much more than basic arithmetic. If I can do it, truly anybody with a couple of neurons to rub together can do it too.In keeping with the longstanding Zachtronics tradition of crap tutorials, the tutorialisation in EXAPUNKS is... actually pretty good, though that comes with a caveat. In the first four levels, the manual literally tells you verbatim what code you should write and what it does, line by line. The fifth level drops you off a precipitous cliff and demands that you use new commands in new ways. This is very frustrating, but if you RTFM you should be able to claw your way back up to stable ground. Thrice I was on the verge of asking for help on the forums, but each time I found that what I needed to know was in the manual - I just needed to read it several times over to achieve adequate comprehension. Every individual type of puzzle in the game (and there are many) has its own section devoted to explaining its intricacies. This is a level of assistance I have never seen before from Zachtronics, and it should be applauded.It is possible that the concessions to accessibility might leave some more experienced coders feeling a bit lukewarm - as a huge Infini/chem fan, I felt the same way about Opus Magnum - but the beloved histograms are still there, pushing you to voluntarily shave off an extra cycle or two. I'm not sure if I'll finish EXAPUNKS - it's always possible an insurmountable wall of maths could appear in the next puzzle - but at this point I feel I've seen enough of the game to say I've got my money's worth. I'd recommend this to basically anybody who is a fan of any previous game in the Zachtronics catalogue.Edit: Just finished it! Man, was that satisfying."

716490,3,0,barthvader95,201,6,1,15.3,"August 31, 2018","DISCLAIMER: Didn't beat the game yet. It's basically Yet Another Zachtronics Game Where You Write Stuff In An Assembly-ish Language They Made Up, after TIS-100 and Shenzhen I/O. If you liked the aforementioned titles, you probably bought this one already, then beat it, and then decided to read reviews because you were bored. If you found those games too restrictive, good news -  EXAPUNKS gives you more space to work with, not unlike their non-assembly title, Opus Magnum. Is it a bad thing? I'm not sure - once you figure out the kinks of the EXA [EXecution Agent] programming language, the puzzles stop being challenging and start being tedious if you just want to find a solution and move on, as opposed to furiously optimize to reach the tenth percentile.At some point I've realized this is all similar to an Operating Systems class I was doing for my CS degree, when I needed to manipulate some files with a Bash script in a specific way to get a passing grade. Considering someone else's review was complaining about the lack of a 'ls' command, I wasn't the only one who sees it like that. Did I enjoy it? Yes. Does that count as a puzzle? I'm not sure. On top of that, for a game about hacking you spend surprisingly little time breaking into things, everything is online and unprotected like a drunk teenager's wee-wee and you just wander around like you own the 'net, but that's just a nitpick, I suppose.Everything that isn't the puzzles themselves - the graphics, the music and the worldbuilding - is crafted well enough, and tailored to immerse you into the plot. The human characters are passable (the voiceovers rub me the wrong way though), but most of your interactions are with the mission control AI that gives you tasks while trying to figure out humans, with varying results. The in-universe manuals make a comeback and they're fascinating to read, providing bits of lore on top the usual tutorial stuff needed to figure out the kinks of the EXAs.Bottom line? It's good, with a caveat that you need to be the type of person who enjoys writing Bash scripts to manipulate files en masse. If you're not, give Opus Magnum a go instead."

Memory is very limited though, which makes it challenging to transfer and modify data.Even though story is obviously not the focus, the world around you is interesting and the game manages to create some tension near the end.All in all this game feels like the best game by Zachtronics to date and is a definitive hit for programming fans."

Probably because the story seems more engaging, with cutscenes and the like. I quite like that, Zachtronics seem to just refine the formula to make better and better games :DThe challenge in my opinion (though I've done programming before) ramps up rather slowly too, which I don't consider bad, it gives you time to get used to the instruction set.My one point of criticism is as with any Zachtronics game, I'd like some overarching world to it all. This one does this more so than the other games did, but it still feels like jumping between menus more so than being part of a world. But possibly adding the features I desire would mean it is a different genre and not as appealing to the rest of the gamers that like this kinda game.Oh, and bigger leaderboards (or scrollable) would be nice."

716490,18,0,76561198018902841,577,9,1,35.6,"August 27, 2018","TL;DR: While Zachtronics previous game may have been named ""Opus Magnum"" their newest gem ""Exapunks"" easily deserves the title Opus Magnum for being their best game so far. As of writing, i spend 34 hours on this game: More than my playtime for Zachtronics previous games (Opus Magnum, Shenzen I/O, Infinifactory and TIS-100) combined. If you like programming puzzlers this game is a must buy without any form of caveat emptor attached. Exapunks Exapunks is the latest game in Zachtronics niche series of programming puzzlers which earlier produced the equally great titles Shenzen I/O and TIS-100. Compared to the earlier titles Exapunks feels larger and more importantly more accessible thanks to some changes to the games design. Two major positive changes compared to previous titles were an increase to the amount of code one can write to solve a level and the possibility for parallelization by spawning more EXA's (The small spider-like bots you program). These two changes combined allow a lot more freedom while solving levels as each level now has multiple solutions (conceptually different solutions, not just slightly code). If you - like me - managed to get stuck in Shenzen I/O and TIS/100 for extended periods of time because you couldn't think of a solution that was space efficient things will be much better this time around.The in-game leader boards present in previous titles also make their return: After solving a puzzle a leader board is displayed which shows how efficient your solution was compared to other players. After all: just because something works doesn't mean it works well! These leader boards are a source of additional challenge for those interested: Trying and managing to figure out how another players design managed to be twice as efficient has a certain satisfaction to it. As a positive note: Unlike Shenzen I/O there are no unlocks during the game. So if someone has a better solution than you they made it using the exact same tools. Game Content As a game, Exapunks offers plenty of puzzles and - as expected of Zachtronics games - plenty of side content packed in a box filled with a lot of ambience and atmosphere. Put into numbers the game currently offers:  33 Levels 4 Hacker Battles 2 Sidegames 1 Redshift Level Editor 2 PDF Manuals Multiple cutscenes  Note that this list was quickly self-counted during Early Access and may thus be incomplete or change as time progresses. Levels, Levels and even more Levels The 33 levels in the game are storyline missions that provide a specific objective to be met by programming a set of EXA bots. The storyline itself is relatively simple but each level had a unique enough objective that it doesn't feel repetitive at any phase in the game. In addition to the 33 regular levels there are 4 Hacker Battle levels. Hacker Battle levers are two-player levels where each player program's EXA's to reach an objective while the other player tries the same thing (While trying to interfere with the other player). Initially these levels are played against an NPC and are just like a regular level, but after beating it they can be replayed against Steam Friends. A game within a game within a game... Zachtronics previous game Shenzen I/O had a minigame of Solitaire included that was later also released as a stand-alone. Exapunks continues this trend by including not one, but two in-game games as part of package. As before both are fully optional aside from a Steam Achievement. Aside from the unrelated sidegames Exapunks contains a level editor that allows one to create and share levels through the steam workshop. If previous titles are an indication, this is will likely extend the games longevity by a nice margin after its release. Besides the lever editor there is also the ""Redshift"", an in-game gameboy-like console. The Redshift is a sandbox game level without code limitations and without an objective. The interesting part is that it simulates a console including press able buttons which can be programmed using the exact same EXA's used in the game levels. As with the level editor games made for Redshift can be shared between players; In this instance trough an .jpg image that can be imported into the game. Game atmosphere and ambience As a programming game Exapunks had a manual - two, in fact - which are required to even understand the game. In this case ""Manual"" actually sounds like an insult as this is no dry document explaining the games rules. Both manuals are styled as hacker magazines containing not only an explanation of the game (EG: programming EXA's) but also articles with background information, (fake) advertisements and explanations for game levels written as if send in by another person who wanted it published. Also of note is the (fake) chat-box within the game. This chat-box contains fellow hackers who will chatter about after you complete a mission. This can be entirely random chatter, but also feedback related to your mission (Effects of your actions for example). While this is not a major feature it adds to the sense of immersion and atmosphere that this game has aplenty. No, i am not writing a sorting algorithm! I am busy checking pressure values on the centrifuges of a rogue candy factory in order to disable them in the right order! Conclusion If you actually read the entire review: Congratulations! Somewhere in the middle of this review i mentioned my in-game trouble writing compact code and i suppose that ""inability to be brief"" also holds true for writing reviews. In my defence Exapunks is a unique and very diverse game that simply had a lot of content to cover if one wants to mention everything. All in all: Great game, well worth a purchase and well worth writing over 5.000 characters in a review for."

716490,0,0,flightsin,118,17,1,28.4,"August 27, 2018","It's another Zach-like, the latest iteration in the niche genre of programming puzzle games that also includes previous Zachtronics titles TIS-100 and SHENZHEN I/O. If you've played either of those (especially SHENZHEN) then EXAPUNKS will feel like a new variation on a very familiar paradigm.Game mechanics are fun and original enough, and the programming language is fairly easy to get into. You have a decent amount of freedom and flexibility in solving the puzzles, as the game places little arbitrary constraints on you. This makes it more accessible than SHENZHEN, which I personally found much more restrictive.The difficulty ""curve"" is more like a square wave. Like its predecessors, I've found that EXAPUNKS' puzzles lie in one of two possible categories: the ones I can solve immediately, and the ones I spend hours on. You either just ""get"" them, or you don't. Having said that, none of the puzzles are too frustrating to get though. The real challenge is in optimizing your solutions, but you can decide for yourself how far you want to take that.Graphics, sound, and story are all nicely polished and create a great retro-futuristic 90's atmosphere that's surprisingly immersive. Included minigames are cute, but not something I found myself opening the game for.Definite recommendation, provided you enjoy programming puzzles."

It's rare that a game immerses me as much as this one did.If you've played other Zachtronics games, you know what to expect in terms of gameplay. Solve the puzzle, and then optimize your solutions to try to beat everyone else's scores. This game introduces a new puzzle type that directly pits your bots against your friends, enabling more friendly rivalry as you go back and forth trying to create an unbeatable program.

I've bought every game they've released, as soon as it was available. With that said - I do think it's really ironic that a game that encourages (and requires) you to write efficent, tight code has such a phoenomenally long load time. It takes my laptop (intel i5, windows 7) about 5 times longer to start the game and begin playing than it does to do the same in Skyrim. I can't imagine what Exapunks is 'loading' during this time, it can't possibly have as many resources to load as a graphic-heavy AAA title. Will adjust my review when/if this loading issue is fixed.edit: Adjusted review to positive - issue not fixed, but this is a tremendously fun game.

For those of you that have played those games in particular the learning curve is nowhere near as steep.I do not code or use computers for a living which does make the learning curve (and the game in general) harder.

A light but effective narrative (with 2D cutscenes and the occasional voice-over) is sprinkled on-top, Redshift (a programmable micro-console to make your own games), the async PVP levels and the two mini-games top off the whole package.These aspects make this the most refined installment in the Zachtronics library!

Anyone who's enjoyed TIS-10 Or Shenzhen I/O knows what they're going to get with this and it's more of that. There's enough differences between the three games for EXAPUNKs challenges to feel new and fresh, and as always there's the same depth you'd expect from a Zachtronics game where there's the 'just get it done' level and then the 'do it fast' level.I love the setting, almost ripped straight out of a William Gibson novel. The art and design of this thing, along with the story and the surprising addition of voice acting now... it creates a very atmospheric game. The design propagates into the puzzles, too, with each level having its own unique design and setting whether it's a bank or a shop or anything.It feels like this is the best of this pure coding Zachtronics games but... for me, I have to say, this isn't quite as fun as Opus Magnum was. I miss sharing those gifs on social media. I miss the visual thing. In hindsight solving problems visually is just more like fun and less like my job.Take this setting and combine that with an opus magnum style way of solving puzzles and you might have my ultimate game.

As with previous Zachtronics titles TIS-100 and Shenzhen I/O, this is achieved by programming in a language similar to assembly.  As with earlier titles, this is a game of programming within constraints: in TIS-100's case, the constraints are those of little space for code, few registers for storing values, and complex IPC arising from the parallel nature of the TIS-100 computer.  For Shenzhen I/O, again code and register space was limited, and there was an additional challenge of laying out the position of components in order to allow room for data lines etc.In the case of Exapunks, many levels have a limit on the number of lines of code in total which may be used, but those limits are not too harsh, and may be shared among as many EXAs as you like.  The limit on available registers is still quite constraining - you have one general purpose register, another which holds the results of test operations (but other than that may also be used for general purpose values), one to allow file access, and another for communications between EXAs.New EXAs may be forked from existing ones too, creating a copy  with the same code running in it.  As ever with Zachlikes, the puzzle design is magnificent, presenting a good variety of challenges and a fairly smooth difficulty gradient.Of Zach's games to date, this one has the most emphasis on story, too - an alternative 90s tale with all the requisite cyberpunk stuff: AIs, weird diseases that turn people into electronics, hacking, conspiracy etc.  As ever, some great supporting materials and documentation too.This is also the first of Zachtronics' titles to feature multiplayer challenges (competitive levels where you may try your best solution against those of others on your friends list in the style of a bot arena) and Steam workshop integration for designing and sharing user-made levels."

This is an amalgamation of best sides of previous games and correction of their past mistakes. This game is no doubt the one I'd recomend to get acquainted with subgenre of open-ended puzzles. +:1) Difficulty - easy to complete, hard to optimise. Fans of Shenzhen I/O and TIS-100 remember how used language was quite restrictive (at least I felt so), however now you have FULL ARITHMETICS with THREE ADDRESSES. EXAs provide a lot of additional very interesting tools like replication, global and local shared memory, more functional (compared to shenzhen I/O macros). 2) Music - each track is perfect match with the gameplay and can be listened to outside the game without any loss of atmosphere.3) Pretty good tutorial - basics of language usage are finally shown via worked examples instead of remembering half of manual. 4) Setting and world - basically combination of sountrack, artstyle, plot and the most interesting part - local chat, where participants often comment on consequences of your completed missions.5) Manual - very cool, styled after self-published magazine and each part of manual has an article, often with a story from writer. It is interesting to read as a short fiction.-:1) Some parts of manual are not immediatelly clear (the disk part, for example).Overall it is a must-buy for Zach fan - be it hardcore bit-blaster, atom arithmetic specialist, involuntary production engineer, alchemy artisan or embed connoisseur. Puzzle fans should consider trying it out - there is a great chance you will like it. Even though it is great, open-ended puzzles are as specific as mockumentaries for horror lovers.

There are small bots called exabots that can traverse the electronic universe, read and alter data, cause power outages, realign satellite disks... your task is to program these exabots, sometimes to repair nerve connections in your arm or eye.The game is made up of puzzle levels. There's always a task to achieve usually without leaving a trace, such as making ATMs spit out 20 dollar bills and leaving no exabots behind. The problems are open ended, you just have to write code that solves the problem. There's always a way to improve, to make exabots solve the problem faster or write smaller code, or have less exabot activity.If you've ever played a Zachtronics game, you know what you're getting into. Unlike Shenzhen I/O and TIS-100 you aren't lacking in space to make your solultions. The programming language of the game is also a bit more powerful, so don't need to make up for the lack of instructions yourself that often. There's multiply, divide in game. There are new restrictions to deal with so there are worthy brain teasers in game.If any of this sounds good to you, you're probably one of the people that will enjoy it and I highly recommend it.

The mechanics are always awesome, but this one manages to be a lot more immersive, surprising for an assembly puzzle game. There's an actual story and narrative and it feels a lot like there progression as you solve the puzzles, but the puzzles manage to stay extremely interesting.I think even non-programmers could get into this, but at its heart it's a puzzle game where you write algorithms to solve the puzzles. It's a niche that's very fun, but you have to be patient and have to want to learn all the unique rules for the algorithm language. It's like assembly, but even programmers who know assembly will have to read the rules for this one, and you still will have to experiment a lot. It's new territory for anyone, programmer and non-programmer alike.Overall, A++ puzzle game. Another amazing Zachtronics game, and so far my favorite!"

(And god knows if anyone gets the reference.) Luckily someone's got a reason to keep you alive; work for them, and they'll provide the supplement.EXAPUNKS is yet another programming simulator from Zachtronics, combining the good parts of Shenzhen I/O, Opus Magnum, and Ruckingenur II.Compared to the other games (especially Opus Magnum), the early story is a little thin. There's voice acting, though, so there's that. The programming language takes a little getting used to, especially if you've played a lot of any of their other programming games (for example, I keep going JMP when this language uses JUMP); but the curve isn't all that severe; the worst of it is probably remembering that conditionals are now linked to the same TEST command, instead of having multiple seperate commands, like JLZ or TGT. If you're new to Zachtronics, the game nicely gives you a tutorial to help you get used to the language and how the parts work. It's not going to hold your hand for long, though, and you will almost certainly need to reference parts of the included manuals to figure out certain things.While there's an upper cap as to how many lines you can fit into a solution, this cap is usually around 50 or 100 lines, and it's across all your EXAs in your initial deployment, meaning that you can usually eke out more space with loops and replications, or fill in space by unrolling loops. As with other Zachtronics, you're not expected or required to make a ""best"" solution - as long as it fits, put whatever works.Level progression feels nice; while the game adds multiple micro-mechanics to each of the early levels, with the exception of replication, they feel like natural extensions of the mechanics you already learned (for example, searching for a value that contains ""peanuts"" and manipulating it comes in handy a little later when you need to collect a string of values corresponding to someone's bill). I do kind of wish replication was touched on a little bit more before a level involving branching replication showed up, but it's ultimately a small complaint about a level I'm having a bit of trouble figuring out.tl;dr: Great for Zachtronics programming veterans, more generally accessible than TIS-100 or Shenzhen I/O (but not Opus Magnum)."

716490,50,3,Siegen,337,9,1,21.8,"August 9, 2018","A highly polished puzzle game that should be quite fun for anyone interested in programming puzzles. The game is much more engaging than previous titles like TIS-100 thanks to loads of beautiful retro art and a more fleshed-out narrative. The game is still more complex than the likes of Human Resource Machine but seems significantly more approachable than something like TIS-100.Seems to work quite well on linux, too.As for a criticism, this game falls into the same stat trap as HRM. After completing a puzzle, you're presented with the number of steps your solution took and the number of lines of code you had (allowing you to optimize for space or for speed, as programmers are taught to do). However, some puzzles will have a specific solution that is highly optimized for one or the other. That solution tends to essentially rely on hardcoded exploitation. Each puzzle requires you to pass 100 randomized tests (like fuzzing tests) to make sure you didn't just hardcode the solution for the one specific problem you were given. But that randomization doesn't always go far enough to catch all the edge cases.Case in point, the puzzle where you have to empty the bank's ATMs. You're only allowed to empty one bill at a time from a given ATM and fail if you request something from an empty ATM, so the ""nominal"" solution averages something like 3000 cycles. However, the ""randomized"" tests never seed an ATM with fewer than ~30 bills, so the speed-optimized solution is to have two loops: one empties 28 or 29 bills in a row before checking on the counter and another empties one bill at a time, once the counter gets below 28 or 29. That drops the time to around 1000 cycles or so.  But it's clearly not representative of the spirit of the challenge (where an ATM certainly could have fewer than 20 or 30 bills).Similarly, there was another puzzle where the speed-optimized solution was just to copy and paste the same line many times in a row before entering your loop, as none of the tests required fewer than a certain number of iterations.Half of real-world programming is just error-checking and cautious code to navigate all the edge cases. It might be nice if programming puzzle games (after so many iterations) didn't allow so much latitude for overfitting solutions to the exact parameters of a given problem."

Besides that there are a few puzzles that I feel are out of place, making the game excruciatingly hard out of nowhere, and the progression of the game, where you only have a couple puzzles at a time to work with, actually makes the player get stuck on a level until they figure it out, which is usually when I pull out the zine and curse everyone even remotely close to me.Besides those nitpicks I've found that the game is really good and when I stopped playing to write this I kept thinking about the level I'm on and wanting to test out solutions, which is the important thing about puzzle games."

This game, like the other pseudo assembly language games from Zachtronics, also comes with a manual stylised as a hacker zine which is a really nice touch. Along with the IRC channel where you get reports on what your hacks have done creates a really interesting atmosphere and world. Oh, and not to forget the music which is brilliant.For extras, it comes with a solitaire game (I think all the games since SHENZHEN I/O have one except Opus Magnum but I haven't gotten far enough in that game to be so sure), a tile matching game and programmable gameboy-like device to distract you from doing the main puzzles.Recommended for anyone interested in programming or computing"

However while this is a game in which you program, the programming is not equivalent to real programming. Exapunks contains a very low level programming language similar to assembly language and then heavily restricts memory and available instructions to an absolute minimum to create interesting puzzles. As such I don't find it appropriate for completely new programmers wanting to try coding, as it doesn't give a correct impression what programming really is like.I found the presentation very good, and I liked the story, the graphics, the sound design and the music very much. Not a single bug was encountered. I liked the addition of the magazines, their design and the fact that they contained world building fluff, even though I only read the API instructions and tutorials.

716490,1,2,76561197998939564,358,10,-1,16.1,"November 6, 2020","A programming puzzle game, where you play the role of a hacker writing assembly-level code for independent ""EXecution Agents"" (EXAs) to accomplish a specific task in a virtual world.The problem, however, is that the difficulty does not come from developing solutions to the puzzles, but from the limited toolset you are given to work with.  You'll spend more time fighting the interface and system that you will the puzzles.The number one biggest problem is that all the necessary information to do your programming - the language reference, instructions for interacting with the various devices you program, and so on - are NOT available to you in the game.  All of this necessary, literally essential, information is ONLY available through external PDF files.  The game actually tells you to print them out!  It knows they are necessary, but still doesn't make these guides available in-game.  In the 1980s, this sort of thing was understandable.  But in the 21st century, it is just terrible UI.The second problem is that the difficulty of each puzzle comes mostly from the limited program size (often 50 lines or less) and the limited number of registers you have to work with: 2.  Even the first digital computer ever made, the ENIAC from 1945, had 20 registers and could handle programs of thousands of lines.These limitations both frustrate the player and limit the games depth.  As it happens, the programming 'puzzles' quickly become dull near-repeats where the real challenge is figuring out which simple function that was standard in 1945 you'll need to re-invent (again) in order to proceed.A decent idea, but a swing and a miss on this one."

716490,0,0,76561198099171758,9,2,1,48.8,"July 29, 2020","First off Exapunks is a great game. If you like programming and enjoy puzzles, you should get it hands down.Now for the rest of the review. Coming into the game, the puzzles start out easy and keep increasing in difficulty until you are spending hours trying to understand why your complicated bot network with perfectly calibrated delays is not working. Overall the puzzles in this game are fun and challenging, but since there's not a hint system in the game it can be frustrating. This is especially true in the later levels when the artificial limitations of the EXA bots result in some truly hacky solutions (but some brilliant ones too).The one weak point is the story imo. The background around the phage didn't quite make sense to me and the dialogue options didn't amount to much. It would be really cool if it felt like you make a greater impact with your hacks in the story.However, the game has a lot of elements that make it unique outside of puzzles. The zines and the 90s hacker environment set up fits in really nicely. For the puzzle system alone this is well worth it."

In the tradition of Zactronics, he came up with another version of an assembly language, this time uses for a futuristic hacking simulation. They also once more stepped up their plot game and there is voiced monologue now. Also <3 the zine design."

However, it still comes with its fair share of interesting challenges, such as limited communication channels between the separate processors. This time the theme is based on the classic ""hacker"" trope. Contains an excellent campaign with increasingly difficult puzzles."
