2,2703,"If you like logic puzzles (often VERY difficult to parse at first) and you have at least a rudimentary understanding of basic computer programming and arithmetic, this game might be for you. If it's for you, it is TOTALLY FOR YOU. So you'll know the second you try it if you're going to love it."
3,2703,The number 1 reason I don't get enough sleep.
4,2703,Coding is COOL
5,2702,The best Zachtronics game so far! (if you have a programming background or want to learn it)
6,2702,yes
7,2702,"The gameplay is simple but fun, the difficulty challenging but not frustrating, the story is sometimes predictable but entertaining. One of the best games I have played this year"
8,2702,"This game takes the usual puzzle-solving fun of Zachtronics games, and marries it to a surprisingly compelling story and set of characters. Exapunks is incredibly charming, with the cool .pdf reference zine, the oldskool chat room dialogue, and more. The final arc of the story is fun and satisfying. Highly recommend this game, if you enjoy programming (or heck, if you want to dip your toes into programming, this could be a fun and challenging way to do it!)"
9,2700,
10,2699,It's really good folks
11,2697,Really great programming and logic game like all Zachtronics games. The late game is pretty heavy on recursion so my mind exploded.
12,2696,"Shenzhen IO v2. The new features such as replication keep the game fresh, and can lead to some pretty crazy solutions. Recommend if u are programmer"
13,2696,A good entry point to this company's games.
14,2694,"What a fantastic puzzle game. I really enjoyed reading zines and optimizing my solutions for speed. Each mission is different, the graphics are great and the game is very polished. Can't wait to play other Zachtronics games!"
15,2694,Perfect amount of well-written world-building packaged neatly between excellent gameplay. This is my favourite Zachtronics game so far (of the ones I have played). I love the atmosphere and reading the zines. The core gameplay feels similar to TIS-100 but with an improved code editing experience.
16,2694,"Zachtronics games are definitely in a league of their own.Well made, engaging and true puzzle games. I want to like this game and see the the story unfold but they do not make it easy. The puzzles require some solid thinking and learning the game programming.I know some people may easily breeze through these puzzles and just say, ""that was easy,"" but I am not one of those people. Trial and error and finishing one puzzle per session is about all I can muster at this point. I may need to take some online programming classes to get better or I could just do my day job instead of playing."
17,2693,Awesome game! I love this one almost as much as I love TIS-100.The final cutscene is something else... Creepier than the TIS-100 ending.
18,2693,This game taught me Assembly programming. And I enjoyed it.10/10 would debug code again.
19,2692,great
20,2692,"Pretty much everything about this game seems custom-built to tickle my personal sensibilities -- programming (and programming puzzles), ""hacking"", anti-authoritarianism, cyberpunk, the 90's, incidental IRC chats, arcade games -- so it's going to be hard for me to look at it objectively. Of course, if you like all those things too, you will find them gloriously realised in video game format, so go ahead and get it! But for everyone else, well, this is just a further refinement of the quintessential Zachtronics experience: write code to solve increasingly fiendish puzzles and, if you're so inclined, really stretch the limits in trying to optimise your solution in the face of the All-Consuming Histogram. It's a tried-and-tested formula for the company, and if you enjoyed any of the previous entries in the series, you're bound to enjoy this one. However, the amount of polish and charm that this particular game has makes it really stand out. Unlike TIS-100, which made me question halfway through the bonus campaign why the hell I wasn't just doing real programming instead (it would be easier!), playing Exapunks feels... cool. The writing and art does an effective job and the zines kick ass. Additionally, the barrier to entry is significantly lower than the two comparable ""coding"" titles of TIS-100 and Shenzhen I/O -- there's an actual tutorial! Also, the game will let you progress the story even if you have a terrible solution that overruns the size limit (you just won't get a leaderboard entry).This isn't to say that Exapunks is ""easy"", though; the later puzzles will take some work. Especially the bonus campaign ones. And man oh man there are some masochists over on the Steam Workshop, if you're looking for extra puzzles. The ceiling for the ""best"" solutions is really damn high for a lot of the puzzles, if you're looking to optimise. (Read the zines carefully! And maybe brush up on some rudimentary number theory...) I must however stress that none of this optimisation is required nor even really expected; it's just nice to have some depths to a game.In conclusion, Exapunks is a highly-polished assembly-language Zachtronics game dripping with attitude. If that sounds like your thing, well, join the rave!"
21,2691,"BY GOD THIS GAME IS GOOD, I usually make a stupid joke in reviews but I can't bring myself to make a mockery of this fantastic game. Buy this and delete all your other games cause you won't need them (except for SHENZHEN I/O of course)."
22,2691,Truly amazing game
23,2690,R T F M part 2
24,2689,"*hacker voice*I'm inAlso, the words LOOP, MARK, and LINK have lost all meaning.Amazing puzzle/programming game.One of Zachtronic's best works"
25,2689,"I love how this game gives you everything you need to finish the puzzles, but doesn't give you too much. You have to figure out what exactly you do have and how it translates to controls in the game.The challenges start out very easy and gradually become very difficult. If you like logic games, things that really make you think, this is a great game for you.If you're looking for easy, you'll get maybe 10 levels out of this game and then you'll end up stuck. Getting unstuck is the fun part. :)"
26,2689,love it
27,2689,"A puzzle game that poses problems that are solved with a pseudo-code language.   If you're looking to bend your head a little, this game is for you."
28,2688,Great game.  Super fun.  Not sure how easy it would be to pick up if I didn't have programming skills under my belt.  The atmosphere and puzzles had a great '90s vibe.
29,2688,"I think I liked TIS a little more (I haven't played Shenzhen), but this was still a lot of fun. This one makes me feel like going back and optimizing my solutions a lot more than many of the other zachtronics gamesOne very annoying thing about this game is that the problem statements are generally incomplete. Writing a solution that would cover every case permitted by the problem statement would usually be a lot more work and much less efficient than writing something that will work for all of the test cases. I wish the problem statements would be more explicit about what assumptions are safe to make rather than having the player to either guess and check or manually go through the test cases looking for exceptions (both of which are tedious)."
30,2688,It was really good. I documented the programming instructions in terms I understood and then was better able to complete the programming tasks. I kind of gave up when the levels got really hard but I think I might try again later when I'm less busy.
31,2688,"I ended up staying up until the wee hours playing on my first time launching it, so it must be pretty good."
32,2688,It's a fun little programmer puzzle indie game that reminds me why I really hated having two semesters of assembly in my CS degree.
33,2687,"I don't know why I delayed so long in buying this one. It may not be the perfect zachlike in terms of main mechanics (Opus Magnum is, and it's staying that way), but Exapunks definitely succeeds in something that I never really looked for in a zachlike: relation with story elements. Whereas in Opus Magnum you have only the solitaire game, puzzle editor, and puzzles, here you have hacker battles, solitaire, hack-match, a puzzle editor and of course the zines which are pretty entertaining. Buy this game."
34,2687,"EXAPUNKS features the most useful, intuitive, informative, and responsive debugging experience I've ever seen when programming.EXAPUNKS also features a language syntax which leads to the most obtuse, confusing, indecipherable, write-only code I've ever seen when programming. You're gonna need that debugger."
35,2686,"Are you a CS major, a cyberpunk aesthetic, or just want to get smart with writing code?This game might be for you.Exapunk is essentially assembly with a giant twist, where memory management is crazy and multi-threading becomes a nightmare. And then after you burned through every brain cell to get through a level, only to see your code efficiency being trashed on the leader-board.This is the Dark Souls of coding experience. 11/10 would recommend to all of my CS friends."
36,2686,"My favorite thing about this Zach game is the novel solutions you end up making because of how the EXAs fail when they run into problems. It reminds me of the Erlang/OTP way of programming. For example, maybe you need to explore a network and find something. Just send out EXAs in every direction. It doesn't matter if they end up running into a wall, because when they try moving in the direction of the wall they just die and clean up after themselves.I also think it's like, hilarious when the EXAs kill each other like. For one problem I made an EXA that keeps generating passwords for a locked device, and once it succeeds another EXA comes along and says ""hey, thanks for the password"" then kills it.The world is pretty neat. It's like an alternate version of 1997 that's weirdly more like 2021. I liked all the graphics and stuff.Difficulty wise it was pretty smooth, it gets pretty hard toward the end though, but nothing I got stuck on for more than a couple of hours.Story was kinda meh, but I'm not really playing for it. Music also got repetitive, I feel like there wasn't enough tracks in this one. The music that's there is good there just wasn't enough IMO.So, all in all a pretty solid entry with some unique mechanics that make it really fun when you get it."
37,2686,"A really cool coding game by Zachtronics. A must have for those who love to program in games. Very much like TIS-100 and SHENZHEN I/O, you also have to read a few manuals to play the game."
38,2686,love it
39,2686,"Hated assembler code in microcontroller studies, but love how this game uses it for puzzles. No idea how it feels to learn this game for non-coders, but I like this a lot."
40,2685,epic.
41,2685,"Okay, I did not expect to get so engrossed in this. I don't like programming. As much as I do it when I need to, I generally think of it as a chore, but something about visually seeing the code behavior in front of me, step by step and so on rather than waiting for it to upload, then apply, then restart, then creating the specific environment to trigger it, made it way more entertaining.There were actually a couple of times where I was surprised by the leaderboards to discover I had a better optimized solution than a high percentage of the playerbase, then others where I was shocked to discover I'd somehow overcomplicated it by a ton. Now, fair warning, the game wants you to either have a printer, or two monitors, but I played a good half of it on a laptop, a crappy one at that, tabbing back and forth to reference documentation. That's right, DOCUMENTATION. They call them 'Zines', but you're gonna appreciate having these to reference out of.You might find it short if you're some coding savant, but I recently saw a solution that someone said they'd worked on for a week. I got fifteen hours out of my first playthrough, with the bonus challenges. I did not like the wardialing puzzle, to the point I ended up with a 'JUMP ANGY' and 'JUMP MEGAANGY' in the code to express my frustration, both pieces of code were just different versions of killing off other EXA's for not delivering like some sort of sadistic supervisor. I expect to come back to this game a couple of times though to try to figure out better solutions to the puzzles I liked, and I did quite enjoy a majority of the story, even if I felt the end was a little lame in comparison."
42,2684,"A stellar programming game, where each level cleverly builds on the last"
43,2683,Best
44,2683,"I like the integration of story and puzzles. Later puzzles are quite hard.So you have to be okay with arbitrary limitations/programming being more difficult than in reality and you have to take some time to solve some of the more difficult puzzles. I'm sure there are solutions online if you get stuck.It's similar to TIS-100, but it's graphically more interesting and *tactile*. I'm more motivated to finish it."
45,2682,A little jog for the mind turned into a job.I love it.

Great PROBLEM SOLVING game (no clever puzzles, you must provide the clever yourself) with some engenious connundrums. Also a great game for anyone who's wondering what it's like to be a programmer, but can't figure out how to install scratch."
47,2679,"A wonderfully built puzzle game that uses assembly language and a very limited (two memory register) processor that can duplicate itself, similar to forking a processs.The difficulty scales quite well. I found the difficulty level scaled quite well as you pick up on programming patterns in the game, and the puzzles can often be a teaching experience for various kinds of common idioms you can use with the EXAs. Not terribly difficult for the most part if you have a computer science background, but quite fun."
48,2679,"A thinking person's game. Found myself pondering solutions even when I was away from the computer, and trying them out when I logged back on. Really enjoyable, and can be a challenge."
49,2677,"this is not fun, this is work (which i don't get payed for) disguised as a game , seeking a refund. This is the last time I will impulse purchase a game based on how it looks without watching a review."
50,2677,"A great programming game with some fun puzzles. I wish more puzzles were open before completing previous puzzles in the story, but I'm already 22 hours in and still haven't beat it."
51,2677,Brainy challenging fun
52,2677,"This is one of my favorite games. EXAPUNKS is both a series of coding puzzles using a basic coding language that anyone can learn quickly (no coding experience required) and a story line that progresses as you complete levels. The puzzles become more complex and force you to become more proficient with the coding language as the game progresses. One thing that makes this game like crack is the fact that your scores are compared to other players' scores. Completing a level is only the first step - you can spend a lot more time improving your code by optimizing for size or cycles (which usually require different solutions). I have 60 hours in this game and plan on spending a lot more. If you are an amateur programmer (like me), this game will likely make you better at writing and understanding iterative functions. Just buy it ok it's a great game :D"
53,2676,This game could be for you if you ever wondered what it would feel like to write real code in a cyberpunk setting. People have complained that the instructions come in a pdf. That actually increased the immersion for me. I don't want to hunt through a programming reference in-game.
54,2676,Excellent programming game. Having unlimited code memory on EXAs makes it a lot of fun to experiment and test wacky ideas that wouldn't be economical enough for TIS100.
55,2675,"If you like coding, check out this game!"
56,2673,Really good.
57,2673,"I recommend buying this game very much.though you will need to know to how to program in assembly, the game teaches you how though it is easier if you know already."
58,2672,Great programming-type puzzle game. Puzzles are creative and fun. It gets pretty challenging.
59,2672,"12 hours in and I can definitely say it's a compelling challenge, and I love the 90s aesthetic.  I'm a professional developer (well, reader of emails mostly grrrr!) so I can't speak to the difficulty curve if you don't know how to code, but I find it really fun to try to get the 'best' solution and am still dismayed when I see that I'm not the most efficient!I've not even got that far yet because I'm trying out different variations - but that's the fun, and that's how it is being a developer 'who cares'.For the non-devs I think there's definitely enough here to teach you how to approach the problems - and language you work with has enough functionality to teach you quite a lot about programming in general, to be honest - quite an achievement on the part of the designers."
60,2671,"Great social commentary, nice attempt at AR and a great final."

64,2670,"This is another ""write assembly language"" game from Zachtronics. I'd describe it as a slightly better and more polished version of Shenzhen I/O or TIS-100. I bought all of these games because I LOVED Opus Magnum and Spacechem, while Infinifactory is probably my favorite game of all time. I couldn't get into these assembly language games though. I won't go so far as to give this game a downvote, but I'll just say if you haven't played Infinifactory, that's a far better use of your gaming dollar, in my opinion."

It incorporates something not seen too often in games, this being external PDFs to help guide you through it. These add a bit of immersion to the game and put you in the mindset of the character. The all around feel of the game is smooth. I feel like I could have the soundtrack in the background to just relax to. This game pushes you to think like a programmer. It will just take a bit of patience and a little research on the fundamentals. It's not for everyone, but I recommend it for those they like cyberpunk and programming in general."

100,2663,"My favourite Zachtronic game and the first one I finished because I liked it so much.I found the puzzles challenging enough and was willing to go back to optimize them, though I do have some knowledge of programming (though not this low level).The story is interesting enough to give a motive to finish the puzzles. This game, like the other pseudo assembly language games from Zachtronics, also comes with a manual stylised as a hacker zine which is a really nice touch. Along with the IRC channel where you get reports on what your hacks have done creates a really interesting atmosphere and world. Oh, and not to forget the music which is brilliant.For extras, it comes with a solitaire game (I think all the games since SHENZHEN I/O have one except Opus Magnum but I haven't gotten far enough in that game to be so sure), a tile matching game and programmable gameboy-like device to distract you from doing the main puzzles.Recommended for anyone interested in programming or computing"
101,2663,"A nice little game where you compete against your steam friends (asynchronously) to make the most efficient piece of code to accomplish a weird task in some guy's fictional futuristic world. Uses only a small set of commands and a whopping two/three registers for storing numbers. And no, you do not use this to learn how to make software."

105,2662,Really fun programming gameplay if you're into that kinda thing. All documentation for the programming language and system architectures of the game is in the form of printable zines which you receive as part of the story which I thought was a fun touch.
106,2661,"the puzzles were great, really got the 'thinking outside the box' dealing with the very limited register set of the Exas, Makes me realize just how valuable the register space and memory capabilities of any current CPU/MCU.The story was interesting and engaging, and did a great job of tying together all the missions.the difficulty curve was good for the most part, only experienced 1 or 2 unexpected difficulty spikes (might have just been tired or needed to come up with a different methodology).If you play, I would actually recommend playing it over multiple days instead of cramming it into 2 like I did.  I think the story and experience may work out better."
107,2661,Awesome if you like programming puzzles
108,2661,"Really enjoyed the problem-solving aspects of the game, and the storyline is interesting too imo. Bonus levels might be a bit less enjoyable, based on personal experience + what some others are saying in the discussions, due to it being a bit more tedious than tricky. But I'll let you be the judge."
109,2661,"It's a game you'll only like if you like this kind of low level programming.But if you do, it's a lot of fun. Time just passes while I have ""one more try""."
110,2661,"I meant to just finish the tutorial missions, so I put on my headphones and... I stayed up for 4 hours after I needed to go to bed. Game is hella fun. Had some trouble with one of the early puzzles because I overlooked something easy. Pay attention to what causes registers to change values on nerv missions."
111,2661,"Zachtronics make progress from game to game (TIS-100, SHENZHEN I/O, EXAPUNKS).Starting from a graphical design that is absolutely flawless in EXAPUNKS and ending with the amount of different fun activities in the game.But one thing that bothers me is that developers aren't trying to minimize coding routine from level to level.The good thing is that I can select a code, copy, and paste it.But I would also like to have an in-game notepad with code snippets.Zachtronics also prefer to keep coding in their games at the abstraction level of assembler language that has its charm but it starts to annoy me repeating these rituals of coding loops and functions by using jumps.8/10"
112,2661,The manual has a ramen carbonara recipe that sounds disgusting but I kinda want to try it.
113,2661,Other than Screeps I haven't played any programming games before.  This is pretty awesome game tbh.
114,2660,I am probably too stupid for this game because it makes me angry and walk away but over the year or so I have owned it I have completed it with fairly good results and that.If you like TIS- 100 or Shenzen IO you will probably enjoy this a lot.
115,2660,better than watchdogs
116,2660,"+ Great programming puzzles in a limited ASM like language.+ The limitations of the language that you have to work around is what makes the tasks feel less like work and more like puzzles to be figured out.If you liked some of the feeling of hacknet but felt it lacked some actual programming, then this is the game for you. If you liked human resource machine but want something a tad more involved this is also a great game for you."
117,2660,more cyberpunk than cyberpunk 2077
118,2660,Addictive programming puzzles and some hilarious writing that somehow manages to tell a simple but compelling story. The extreme memory constraints the game utilizes are designed to give you just enough room to do anything if you start thinking outside the box and utilize the EXAs to their full potential.
119,2660,I recommend it to anyone who likes programming and is not afraid of a bit of a challange. The background story and the artwork give it flavor and make it a nice game not just coding.
120,2660,Good clean coding fun
121,2659,"As with TIS-100, this game is a blast and addictive. I found it especially fun to optimize my solutions and compare with the leader boards. Recommended if you like puzzles and tinkering."
122,2659,I am a programmer and a game dev.This is one of the most inspirational games I've played in a long time and has taken me back to the same wonder and excitement I felt for games when I was a teenager in the 90's.Thank you for that!Fantastic design - allows for such much flexibility.
123,2656,i like the idea of a separate manual but if it was optional that would be awesome.i seriously cant learn this lmao
124,2656,10/10 would use external storage as RAM again
125,2656,"I LOOOOVE that they put the tutorial outside of the game. You can see it digitally (second monitor/phone/tablet) or print it. Probably some of you find it annoying, and that's fair, but i think it's a cool way to dump all of the information about the game to the player without the player feeling like they're being handheld. If you're into programming/hacking game, a lot of typing too, this is a game you should try."
126,2656,fun stuffnegative reviews seem to be attention  angry that their job was so easily simplifiedlike farmers mad at Farm Simlike stealth archers mad at Skyrimlike border control mad at Papers Pleaselike ancient gods mad at Hadesdamn im good
127,2656,"Great game, the atmosphere feels very close to shenzhen i/o, good puzzles and damn interesting."
128,2655,"I'm only giving this a negative rating from the perspective of an experienced programmer. For noobs to programming, it would probably be enjoyable, but if you have experience, you'll find the coding too boring and there's not much else to the game. Only buy on sale, if you dare.Noobs, ignore this review because you'd probably have a lot more fun and sense of achievement."
129,2655,"I recommend Exapunks to anyone interested in programming and puzzle solving. However while this is a game in which you program, the programming is not equivalent to real programming. Exapunks contains a very low level programming language similar to assembly language and then heavily restricts memory and available instructions to an absolute minimum to create interesting puzzles. As such I don't find it appropriate for completely new programmers wanting to try coding, as it doesn't give a correct impression what programming really is like.I found the presentation very good, and I liked the story, the graphics, the sound design and the music very much. Not a single bug was encountered. I liked the addition of the magazines, their design and the fact that they contained world building fluff, even though I only read the API instructions and tutorials. I did not have the printed magazines but played the game with the magazines open as pdf files on a second monitor.Exapunks gave me a lot of value for my money. Thanks for the game, Zachtronics."
130,2655,Finally my programming degree pays off
131,2654,1337/10 would hack again
132,2653,"A programming puzzle game, where you play the role of a hacker writing assembly-level code for independent ""EXecution Agents"" (EXAs) to accomplish a specific task in a virtual world.The problem, however, is that the difficulty does not come from developing solutions to the puzzles, but from the limited toolset you are given to work with.  You'll spend more time fighting the interface and system that you will the puzzles.The number one biggest problem is that all the necessary information to do your programming - the language reference, instructions for interacting with the various devices you program, and so on - are NOT available to you in the game.  All of this necessary, literally essential, information is ONLY available through external PDF files.  The game actually tells you to print them out!  It knows they are necessary, but still doesn't make these guides available in-game.  In the 1980s, this sort of thing was understandable.  But in the 21st century, it is just terrible UI.The second problem is that the difficulty of each puzzle comes mostly from the limited program size (often 50 lines or less) and the limited number of registers you have to work with: 2.  Even the first digital computer ever made, the ENIAC from 1945, had 20 registers and could handle programs of thousands of lines.These limitations both frustrate the player and limit the games depth.  As it happens, the programming 'puzzles' quickly become dull near-repeats where the real challenge is figuring out which simple function that was standard in 1945 you'll need to re-invent (again) in order to proceed.A decent idea, but a swing and a miss on this one."
133,2653,"Another excellent programming puzzle game, as expected from Zachtronics. Natural evolution of SHENZHEN I/O and TIS-100. Now with a cool cyberpunk atmosphere and story. A little bit easier and more approachable, but as challenging as ever, if you're climbing the charts. The notable new feature here is PvP puzzles, which I haven't got a chance to dig into yet (Steam friends necessary)."
134,2653,Zachtroincs is always good and this is no exception. Accept no substitutes!
135,2652,The game is awesome because it encourages creativeness and engineering thinking.
136,2652,This is super fun if you enjoy programming puzzles.
137,2651,"Make sure to print the magazinesThis games kept me for a bit over a year and im only now close to beating everything it has to offer.It's hard, but  its rewarding."
138,2651,Cool story with classic zachtronics gameplay
139,2651,"Best ""puzzle-Hacking themed"" game Ever."
140,2651,"I don't know if assembly language was just way easier than the game-ified version presented here, or if we just literally never got problems as difficult as these at Rutgers Computer Science."
141,2650,Hope there is a sequal to Exapunks.
142,2650,  :      
143,2650,"This game is for hardcore puzzle lovers. Not just solving, but achieving better solutions can be surprisingly rewarding and deep. A great tutorial for programming in general and incredibly well paced for some really hard optimization problems. The Inclusion of statistics for the solutions allows you to not just compare your results with others, but also makes it an endeavor to improve what you believed to be the best solution you could concoct.Great soundtrack and aesthetic with an amazing a print-at-home zine that has the tutorial just like the old times. ExaPunks oozes personality and quality,. Greatly reccomended!"
144,2649,"Fantastic puzzles, really satisfying solutions, and surprisingly good plot."
145,2649,so good
146,2649,This game made me change careers at 33Been working as a back-end programmer in a bank for a year and a half now (yay Kotlin!)Thank you Zach! :)
147,2647,"Made my brain hurt for awhile on the later tasks. I also skipped every body section cause I seize up from stuff like that. Good ending, I enjoyed Exapunks."
148,2647,"Oh. Oh its asm has 4 letters now? I can divide and modulo now? Work with text? Welcome to Shenzhen i/o 2.0. Now your microcontrollers run around the board themselves and can copy themselves as well. The future is trully here. ...tho solitare is sh#ttier in this version, imo."
149,2647,"More puzzle than hacker game. You have to program using pseudo-assembler code to do things. Not as hard as it sounds!There we have: - Good learning curve. Start small, get great. - Encourages RTFM. In missions, you are told ""what"" to do, not ""how"" to do it. Always available (and printable) manual give you all the basics you need to build your solution on. - Great soundtrack. - Few optional minigames. - Storyline, it exists and binds events together. Not a great one (leaves too many dangling ends), but I suppose it is not required. - Leaderboards. Got a working solution, witty you? Now watch yourself being in last 10% in cycle count and do it better. You surely don't have to to progress in game, but it is nevertheless encouraging."
150,2647,This game scratches a particular horrible itch. It's hard to find good coding games. Escalates in difficulty in a satisfying way.
151,2646,i like it
152,2645,Loved this game. Coding up little agents to talk to each other in order to solve problems.
153,2645,i suck too much to give a in depth review so im just gonna say its good
154,2645,"This is an excellent and challenging programming game that gets deep into programming.  The challenge comes partly from managing a small number of registers for each process, and leveraging parallel processing and signals to increase your resources.  It's well put together to gradually introduce new concepts and has an interesting story/theme."
155,2644,Awesome game. Will give you some new ideas regarding programming.Also great art.
156,2644,i played it for 127 hours so its probably good
157,2644,"Never have I been so gloriously frustrated by a game and also felt like it was genuinely giving me a glimpse into another technical skill and world.  Exapunks has literally caused me to look differently at everything from games to work process and in between.  Its immensely satisfying to see a piece of code run well and occasionally hilarious to see a piece of code work, but run as bad as possible.  Highly recommend to anyone.  Those who love puzzles, those who like games or those who just want to briefly feel what an impressive feat it is to be a genuine coder."
158,2643,Highly recommended if you like the other games by Zachtronics.

160,2642,Amazing soundtrack; wicked aesthetic; hilarious theme. Loving how much the problems tickle my brain.
161,2642,"Let it bend your brain.Exapunks is not easy, but GOD is it rewarding. Half of the fun is interacting with a community of players and the zines themselves. I'm running solutions in my dreams at night now.If you are as much of a comp science novice as I am, it may be a little heady. The tutorials almost force you to find other players for suggestions. It sounds like a pain, but it starts to blur the lines between the game and reality, which is quite a rewarding feeling once you start coming up with solutions built by the knowledge you've gained from earlier puzzles. Have fun. Swear at the screen. Curse and love your little robots."
162,2642,"masterpiece from famouse game lab zachtronics. Perfectly crafted story line, pazzles and game play."
163,2642,I used to have to do labs and program in assembly and it sucked.Funny how you can put the same activity in a game and make it fun.Recommended unless i find there are interrupts later in the game.
164,2641,A solid programming puzzler. Right up there with the rest of Zachtronics' games.
165,2641,"If you like programming in assembly language, but wish it were both simpler and more cyberpunk, look no further. Hexadecimal? Pointers? Bitshifting? Nowhere to be found! Retro-future hacker aesthetic? Yes and then some!Be warned though, while this is a great programming game, it isn't a great game to learn programming. The difficulty curve is steep. The complexity of the puzzles quickly becomes intimidating. The top 10% solutions will feel impossibly far away, let alone the top 1%. Still, it is fantastically addictive and presents a wide variety of programming challenges for the dedicated player. Highly recommend"
166,2641,Assembler is my University love. All Hail the King :)
167,2640,The most accessible of Zachtronics full programming games so far
168,2639,A great programming game with a good range of interesting and thematic puzzles.
169,2639,I like puzzle games and this has been an entertaining puzzle game. I haven't completed it yet but I like how the challenge has ramped up.
170,2639,Still in the beginning bits. Liking it so far
171,2638,"First off Exapunks is a great game. If you like programming and enjoy puzzles, you should get it hands down.Now for the rest of the review. Coming into the game, the puzzles start out easy and keep increasing in difficulty until you are spending hours trying to understand why your complicated bot network with perfectly calibrated delays is not working. Overall the puzzles in this game are fun and challenging, but since there's not a hint system in the game it can be frustrating. This is especially true in the later levels when the artificial limitations of the EXA bots result in some truly hacky solutions (but some brilliant ones too).The one weak point is the story imo. The background around the phage didn't quite make sense to me and the dialogue options didn't amount to much. It would be really cool if it felt like you make a greater impact with your hacks in the story.However, the game has a lot of elements that make it unique outside of puzzles. The zines and the 90s hacker environment set up fits in really nicely. For the puzzle system alone this is well worth it."
172,2637,"Great puzzle game. In the tradition of Zactronics, he came up with another version of an assembly language, this time uses for a futuristic hacking simulation. They also once more stepped up their plot game and there is voiced monologue now. Also <3 the zine design."
173,2637,nice
174,2637,Somebody please help me finish the last level
175,2637,Excellent game. Challenging puzzles and entertaining backstory.
176,2637,"On difficulty, Exapunks feels easier than TSI and Shenzhen, because there is no limitations to code length."
177,2637,Another wonderful entry in the series
178,2637,Zachtronics did not disappoint.This game is really worth the cost.The manual is a little printer-unfriendly though.
179,2636,"If you enjoy computer programming and wish someone would make a game based around the creative thinking involved in it, you should play this game. If you like puzzle games that require you think and allow you to make creative solutions to your problems, you should play this game.Exapunks is awesome sauce weaponized and easily injectable into your veins."

But maybe are not ready to get down and dirty with a real programming language yet. All while playing a fun game with an interesting story at the same time. :)
221,2633,a true hacking game
222,2632,"Another fun programming game from Zachtronics. Difficulty-wise it sits somewhere between TIS-100 and Shenzen I/O I think, but I've not completed this yet. Generally speaking pretty accessible."
223,2632,Please optimize responsibly
224,2631,like TIS-100 without the $&#*$ annoying code limits
225,2631,"Very fun game, problems range from easy to insanely hard with a few extra modes to play here and there. The problem solving is fun and once you've completed your problem you get to see a histogram to gauge how ""well"" you performed against other people online. Then it is up to you to optimize your solutions in three categories (cycles, size, activity) so there is definately some replayablitly. Oh and the game includes a retroesque handheld console that you can write games for!Want friends on your histograms? Add me :)"
226,2631,If you like Programming this is and will be the Perfect game for you with it`s puzzles and programming language that is Hard but fast to learn. the Developers are still fixing issues and this game can and is actualy compatitiv with it`s own competition that is happening at some time. I give the game a Rating of 9 out of 10 because I personaly miss a internal book that you can open like on the under left or right that you can actualy look up the real commands of it and not some commands that you thing they are real but aren`t which makes it kinda frustrating BUT still makes fun when you make it.

228,2630,Excellent game. EXAPUNKS makes a game out of problem solving and coding.
229,2630,"Excellently crafted puzzles, and a great atmosphere."
230,2630,"Wonderful game, possibly my favourite Zachtronics game of all time. If you like TIS-100, you'll love this, it's of the same calibre, perhaps even a bit better. While I've only played 19 hours, it's been an incredibly engaging 19 hours, and I suspect I'll double that.Great way to get into assembly coding and explore some other real world concepts (repl is just like fork,) and while the hardware environments are always contrived and tight, it's a wonderful way to experience some nostalgia (for those of us that are as old as me) and have some fun with something that looks like assembly for a super simple little bit of hardware."
231,2630,Similar to TIS-100 but easier and with more polish. Personnally I still prefer TIS-100 but I can understand why exapunk would have more appeal.
232,2629,"I've played most of zach's games, and they're all pretty good. Honestly, I'd play them more if I didn't already have a real job as a programmer. My favorite is Opus Magnum, but this is my next favorite. It's great fun to spawn little goofy robots to prance around the local bank's network, spitting $20 bills at various ATMs around the city. A lot of zach's other games are lacking in eye candy, but this one improves on that particular criticism quite a bit. Two thumbs up. Now, if we can just get zach to add in some VI bindings..."
233,2629,"I had fun being in the narrative of EXAPUNKS. I enjoyed the programming a lot, it's my jam, and there's something comforting in the puzzle experience knowing that I can solve any problem presented within a level. However, the thing kept bringing me back to play one more level or to solve a puzzle I was having trouble with were the kinetic novel scenes (not sure if this is the correct term, but I'll roll with it). I like the 90's hacker fantasy, and appreciate what this game evokes of that experience, because writing the programs helped me feel much closer to the narrative experience than TIS-100. For me, that I was able to identify with and inhabit the main character Moss made me excited for future Zachtronics titles and to see how narrative and mechanics work together to create an experience similar to what I've heard people say about the game Hades.So many other reviews have talked about the programming aspects of this game, so I don't feel the need to cover that in detail, because they have done a better job than I will. What I can add is when I showed this game to a friend they said it looked like homework, and if that's not the game you want maybe skip this one."
234,2629,If you like Zachtronics (and I do) this is one of the really good ones. Absolutely recommend!
235,2628,"Makes me (an idiot) feel smart.A novel outside-of-game approach to tutorials, combined with nice clear graphics, an interesting story, and a ripping soundtrack, all make for a sublime experience."
236,2628,"A decent Zachtronics game, but much more style over substance compared to his other titles. It seems like there's a lot of optimization you could do at first glance, but the puzzles are so simple you'll never make a bad solution that really needs optimizing. Even getting to the solution never really requires any serious thought. It's possible that I'm really early into the game and it gets harder later, but I doubt it.From a story perspective I'm not even sure you'd call what you do in this game hacking. No one in this universe has any authentication on their servers, meaning you're essentially coding straight into the target network from your home computer, and this is untraceable somehow. It's a very special type of dystopia when anyone can just plug into a bank's network and make all of their ATMs start spitting out all their money.What this game is really missing is an exploration element. Scouring the web for the addresses of servers, exploring said servers without being caught by the defenses, and so on seems like what they were going for here. As it is though you're really just plugging into someone's toaster and hitting the on button, knowing their address and the entirety of their server from the get-go.6/10, play it if you like both the theme and the programming"
237,2628,Challenging but rewarding
238,2627,"Solid Zachtronics game, albeit not one of my favorites due to the focus on textual programming and restrictive memory registers. I much prefer the more visual and symbol-based style of SpaceChem, Infinifactory, and Opus Magnum."
239,2627,As always Zachtronics provides a wonderfully complex but accessible puzzler game that really test your abilities to break down and solve problems. The theme is on point and the Zine concept is absolutely stellar. Definitely recommend to puzzle fans and even to some people that enjoy the challenge of coding.
240,2627,"What a great game. If you like solving problems this game is for you. Even if you are not a programmer, the zines will teach you everything you need to know. If you are a programmer, you're still in for a real treat -- I've been a developer for a decade and this game is still very challenging near the end. Be prepared to go a whole session without solving a single problem, and be sure to think outside the box. This game is about a time when programming wasn't about coming up with the most elegant and cleans solution -- but about coming up with any solution, even if you have to be hacky and ugly about it. Truly worth every penny.My only complaint is that there is no zine available in-game. I don't have a printer, so I had to read the zine on my computer, and tabbing in and out of the program to the PDF was annoying. But you don't have to do that very often at all, so it's not a big deal."
241,2627,gud game
242,2626,Fun game for programming after I'm done programming for work.
243,2626,"A really nice and playful way to not let assembly skills rust.I especially like the 90's hacker flaireit's easier than Human resource machine, and probably less educational but also more interesting and just feels like actually playing a game"
244,2626,Very similar to TIS-100 but with way fewer limits. I love them both.
245,2625,"This is an absolutely fantastic programming puzzle game. The theme is great and the story is engaging. The puzzles are pretty varied and you feel like a master programmer when you're able to figure out the solution. This game is very fun and rewarding, and 100% worth the price. I'd recommend it to everyone who likes programming and wants a fun puzzle game."
246,2625,"This game is amazing.  I have the entire Zachtronics collection, and this is the first one that I have beat all the way through.  This game hooked me from the start, and even through I got frustrated at times, and I had to put it down for a day, i was able to pick it back up, and power through it.  this game is hard! the missions start out simple, and ramp up at a pretty good pace. If you like other Zachtronics games, this is an amazing addition, and you should totally get it."
247,2625,"This tickles the same part of my brain that enjoyed TIS-100, but manages to avoid triggering most of the pain centers that were ALSO activated by TIS-100. I'm finally getting the hang of how to break down a problem so a swarm of EXAs can solve it. Plus I love the retro-future setting!"
248,2625,"I cannot recommend this game highly enough.If you enjoy logic puzzles and aren't daunted by typing, this is a game for you.You need to take some very simple concepts and use them in nearly endless ways to solve problems, many of which are a nod to the real history of hacking.Because the simple set of tools you're given can be combined into near-endlessly complex solutions, you're not constrained to one particular approach.Often a level late in the game forced me to innovate, and presented better solutions to earlier puzzles.So good I sunk over a hundred hours into it in less than a fortnight, around a full-time job."
249,2625,"Of the Zachtronics Coding games (TIS-1000, Shenzen I/O, and This), I found this one the best. Compared to the others, it combines a good story / aesthetic (which I feel TIS-1000 had, and Shenzen I/O lacked, at least for me for me), and a little more open-endedness to the format which makes the puzzles more interesting, and less frustrating (both of the others ran into that for me, because of the length constraints. This also may be a personal thing - I may just be a verbose programmer, but its all opinions)So all in all, I would reccomend this one over the other two if you want to try a Zachtronics Code game."
250,2624,I'm not Red.
251,2624,"Great mechanics, not too hard to pass the levels but optimization can be very tricky. Could use more levels."
252,2624,"great game, fun atmosphere, challenging gameplay, very intelligent"
253,2623,"So, I'm not good at Zachtronics games. I usually give up around between 1/3 to 1/2 way into any given Zachtronics game. But this one just was so much fun with all the flavour and story I decided to work my way through it. And man, was it rewarding. Actually finished it now (with some help from reddit for the last puzzle admittedly), but feelsgoodman.If you're interested in trying out a Zachtronics game, I'd definitely recommend this one, since it has a cool Story/flavour around it unlike the other ones I tried (T-100 and Shenzen). And the puzzles are really fun in regards that you're actually feeling like you're manipulating a real world entitiy and then see the consequences of it to some extent, which feels very rewarding and definitely kept me going along the way.Very happy with this game :)"
254,2623,"If you got a lot of time on your hands, and aren't satisfied by p0wning 12 years olds with your computer on CoD mobile, this might be the game for you. Although it can be quite hard and lonely sometimes, it'll make you very happy everytime you come up with a solution that works."
255,2623,The best hacking/programming game I've playedIf you like TIS-100 you'll love EXAPUNKS. I also enjoyed the story very much
256,2623,"Very satisfying game, would recommend."
257,2623,I've never felt so smart as after beating this game. I am no programmer and the game did a really great job of easing me into it's depths with slowly increasing complexity and the awesomely done zines.
258,2622,"It is really awesome! Gives you an ultra-simple assembly language with mobile agents capabilities, and lets you solve puzzles. Its so awesome that I'll gently try to convince my stepson with force to peel of  Fortnite and give it a go."
259,2622,10/10 recommend this to all my programmer and computer enthusiast people. It's fun and a pretty good model to learn programming concepts with.
260,2622,I liked this game a lot. I had a very limited amount of programming experience but it didn't hinder me at all. Coding your little bots is interesting due to the extremely limited number of things they can do. Seemingly simple tasks can require clever solutions and it makes you feel like a genius when it all works. I beat the game and the story was well done too.
261,2621,"This game is my default example when I tell people that programming games can be good. I think that speaks for itself. If it doesn't: the soundtrack, sound design, language documentation, level-specific art themes, everything just oozes style. In conjunction with that the Axiom language is so fun and rememberable that I sometimes find myself programming solutions for other, unrelated problems in it."
262,2621,quite challenging & rewarding with a good story
263,2621,"This game plays like a much less frustrating TIS-100. You get more options for dealing with data that make this game much superior in my opinion. The types of tasks are more varied as well, so it feels like you're actually accomplishing something.By no means does that make this game easy: the tasks end up being incredibly complex due to the increased features in the game. I'm still trying to make my way through the main campaign.However, the art and music are icing on top of a great fake assembly programming game."
264,2621,"The best example I've played from this genre! Still, you kind of need to be the kind of person who enjoys writing assembly code."
265,2620,"If this game looks like anything you might be interested in, definitely pick it up. Not only is it a lot of fun, it will teach you useful real-world programming concepts.EXAPUNKS is my favorite Zachtronics game so far. Out of the 3 assembly-based ones - TIS-100, Shenzen I/O, and this - I suggest getting this one first. It's the easiest and most forgiving of all of them, and has the widest variety in its levels. Unlike the gimmicky levels in Shenzhen, the story behind each level in EXAPUNKS actually informs the level's design in interesting and unique ways.Just getting through the levels in EXAPUNKS is a breeze. Unlike in TIS and Shenzhen, you have a large and flexible instruction set to work with, RAM in the form of files, two fully general-purpose registers, as many EXAs as you need, and no limits on instruction counts (except if you want to get on the leaderboards).The real fun, as usual, is in optimization. And boy, is this game satisfying to optimize. Because of the relatively lax restrictions on instruction and EXA counts, there are huge opportunities for loop unrolling, clever timing tricks, and parallelism limited only by fundamental bandwidth limits and your ability to conduct your army of EXAs in an intricate dance. Optimizing these solutions feels like real engineering, moreso than in other Zachtronics games. Certainly it's the most familiar to me as a programmer.The complementary solitaire is a nice addition as usual, and the other minigame seems nice although it's not my type of game. However, the hacker battles feel like maybe they should've been scrapped. They just don't really work how I think they were meant to - it's too easy to cheese a solution to any single person's AI in particular, and I think there's a reason pretty much nobody bothered coming back to these. Maybe if the game made you submit the same AI against all available opponents, instead of being able to cheese each one individually, it would have been a fun part of the game. Oh well, there's more than enough of the normal levels to go around."
266,2620,"This is my new favorite programming puzzle game. Lots of fun and educational too. Really all the Zachtronics games are awesome. This one is a little similar to Shenzen I/O, but better."
267,2620,It's from Zachtronics. They never disappoint. Another great coding/assembler game.
268,2619,WARNING: Highly addictive!
269,2619,"If your idea of a fun final boss fight is implementing bubble sort (or any other sorting) using assembly code with only two registers, one of which is overwritten with the result of your comparison, this is the game for you.If you're not ready for quite that level of challenge, there's a very very moderate difficulty curve up to that point. And if you are far beyond that level of challenge, try to do it in fewer cycles, or with less code, than others."
270,2619,gg
271,2619,Awesome.
272,2619,One of the best games I have ever played
273,2619,A fun way to introduce someone to assembly programming.
274,2619,Great puzzler with cyberpunk vibes.
275,2619,"Great game, good for getting into programming/coding or for people already into it wanting a gamey experience"
276,2618,Great game with fun puzzles. Hard but not unfair if you have prior programming experience.
277,2618,Took a break from programming homework to do programming homework.  Great game.
278,2618,A great introduction to programming with assembly with an intriguing story.And you'll probably tear your hair out until you beat your friends scores.
279,2618,"Great puzzle game, as I've come to expect from Zachtronics. I haven't finished it yet, but I've enjoyed it immensely so far. The puzzles are very challenging, sometimes positively daunting at first glance, but after hacking away at them for a while it clicks. :)Only thing really missing is an in-game viewer for the PDFs that can be brought up from anywhere for quick reference. Alt-tabbing feels needlessly clunky, and printing them just isn't my jam. I get what they were going for, and I like it in theory  just turns out I didn't really like it in practice."
280,2618,Do you like puzzlers?  Do you like writing microcode?  This game is for you.
281,2618,Great game! It makes you feel productive while still having fun.
282,2618,A very fun programming game that makes you feel like a genius when you finally crack the solution. I don't think I will ever beat the game but the missions that I have managed to do were very enjoyable. If you are interested in learning some programming then its pretty fun! Keep in mind that it can be difficult if you aren't a programmer.
283,2618,I love this game!!
284,2618,brilliant
285,2618,EXAPUNKS is very immersive. I really enjoyed being able to print out physical zines to read along with while playing the game. It really adds an extra layer to the experience.
286,2618,"Excellent. Best hacking game I've ever played, the concept is simple but the puzzles get incredibly complicated. I've gotten completely addicted."
287,2617,"good puzzle game - great soundtrack, kickass manual"
288,2617,"Not much to say about this that I didn't say about Shenzhen I/O. If you liked that, you'll probably like this. If you don't know what I'm talking about, make sure you know what you're getting into -- this is a game that involves actual programming.A couple of big new ideas here: Your EXAs, unlike microcontrollers in Shenzhen or CPUs in TIS-100, can move between hosts, and they can replicate, and there's some file manipulation. That all feels appropriate for a game themed around hacking.A more esoteric bit: Custom puzzles are scripted in JavaScript, instead of Lua, and it seems to be a reasonably modern JS. They're more powerful, too -- in Shenzhen, your Lua script had to output a static test case; here, your script can dynamically interact with the player's solution.I learned my lesson from Opus Magnum, and I have no desire to 100% the achievements -- maybe I'll eventually finish all the Solitaire games, but the hacker competitions and the twitch match/3 games both feel out of place and are not things I want to spend days trying to get a higher score in. The one thing that bugs me: My solution to the final level of the bonus campaign is just over the instruction limit to count on the leaderboards. But, thankfully, that's the only penalty."
289,2617,Pretty fun with a low level programming feel
290,2617,On par with Portal in terms of how good of a game this is
291,2617,"I should mention that if you are code averse or have no interest in learning assembly language this game may not be for you. The game itself is set in a 90's retro-futuristic cyberpunk environment where you are a retired hacker afflicted with a terminal illness, the treatment for which is trapped behind an insurmountable paywall in typical dystopian fashion. Under the stress of these conditions you are forced to come back out of retirement and re-learn your trade. The story is told through short, somewhat static, dialogue scenes. You can easily skip these if you really don't care. The core of the gameplay is in the coding puzzles, tasks you must complete to earn money for your treatment. I have not completed the storyline yet but it is very linear so far though still interesting. This game is actually a very cleverly disguised code training module. At no point during my play-through did it actually feel like work; if you have experience working in assembly then you probably understand that this is an outstanding achievement. The language used by this game is actually very similar to ARM cortex assembly languages in execution. If you have prior programming experience in higher level languages, this game provides an interesting perspective for working only a few levels above machine op-codes. There are no for or while loops and you must manage your limited number of registers carefully. Each puzzle can be solved in multiple ways, and the game grades your solution on the conditions of how many clock cycles used, the length of your code is, and the number of link actions used.If you are planning on taking an EE course in microprocessors in the near future I highly recommend playing through this game beforehand, I wish I had known about it! It will be much more helpful than that chegg subscription you were probably considering. Almost everything about the gameplay is a direct analogue to the coding portions of that type of class all the way down to the presentation of the puzzle goals and reading the included documentation to learn the syntax, just much more fun with an interesting aesthetic and a light story. I will definitely be checking out the other games from Zachtronics after I finish this one."
292,2616,i am a student.i love programming.This game is little hard but very interesting.
293,2616,"It's like being a hacker like in that movie, Hackers."
294,2616,Best programming game ever.
295,2616,Really makes you think like a programmer!It makes you feel really stupid for a long time but when you crack the puzzle you feel like a genuine genius!
296,2616,Learn to code. base64 WW91J3JlIHByZXR0eSBnb29kLCBzbmFrdSEK
297,2615,Basically just programming
298,2614,"Fun game with an interesting storyline. The puzzles can be quite challenging as you progress through the game, and the scoring system increases replayability, inviting you to keep trying until you've matched other people's shortest / fastest programs."
299,2613,is good
300,2613,If this is your idea of fun then I can relate. I think you have to either love or hate this game. I love it.
301,2613,"Zachtronics hasn't disappointed me yet, and this game is no exception"
302,2612,Best programming game I've ever played
303,2612,"I've always enjoyed Zachtronics games in concept, but this is the first one to really grab me and refuse to let go. The added story and context to the puzzles is fantastic, and it is challenging without being overwhelming."
304,2611,More of the usual from Zachtronics. Great stuff.
305,2611,"Great programming puzzle game with an interesting agnet concept. While the story is somewhat clichee, the actual game is somewhat challenging and the competitive aspect known from previous Zachtronics games creates a replay value.A single playthrough with bonus levels took me ~25h"
306,2609,"Another glorious iteration of machine code: the game. If you've enjoyed any of the other games from Zachtronics, this one is a definite buy. I would say that you don't necessarily have to be a programmer (aspiring or otherwise) to have fun with it, provided you do enjoy solving puzzles. The language used is well documented, the art fits the cheesy early hacker aesthetic to a t, and the story is engaging enough to make you want to bang your head on your desk figuring out the next solution. In the cons column, if you aren't a fan of reading the manual this is not a game for you. Reading the documentation is necessary, and referencing it regularly will be the only way to figure out some solutions. I'd recommend printing it out if you're able, as having a desk reference is infinitely better than alt tabbing out to scroll through a pdf.TL;DR: Buy the game, RTFM, don't get discouraged by the tougher segments."
307,2609,"Another masterpiece from Zachtronics! I hope these guys are filthy rich by now, their track record is stellar! The puzzles - basically beginner-level assembly programming - are awesome (carefully designed, challenging, but fair) and they are wrapped in an enjoyable cyberpunk story, which doesn't feel like filler content."
308,2609,"EXAPUNKS - the game that keeps you thinking.How the heck did they DO that???Much like Zachtronic's other games, it's a game based on sticking simple bits together to do some zany stuff that you wouldn't ordinarily think could be done so simply. I'm only seven hours into this game, but I'm already scratching my head as to how people manage to get such tiny results for CPU use or block count. If I can work out a solution, often it's a ""It'll get stuff done"", but not  a compact nor a fast solution. I'm enjoying the fact that this game has more of a story wrapped around the simple tasks too. That breaks the immersion factor somewhat, but it's a nice break.Get this if you're interested in puzzles that make you scratch your head for a while."
309,2609,"As a programmer, Zachtronics's previous two assembly programming games felt like work (TIS-100 about halfway through; SHENZHEN I/O almost immediately, but that's in keeping with the theme of the game).  Unlike those two, EXAPUNKS does not feel like work.  It held my interest until the end of the main campaign, and I may play the bonus missions too.  The tasks get more complex as the game progresses, though they never felt especially challenging (given I've some programming experience)."
310,2609,damn great game!
311,2609,Not as good as Shenzhen I/O but still pretty nice
312,2609,"Exapunks is perfect for days where I'm in the mood to program, but too burnt out to work on an actual project. Solving small problems and trying to shave cycles off your best score is really fun. It accurately captures the spirit of retrocomputing without requiring the equipment and free time. I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys that ""A-Ha!"" moment that comes when a program you wrote finally runs the way you expected it to."
313,2609,"This is the third zachtronics game that I've completed, the others being infinifactory and opus magnum. I tried TIS-100 but couldn't get very far. It's hard to quantify which one was my favorite, I really love all three of these games. In terms of difficulty, I'm inclined to say that opus magnum < exapunks < infinifactory, although that might just be because I played infinifactory first and was pretty inexperienced with this type of game at the time. Infinifactory took me 65ish hours to 100%, opus magnum took 20ish to beat the main story, exapunks took 25 to beat the main story.I write all this in case anyone else has played some other zachtronics games and are wondering where I think this one lies. The puzzles in this game are coding puzzles, which is intimidating for someone like me who has never coded anything in their life. However, nearly all the instructions are laid out very well in the documents you receive at the start of the game. I was able to comfortably complete every level in the main story aside from one (where I didn't know how the swizzle command worked), and only three were above the soft instruction limit.To anyone who knows they like zachtronics games or just challenging puzzles in general, this game is absolutely worth playing. It has a surprisingly interesting story and looks and sounds amazing. It also does a very good job at making you feel incredibly smart for figuring out some of the puzzles (as do most zachtronics games)."
314,2608,"Solidly recommended. Has a nice balance between accessibility and depth. More accessible than Shenzhen I/O I think. More accessible than Shenzhen I/O I think. The solutions to puzzles can often be quite elegant, but the solution is driven entirely by the player. It is a great game."
315,2608,Makes you feel like a 90's hackerman
316,2608,"A nice little programming game, writing programs in simple assembly executing in a constrained parallel environment"
317,2608,Even the z80 had more registers. :)  But that would make it too easy.  This game is so much fun.  Ok it's 4am time for sleep.
318,2608,"TLDR: buy it.I HIGHLY recommend this game to anyone who is a programmer at any level of proficiency. The thing here is basically working with great constraints, e.g. you barely get variables to work with, and yet to pack a small code. It feels like a mixture of syntax and automata design and it is very fun.When you complete the task you will see the leaderboards displaying other people's stats regarding lines of code, cycles used, etc, in their solutions. So the puzzles are manifold challenges.For non-programmers, I think it IS possible to do this as well. I'm just some random CPP noob, and I'm having some difficulty but moving forward. I'd say TRY it, because this is so different to other games, it is really an amazing genre on its own. I never played anything like this before. You might end up loving to code stuff.Some minor things to comment: (a) I like the main menu display music, but the puzzles have distracting music (and stock volume is so LOUD), I turn off music altogether (maybe we could keep the same generic music all along or choose between soundtracks). (b) There SHOULD be a way to consult the zine inside the game, like a pop up, because minimazing the app to read the pdf is a bit annoying. (c) The atmosphere is really 90s, but the story-telling can be a bit silly (tho since I'm at the 10th puzzle, I'm not sure if all that info plays some role further down the game.) (d) Why I can't apply any options, like windowed game?? This would help with the music and zine issues.Finally, a suggestion would be to make a mod where players can build puzzles and challenge the community. That's a perfect game to do something like this.Conclusion: Highly satisfied, 9/10."
319,2608,"It challenges the user to write nice small programs. Easy language, simple structure of the EXA (these are the machines who execute the code). Better than TIS-100."
320,2608,"Standard disclaimer: Play clock is inaccurate, as it doesn't count offline time.In BriefAnother incredibly detailed puzzle game from Zachtronics. Adopts a more in-depth, code-level approach to the process problem solving found in games like SpaceChem. Also serves as a great introduction to assembly language programming. Can be frustrating due to increasingly complex puzzles, steep learning curve, locked-linear mission list, and thin documentation. Funky cyberpunk soundtrack is on point. Extensive typing is a requirement. Recommended for persons willing to invest the work in building necessary skills; not recommended for impatient gamers or those who only want graphical interfaces. Want to Live the Cyberpunk Lifestyle?You ever been reading a cyberpunk novel like Snow Crash or watching one of those dystopian films like Johnny Mnemonic and find yourself thinking ""I don't know why they call that a dystopia. Sure, it's a dump, but I think I'd do fine!"" Well, good news: now you can prove it. EXAPUNKS takes place in one of those landfill futures: 1997. But the way dystopian films of the '80s thought it would be, not the acutal 1997 when mighty boybands roamed the Earth and cell phones still weighed a pound. You're dumped into this land of cyberpunk misery, given a vaguely-named terminal disease (The Phage), and you get your chance to prove your cyberpunk fantasies by being the unstoppable cyberguru you know you could be. Except for one thing: you can't.Earn Your GreatnessWell, not at first, anyway. This is a game with a steep learning curve because you're actually learning assembly programming. Really! EXAPUNKS is a game where you create and program little digital agents (EXAs) using actual assembly language programming. Each mission in the game tasks you with completing certain objectives. To do so, you need to code processes into EXAs to perform a variety of functions - manipulating and moving data, affecting systems, even full-on EXA-to-EXA combat (sorta). The catch is that you're not some Hollywood programmer; you need to write code here.Where games like SpaceChem have you graphically map out what your processes do, EXAPUNKS approaches the concept from the other direction, forgoing visuals for code. This could make the game less friendly and approachable. Watching code run really doesn't do it for many people, because it's, well, dull. It's also sometimes difficult to envision what's actually happening. So, Zachtronics added a graphical representation of everything that goes on, letting you watch a visual version of your code working in its environment and making the game much more approachable, but no less difficult.The Learning CliffEXAPUNKS is, much like 688(I) Hunter/Killer, a game that has a lot for players to learn and is not a fan of hand-holding. EXAPUNKS starts you out slow enough with simple, basic tasks, then works you up to more complex work. The game doesn't really hold you back, allowing you to apply complex concepts as soon as you're comfortable with them (and know them), so you can apply the full power of your coding creativity. However, you need to learn what to do, because this ain't Hollywood, and EXAs don't speak a human language. The game teaches you your coding through in-universe documentation in the form of a series of short magazines. These introduce you to coding vocabulary, operation, and concepts, as well as to more game-specific concepts that will be necessary to complete missions. Mostly. The documentation is pretty bare-bones, so you will need to apply a lot of creative problem solving and experimentation in order to succeed and, in some cases, you're going to be resorting to trial-and-error to figure out just how to make something work. This is a game for patient, detail-oriented gamers. Immediate-gratification, easily frustrated players will probably find EXAPUNKs rage-inducing or just plain boring. A Teaching Game?If a lot of that sounds like going to school, there's a reason for that: in many ways, EXAPUNKS is a reasonably good primer on assembly programming wrapped up in the attractive packaging of a game. While you won't be able to take what you learn for the game and immediately go apply for a programming job, it nevertheless teaches the basics and gets you started on understanding concepts like code recursion and adaptable programming. In some ways, it's arguably better than some modern classes on the subject as EXAs are severely limited, and you have to shepherd your resources carefully. Unlike modern programming principles which view memory and processing as effectively infinite, you're tightly constrained and need to develop smart, efficient solutions to succeed. That makes this an effective tool for keeping programming skills sharp as well as one for getting people interested in coding a taste of it.The Bottom LineEXPUNKS is an outstanding programming game. Varied missions keep things interesting, and minimal restrictions on tool usagecombined with multiple paths to solve any given problem make it an outstanding problem-solving programming puzzler. Along the way, players will learn efficient programming practices and techniques (mainly because if you don't, you won't get far), and enjoy that real surge of satisfaction of conquering complex problems. However, players need to be willing to put in the effort to learn how to use the tools at their disposal beacuse there's no hand-holding in this game, and patience is key. But for those detail-oriented, technical gamers, EXAPUNKS is a love letter through and through. For those gamers, this is a strongly recommended title that earns an A with ease."
321,2608,Excellent coding puzzle game
322,2608,"So if TIS was the assembly game no one asked for, and Shenzhen is the expansion of that this is the Python/Web hacking game no one asked for."
323,2608,"The atmosphere and ""story"" are fantastic, and while basically every Zachtronics game is ""assembly language programming with a twist"" the twist this time is basically that you have an army of endless but rather incapable EXAs, and it is pretty remarkable in that it reinforces the aesthetic of the game and is also quite fun to manipulate from a programming perspective."
324,2607,"A neat and funny game that is ""easy"" to get into, but difficult to master. I revisit levels trying to improve my score over and over, looking for improvements. The game is basically SHENZHEN IO but with more resources avaliable to you, something that makes the game easier and more accessible while optimization is harder.Great game, Would recommend. AAA+++"
325,2607,Dumpster donuts taste amazing.
326,2607,"Awesome, especially if you like other zachtronic games. The themes and music rock."
327,2607,Best Zachtronics game I've played. The printout you get adds a lot of immersion in the world. Story seems to be pretty coherent and present so far. If you liked other Zachtronic games or enjoy coding you should check this one out.
328,2607,"Another enjoyable Zachtronics game. You program little hacker robots to complete various puzzles. Limitations are around number of bots in a given space, directions they can move and limits to the programming language for the bots. If you've played TIS-100 or Shenzhen, it's similar to those in some ways, but uniquely its own."
329,2607,"If you liked SHENZHEN I/O or TIS-100 or TI-BASIC on your calculator: this will be right up your alley. Likewise, if you have no programming experience but you enjoy puzzles and/or being frustrated then this game may also fill that niche."
330,2607,Excellent coding game anyone can understand. Just pick it up if you are even mildly intrigued.
331,2606,"Ok so as you might expect this is a puzzle game, in which the main goal is to give your character(s) instructions so that they perform a certain task as efficiently as possible. Kinda like Human Resource Machine and the like.But what are the differences? First of all, the instructions are more complicated. This makes it lose some of the fantastic simplicity of nature that Human Resource Machine has, but that... doesn't really matter.Exapunks also heavily limits your memory. In HRM you can store a couple of values while inn Exapunks you can only save 1, sometimes 2 if you find a way to bypass conditional statements. Exapunks also features a wonderful feel, it has lore and a ""chat"" window, which reacts to you completing levels (which is in predetermined order so yeah well it's more lore) and which is written in very colloquial talk. Overall, the game has many elements contributing to the feel, like the Zine, which one is theoretically supposed to print... but you don't have to. Probably more convenient to do so though. I wish I could have done that.I bought this game not expecting much but I was wrong, it was a lot of fun; worth the money."
332,2606,Extremely addictive if you have the time and patience and brains! Absolutely love it.
333,2606,I love this developer. Really fun game if you are into coding and I love the competitive nature of the leader boards always challenging me to write a better program.
334,2606,It's good and will make your brain hurt
335,2606,"Great entry in the iconic Zachtronics game series, this time with an emphasis on distributed computing"
336,2605,"If you've played SHENZEN-IO, this game is very similar, but less restrictive with instructions and space. Each EXA can move around networks all it wants and hold many more instructions (with a very high upper limit that you usually won't even hit). Nonetheless, it's still fun and challenging, you just aren't gonna get stuck on levels as much.Gameplay: Basically, programming in assembly. You have EXAs (EXecution Agents) at your disposal, each can occupy one space in a grid-shaped network (one square represents one memory space). The EXAs can move themselves between networks using links, interact with existing files (or make new ones), or send each other messages. Unlike SHENZEN-IO, EXAs don't have to ""sleep"" to resynchronize and everything is just based on cycles (1 instruction per cycle). One big improvement is the ability to test a specific test run for debuging (each test run is different and there's 100 of them).Besides the main story itself, much like in SHENZEN-IO, you can try building games for a console, which lets you read D-Pad and X, Y, Z button inputs, and display monochromatic pixelated sprites. There's also a ""3D"" mode as they call it, though I haven't tried that out yet. And, as usual, you can create your own levels (with some Javascript knowledge).Story-wise, the game is really immersive and feels like it has an entire world of its own. You get to read a magazine (or just 'zine), which basically functions the same way reference manuals in SHENZEN-IO did (except in a more reader-friendly magazine-like way). And whenever you hack something, you can usually see the effects it had on others, either through the narrative, or through messages from other people in a group chat you're in (you can't interact with it though). For example, hacking a snack company to change the recipe of a product made other chat members a bit weirded out by the (seemingly) company's mistake. And trust me, it made me feel really bad when I had to hack an online game to reset ownership of all buildings and upgrades, and I saw the reactions in the group chat. And no one ever finds out it was you."
337,2605,Awesome puzzle game for folks who love programming.
338,2605,"Excellent game, nice graphics for the style, if you like other Zachtronic games this one will be right up your alley, especially if you like the programming ones like Shenzen I/O."
339,2605,"Fantastic programming puzzle game. Not only is programming the Exas tons of fun, the athmosphere and story really give everything a great framing. This is truly a work of love and everybody who is even remotely in programming puzzles just has to get it. Bonus points for having real 4k assets. Also love the printable ""hacking zine""."
340,2604,awesome game <3
341,2604,"I love puzzle games, and this is a perfect one.If do not know of programming, you may learn something new."
342,2604,"If you like programming puzzles and if you have some sense of humour this is an awesome game for you. The story is that you are a hacker and you need to do a number of illegal things like cracking a region code, connecting nervecells, setting a bill to zero etcetera. The puzzles are easier that the challenges posed in TIS-100 another game in the same family.besides the main game content, there are a number of bonus puzzles and some games to play. The only part I do not like is the hacker tournament. In the workshop you can find some additional content."
343,2604,Im a dum dum but when I get them lil boys goin it feels so good. The soundtrack is amazing too and so far the writing has been really fun.
344,2604,I think this one is *relatively* accessible compared to some of the others...
345,2603,I'm really bad at writing reviews I just wanna contribute to statistics. Good game tho
346,2603,First time I cared about a Zachtronics story line! And on top of that the puzzles are challenging and fun.
347,2603,"Great programming game. More fair than past games by the same developers, but just as hard."
348,2603,Another great puzzle game from Zachtronics.
349,2603,I love this game! Makes me feel smarter than I am...
350,2603,"This is my favorite of Zachtronics' games. Some of the puzzles are tough but most of them provide that perfect ""Eureka!"" moment. The mini games also provide a great side challenge for anyone who wants the challenge of automating the actual interface. The story is surprisingly compelling for this kind of game, and it kept me wanting to know more. By the end of it I was desperately hoping that I was near the end so I could see how it all turned out, but I was still crushed once I realized it was over. I think that's the mark of a good game.The mark of a great game was the reveal of tough bonus levels to assuage that feeling."
351,2602,One of the most unique gaming experiences that I've ever had! Highly recommend for anyone looking for an exciting twist on the puzzle genre.
352,2602,Another great game by Zachtronics.
353,2602,Much easier to get into and solve the puzzle compare to shenzhen IO. Great visual. And even a story and cut scenes to keep me hooked. IMO the best puzzle game from Zachtronics so far.
354,2602,This game has completely sucked me in.
355,2602,"Awesome game! Great introduction to programming concepts that anyone can understand. It's a lot of fun to get a solution that just works, then tweak and optimize it to go for a better solution that takes less cycles, activity, or size."
356,2602,The puzzles are entertaining and feels great to complete quite complex challenges. Not quite as replayable as Spacechem (where I clocked up huge number of hours) but still well worth a go.
357,2602,"Very cool game, if you like solving problems, and think coding is fun then I can't recommend this game any more."
358,2601,"It's a Zachtronics game, you should know if you like them by now."
359,2601,Much more fun then my programming 101 class; and I learned more as well
360,2601,"Ok, first things first, it is not easy. But it's really awesome, if you want to use your brain and stretch your neurons this is the game for you. BTW it is addictive so get a bottle of water next to you so you don't dehydrate. :)"
361,2601,This game is a gosh darned masterpiece.
362,2601,Great game.
363,2601,"Another great game from zachtronic.  The puzzles are tough mind benders as always, and really loved the limited memory coding challenges it presents.The story's basically just window dressing on the game, and it does paint a pretty bleak cyberpunk world, I enjoyed the few characters we get to met, both the voiced in person scenes and the chatroom"
364,2600,Exapunks is a great Zachtronics game. If you have played and enjoyed other Zachtronics games you will love this one.
365,2600,Best of Zachtronics.
366,2600,"Even for an experienced programmer, this is a challenging game. I've never coded in assembler, which is what this compares to. You write primitive, low-level code to make your little bots (EXAs) do things like copy or alter files. Like some related games, it comes with two PDF zines you can print and staple to use as reference material. It's frustrating yet addictive. Very nicely produced. It's a tough little puzzler, but if you're in any way interested in how computers actually work, this is a semi-realistic simulation."
367,2600,"As always, Zachtronics delivers an excellently crafted game of code golf with a good aesthetic and enough to keep you coming back for more."
368,2600,"Fantastic puzzle game where every solution has room for improvement, lots of improvement."
369,2600,If you like games that make you think and use logic get this game. It is an amazing logic teacher and basic coding teacher. if those things don't sound fun to you don't get this game.
370,2599,"Another fantastic Zachtronics game, unifying the coding and technological focus of TIS-100 and Shenzen IO with the spatial awareness and timing of Opus Magnum and Infinifactory. It's also a lot friendlier and easy to learn than some earlier ZTX games, without sacrificing any of the depth. If you've ever enjoyed a coding puzzle game before, or think you might, this is a must-buy."
371,2599,"Zachtronics has yet to release a game I don't enjoy. Whenever I get one I immediately check if there are any sort of manuals in the installation folder. Which reminds me of the days when I first started programming: the internet wasn't as common in households yet and typically slow. When you found a programming book it usually had a guide, tutorials and a language reference if it was nice quality. Whenever you had issues it was common to talk to other programmers over internet relay chat, go over the language reference again seeing if you missed something or bug one of your family & friends if they had similar interests. The developer commonly captures all these feelings in each game. This one captured it particularly well and is fun to play around with without being too restrictive. You don't need experience in coding to enjoy the game, but by playing it you will become comfortable with the bread and butter concepts of any good programming language. This is my favorite of the developer's games so far, but this may change as I haven't beat each and every game yet. I support this developer through multiple gaming platforms because I support the quality of their work and hope for future releases. If you enjoy detailed puzzle games with replay value that are well made and may spark interests that can develop into technical literacy. You've found a gem here."
372,2598,"Not as interesting as other hacking games, and it feels pretty hands off and the puzzles all seem more like infinifactory instead of hacking per se. its like most of the development went into the aesthetics instead of the game complexity"
373,2598,My brain is about the explode. Awesome game.
374,2596,Requires you to have a manual printout or on another screen. Makes it to complicated
375,2595,"The mix between puzzling and programming makes this a difficult, yet compelling game. You feel intelligent when you manage to find an elegant solution, and really embarrassed when you revisit old ones.Pro tip: Look up solutions for completed puzzles on YouTube, for a barrage of aha-moments."
376,2595,"Love all Zachtronics games, and this one is no exception."
377,2594,"Having played SpaceChem and OpusMagnum, this is my favorite Zachtronics game so far. In my opinion, SpaceChem has some very strict restrictions which turn some assignments into the the trial and error problem of ""how to compress your already thought out logic into something that somehow fits"". Opus Magnum however gives you too much freedom, so that it is not very demanding to find any solution (not talking about optimization here). Exapunks is just in-between, but the main reason for me favoring it over the other two games is mostly because I like real programming more than the visual stuff. The assembler-like programming language has a small enough instruction set that does not overstrain your memory but gives enough freedom for difficult assignments and optimization possibilities. The community is one of the greatest and there are lots of user-made workshop levels available. The only two things that I don't find optimal are the interface and the music. Debugging can be annoying, because you have to scroll through your code and having a few clones of Exas with many instructions greatly inflates the code shown during runtime. The soundtrack consists of too few tracks, so I disabled it early in the game. But after all, this is a very recommendable game! I have also stored TIS-100 and Shenzhen I/O in my library for next year, but from what I've heard, I don't expect them to be better than Exapunks.Edit: I now know that you can run your code until a set point with Alt+Click which helps a lot with debugging. I also started clicking more frequently the Exa drones on the screen to scroll automatically to the code junk which they run with. Its still not optimally laid out, but these were some improvements in my development process of the solutions."
378,2594,"great atmosphere, great story, excellent puzzles and mechanics!"
379,2593,when work is boring i come here to do fun programming
380,2593,"No bugs, much attention to detail, good story. Everything I want in a game."
381,2592,EXAPUNKS is a programming game like TIS-100 and SHENZHEN I/O but the language is just slightly more helpful and the environment has just slightly fewer constraints than those games which makes EXAPUNKS a much more enjoyable and less frustrating game to play.
382,2591,"This game is the utterly fantastic spiderbot hacking simulator I didn't realize I wanted. If you enjoy using actual code to solve puzzles, you'll love this game. It's a Zachtronics game, so be prepared for some rather challenging puzzles, but it's not as punishingly difficult as say, SpaceChem (I've nearly beaten the game with about ~50 hrs in). It's very reasonably priced for the amount of fun it offers."
383,2589,"came for the code, stayed for the cards"
384,2588,"This game (and all zachtronic games tbh) is great! It's a really well made and well thought through game about programming that has an interesting emphasis on parallell programming.I feel like this game can be a great introduction to programming to non-programmers, as the assembly language used in the game is very simple, but still very powerfull and fun.As a profesionnal programmer, I'm having a lot of fun playing this game and trying to optimize my solution by comparing the level metrics to my program's. Every level feels different and interesting and there were quite a few surprise for me in the game.I also like that you have to dig up all the info in 'zines' pdfs, old school style. It's nostalgicly refreshing hehe."
385,2588,"stupid, I dont want to print out some 'zine' or toggle to a window to read a PDF. the workhouse task is absurd, the receipt looks better than the font you are typing inthe story aspect of this is pointless"
386,2588,Love this game. It brings back my old firmware testing days. Been spending hours optimizing code. The card game is also pretty addictive.
387,2588,"I expected this game to be wayyyy more similar to Hacknet, because thats what most of the reviews said. Instead what i got is a TIS-100 type of game (which is another very similar game made by Zachtroics). It starts out pretty nice, there are some cutscenes and the whole thing looks slick. Then, you have to read some 'zines'. To make any progress, you need to read a PDF document, so you know what to do. You need to constantly ALT-TAB the game to read the PDF. Sometimes ALT-TABBING doesn't even work and i have to exit to the main room and re-open the zines.I never liked the fact that i have to read a user manual for TIS-100 to play the game, and neither in this game. This feels like work. This feels like when i buy a new tech gadget with really complicated mechanisms and i have to read a manual before doing anything. Very boring. I'm just gonna warn you that the experience is nowhere near Hacknet and you have to read. The game even suggests that you PRINT the zines out and staple them together, so you can get the 'full experience'.  you.Refunding way easy tho so that's good"
388,2588,"Terrific game, as usual, from Zachtronics.This is basically TIS-100 on steroids.  Plus you get a cool cyberpunk story, some voice acting, and visuals that make it much more immersive than TIS-100.Definitely a must-buy for a Zachtronics fan - I would say this is my favorite of all their games so far (SpaceChem being a close 2nd)."
389,2587,Zachtronics always make you feel like you're a smart hackerman in the tutorial after that you will crying out loud like first grade kid who trying to solve level5 Calculus.
390,2587,"It's beyond painful. The puzzles are so hard to figure out and irritate me to no end. But when you solve it, you lift up both your hands with two middle fingers up and think,  you Zach, I beat it! And then you clam down and feel disapointed that your solution was poor. Love the game. Utter waste of money because you'll probably not be able to solve it but if you do you'll feel like a god among men."
391,2587,"This is not a game! It's sort of an attempt to teach coding.I code all day for a living, I don't really want to it in a game."
392,2587,"Before anything else, you should know that this game will involve coding.Your reaction to the previous sentence should pretty much decide whether you want this game or not.This game is most definitely not for everyone. Some people crave excitement of FPS. Some people want tactics of RTS. This game is for people that want satisfaction of their code beating problem - akin to beating dark souls bosses. Zachtronics have been producing programming puzzle games for at least a decade, and each one of them are reasonably varied. Unlike that other game, TIs-100 where limitation was half of the battle, Exapunks seems to be very loose on restriction.EXAs(unit of processing) has memories, can create storage at will and duplicate. Plus, there is no limit of code on EXAs either.(other than campaign limit.Going over limit will only disable scoreboard)While difficulties does increase, do does code limit. It is quiet good.Very much recommended if on sale, and if you are into this kind of thing.Later puzzle may require you to find out viable solution behind it. I sat on final puzzle for 2 hours.Minor complaints:While difficulty of campaign does generally goes up, Later missions have few easy ones sprinkled in them.For later missions, Play is too slow and FF is way too fast.If you have 20 EXAs(duplicated) with 100 code each, it is kind of hard to see what is going on.NO ""Step Back"" button."
393,2587,"My favourite Zachtronics game so far and among my all time favourite games period (a list that definitely includes SpaceChem, Shenzen I/O and Opus Magnum as well). It's probably the most challenging Zachtronics game I've played so far, even with some programming background. The limited ""hardware"" resources each EXA has available means solutions are rarely as straightforward as you first envision them and I've had to bust out a pen and paper to work through solutions on a number of occasions. Despite the difficulty, I think the early levels introduce programming concepts like variables, branching, recursion, scope, and race conditions gradually enough that the game is still approachable by someone with no coding experience. I reckon for most there's probably a solid 20-30 hrs gameplay in the main story alone. Definitely worth the full price in my opinion.Would love to see a standalone ""Hackstasy"" game that fleshes out the PvP mechanic even further."
394,2587,"This is one of the best multi-threading coding games I've played!  7 Billion Humans was great too... But this one is different.   You spawn another ""code robot"" right in your code and branch him off to do his thing... All in the main code.  I like it.  I just did the ""copy machine place hack (Zebros, i think)"", where you have to zero out a balance and add to the payment file....  It was really cool to create the new bots to do the work -- to overcome the limits of only having one file open at a time, etc.  Like some have said, you do have to look at the ""manual"" for the game to learn the OP codes, etc.  They did it in a fun way.  It's a PDF file that you read on the side (I'm using my tablet).  I think I've gotten all the commands memorized now though, so you won't need it all the time, just when you are first learning.  It's a high quality game and worth it, if you are into coding games.  It's definitely unique the way you have to run your robot around to the right room (network) and access the different data.  And it's nice to only have one block of code for it all."
395,2587,"Thought this was just gonna be a small, non-impactful gameoh how i was wrongLike the story, Ember is my nerdy hearts baethe game play is the biggest brainteaser Ive had in awhile and im not much for programming but this game really eased me into it and love itevery single map is a new challenge, it is never the same task twice and teaches you new ways to think every timebig thumbs up from me if you're into any kind of hacking/programmingsome after thoughts, just love how when you start a new map it seems impossible but as you start breaking it down bit by bit everything just seems to come togetherand if anyone has any interest in pursuing computer science as a major, this is basically the game for you, for obvious reasons, but to highlight, its more about having the computer(s) solve the problem for you and how to instruct them to do so, rather than you solving the problems yourselfP.S.I find negative reviews for this rather funny and pettyone for title screen being too loud? ... uhh pretty sure everyone can control their own volume lol also pretty sure that doesn't ruin a gameone complaining this game isnt a game because you write code? uhh... what were you expecting???quite laughable stuff lol"
396,2587,"Very nice game for nerds. 2 pages instruction set makes it far less scary to grasp than any real world simple microprocessor and is actually a lot of fun when you have to really think how to use that 1,5 registers to figure out challenges.It is a must have for a gamer programmers."
397,2587,"Full disclosure, I learned to program using a Vic-20 with a register set almost as limited as the devices represented in the game. So needless to say I'm absolutely loving this game, and I'm only 3 hours into it. Zach truly nailed it with this game. It has dystopian cyberpunk and body hacking elements, mixed with 80's/90's hacker zines with a nice story line to boot. As replay bonus, I imagine I will go back and optimize my solutions to try to rank higher in the leaderboards. Much fun for a software engineer such as myself, and I can see it spurring the interests of those learning to code.Edit: 44 hours later and I have finished the game (with no hints from anyone). I will go back now and work on the achievements. I LOVED this game! I'd say the final challenges were incredibly demanding.The final challenge in particular was quite difficult, but as a result I am left with an incredible feeling of accomplishment In the end I solved it with a solution that is 147 out of 150 instructions long.This is obviously a game, but I truly felt like I was coding in those 8-bit days again, creating machine language on the fly, even using some of my old tricks.Such fun!"
398,2587,awesome gamealthough it may be too hard if you never ever been doing algorithmicsthe way the tutorial is implemented in the game is unusual but very coolExapunks is pretty similar to Opus magnum in the way it has to encourage players to perfect their solution to a specific level; if you think it's going to be too hard for you I highly recommand to watch about Opus Magnum
399,2587,"1997 just hit you up on the beeper and is stopping by to drop off a 12 pack of Surge and some flaming hot Cheetos, it's time to put those L33t Hax0r ski11s to the test!PROS: It comes with printable swag game manual.CONS: Couldn't print it on a dot matrix."
400,2587,"Very good game. Unlike its looking, this game is very carefully designed making the learning curve gently just enough to solve and progress. Although you are forced to print zine and pick up information form it, all you needs are closed in the whole game experience. This game is totally designed as a puzzle game and less context. It is completely different from competitive programming which is high context, requiring knowledge of algorithm implementations or math number theory.Another outstanding excellence of this game is total dedication for immersion feeling. Beginning from zines printed, chats like good old IRC, solitaire game (why Russian), console game (why Japanese) and story line. Apparently the game experience was designed to include the player in a universe of game inside.These effectively worked for me, the game playing became a unforgettable part of my experience.The atmosphere of this game also has some affinities with the computer community of Japan in the same era. I realized these cultures had been almost the same between the sea in these days.It is only disappointment point that no translation exists. I wish it had translation, or had CJK fonts for community translation. I might had do it if it had."
401,2587,EXAPUNKS is a fun version of TIS-100
402,2587,I'll be honest: I've learned more about coding within the first hour of this than during my entire Computer Science class in college.
403,2587,"10/10 would get ears blown out when launching game first time again.But for real, really cool game and challenging."
404,2587,"I feel like this is even better than the last couple of zach games, though i liked them all.Pretty good and high variety puzzles so far...looking forward to play more."
405,2585,"Probably the best puzzle game I've played, and my favorite Zachtronics game so far."
406,2585,My favorite Zachtronics game
407,2585,"LET US TURN THE  VOLUME DOWN BEFORE BLASTING THE WHOLE NEIGHBOURHOOD WITH EARDRUM BURSTING NOISE FOR A WHOLE MINUTE WHILE THE DAMN GAME LOADS FOR THE FIRST TIME, YOU  MANIACS!, even turning everything down to just before it turns off you still have to turn down the system volume to the point than even dogs can't hear any other system sounds or sounds from other programs, and it's still almost unbearable... how is this  not violating every  noise regulation in the damn world!? It's absolutely unplayable unless you turn all  sounds off!(Also, I'm not going to  copy the whole text of a  restaurant ticket, where the  is the  game? Other zachtronics games were playable and fun from the start, didn't need a  keyboard, and didn't make me bleed from the ears; uninstalled and to the malware folder it goes... at least I bought it on sale, but I just wanted to have some fun playing a nice zachtornics-style game, now there's no fun, only anger, frustration, and pain, and I've got to find a doctor I can book through email because I can't use the  phone.)"
408,2585,I am not intelligent enough.
409,2584,Absolutely fantastic
410,2583,"I am coming to this game after having played Shenzhen IO. I have completed maybe 50% of the Exapunks\ main campaign and the puzzles seem to be less challenging than in the previous game. The solution is straight forward most of the time and you just need to enter it as a code. The limitations are definitely less strict in Exapunks than they are in the previous game. And because of that you get less of those ""eureka"" moments as you had in Shenzhen IO where the space was limited and you had to fight for every line and exploit every code hack and look for the best algorithm. But nevertheless the game has its share of fun moments. I think it would be great for people who want to get the grasp of the concept of coding. As the basic idea is the same no matter what language you use. It's just the real programming language is more versatile as it is meant to be used to solve various problems other than just manipulating files as in Exapunks. .And  it is in the niche of its own. So recommend it."
411,2583,"If you want a very basic form of assembly this game is great for that, and understanding how to make the most effective code concepts. Compilers are known to do weird things to get the least amount of CPU cycles, making ""questionable assembly"" choices.  Which I think this game makes you do wonderfully. Besides instilling good concept behaviors, the game is very challenging, fun, and stressful."
412,2583,Can be a bit difficult but SUPER rewarding to to figure out!
413,2583,"Outstanding game, I've played close to anything that Zachtronics published but this one is the most polished product they released. A joy to solve puzzles and so much freedom. Totally recommended."
414,2583,"Very good brain twister with an interesting backstory, nice interface and lovely music -- as per usual for Zachtronics games!"
415,2582,Fun little game
416,2582,"Another great programming game from Zachtronics. Clean, intuitive UI for easy development. Still on the fence about the external programming manual, but it added to the cyberpunk universe atmosphere. I recommend this for anyone interested in programming or logical thinking."
417,2582,"Zachtronics, you've done it again!"
418,2582,"Zachtronics has been making programming and engineering games for a long time, and they're super good. I think this one is no exception, and I think there is real innovation on top of previous electronics engineering games.A common complaint with this kind of game is that it quickly begins to feel like 'work', and while I think I got much further in this game before I felt that to be the case, with EXAPUNKS it still did feel like work. I write code for fun in my spare time, and there are cases where levels felt less fun than that. I think it comes down to a key design decision made by Zachtronics games -- that the language used in the game should be extremely simple and most particularly in the canon of these games: include no re-usable functions or higher-level operations, even code generation.See, the problem is that the fun part of each level is working out the way to optimally solve it, but the not fun part is the amount of repetition involved in that solution. Most puzzles do not involve writing a huge amount of original code, but instead repeating similar patterns by hand. The most common of these is loop unrolling, in which you make what would normally be a loop with jumps instead a flat procedure. this requires tracking labels and control flow to allow certain cases to fall through which is boring as hell. I don't want to open a level, be excited by the idea of solving it but totally deflated by the idea that I'll have to set up 30 labels and jumps again.As always with these games, my criticism is only that I can't take advantage of the most important thing in programming: reusable code. Just let me write a function library I can re-use in puzzles and I'd die for this ."
419,2582,"I think Zachtronics has shown steady improvement in programming games over time, as they've learned from their players what works and what doesn't. I have enjoyed almost all of Zachtronics' games but limitations such as the pipework in tight spaces between the reactors in Spacechem  or the size of the circuit boards in Shenzhen I/O have sometimes frustrated me more than challenged me in a stimulating way. Perhaps I should have been more patient with myself as I struggled to figure out how to construct a working factory or device within the limitations of these games, but I think the average player might prefer to limit that struggle to the time after solving the puzzle when they wish to improve upon their solution. This is why I like EXAPUNKS. The challenges in this game come more from the complex logic underlying each puzzle than from frustrating limitations. It is the second Zachtronics game than I plan to finish the main campaign of, alongside Opus Magnum. I would definitely recommend this game first out of all Zachtronics' selection.(Also it's about time Zachtronics made a hacking-themed game.)"
420,2582,"If you have any interest in programming then you should play this. As I write this I'm only about 12 hours in - so it's still early days - but every puzzle so far has been enjoyable, and it's fun comparing your solutions to your friends. Right now half the game *is* looking at friends scores and asking myself how I can shave a few cycles off my solution. Great stuff, looking forward to seeing how mind-melting the late game becomes."
421,2582,"This game is great in the same vein as TIS-100 and Shenzhen IO but with new challenges and ""gimmicks."" It also lets you build programs to battle against your friends which are extremely cool."
422,2582,"(SW-Engineer): Great beginning but get's tedious after 8h. Use github solutions to see the disappointing ending of a cool starting story. Like many/all Zachtronics games a bit too focused on the puzzle aspect. It leaves much more freedom to solve puzzles than TIS-100, but definitely lets you wish for a 8080 or MIPS chipset. Functions, stacks, more then one direct register and the like would be nice as well as some IDE functions. I hope in the future there will be a game where this is the hacking. An RPG like system shock but no shooting."
423,2582,"Entertaining puzzle game that let me flex some old unused programming muscles.  The story is a little light, but the logic puzzles are excellent.The dev is still on top of fixes and support even now, and answered a report I made within a day. (there was no actual bug, I just flaked out on my logic and thought the game was broken at one point.)Solid game, if you like these sorts of puzzles it is definitely worth the price of purchase.Rarely am I this pleased with a steam purchase.  Pick it up if you can."
424,2582,Good puzzler
425,2582,Cool game
426,2582,Great game for people who like programming and solving puzzles
427,2582,Zach2077
428,2582,One of the best coding games I've played :)
429,2582,"Another solid Zachtronics game. It feels entry-level, most puzzles aren't too tough, but it's still a lot of fun."
430,2582,Zachtronics does it again. The best one yet.
431,2582,Fantastic puzzles
432,2582,Excellent programming game with a compelling story to boot!
433,2582,It's a great feeling when you solve a complex problem you thought was insanely difficult
434,2582,A brilliant new programming puzzle game from Zachtronics. Atmospheric and fun.
435,2582,Zachtronics games never disappoint
436,2582,Great game
437,2582,i wish it is as easy to hack and get free pizzas in real life!
438,2582,Cool game
439,2582,"i love zachtronics  and i play nearly all of their games in various platform, but this is the first game i cant finish it, not even half of it(i think). i am not a programmer, but i have to use the language of computer to solve problem in this game,not visual programming, you type it word by word.i am not good at it,but being able to try to be a programmer is a experience, i fully enjoyed the hours i spent in this game.as someone said, zachtronics games make you feel you are genius and idiots at the same time"
440,2582,"Great game, really makes you feel like you're programming in some sort of assembly language and the leaderboards force you to try to get better.Great if you want progressively more difficult puzzles to solve. I enjoyed this game immensely."
441,2582,all zachtronic games are the same and they are always fun
442,2582,Caused a pizza rave party accidentally. 10/10 would write to random registers again.
443,2582,"A real brain burner. The included ""hacking zine"" is a necessary resource. Read it, use it, love it."
444,2582,Solid Zachtronics quality. Nice headscratchingly challenging puzzles
445,2582,Pretty fun game.  Printing out the zines was a nice touch.
446,2582,buy this
447,2582,a very fun logical programming/proof based game! if you're casual or a pro at programming/coding try this out!
448,2582,"I love this game. It's for sure the best of all Zachtronics games and also the best programming game I've played so far in general. It gives you a lot of room for your code and you are not as limited as in SHENZEN I/O for example. Also has a good and interesting story and beautiful, modern graphics."
449,2582,"The game is very immersive. Like it. Only play for 0.5 hour now, will write more later."

453,2580,"Love it. Everybody has to play this... It is so rewarding too as it keeps giving me hidden mini games, and every one of them is another solid game. Plus it makes us appreciate high level programming languages."
454,2580,"EXAPUNKS is a hacker logic puzzle game for a special target group. You should have some background knowledge about the assembly language, because you program the puzzles in a similar language. The single sequences then take place e.g. in a national bank or other servers. The maps are arranged in the isometric perspective and your single programs run as small spider robots over the map. This looks a lot like cyberpunk, but without rain, violet colors and keyboard background music. The story is told very quickly. It is 1997 and you are a junk who needs money for his medicine. Through a chat a guy is chatting to you and from then on you have to solve tasks. The breathed on pixel design is atmospheric and fits to what you imagine under a hacker setting. Tutorials can be read in Zines and you can already see that people from the programming and demo scene were involved in the game. All in all the game is for friends who like to stay good hacker puzzles and move in a cyberpunk setting."
455,2578,It's good. Great universe. Up there with Spacechem and Opus.
456,2577,"It's a very near miss for me. I played and enjoyed all the previous Zachtronics, but for the most part this game just feels like the muddy average of all of them: Learn the rules, play some solitaire, learn some more rules, then introduce a sandbox for the player to create and recreate stuff to put in the workshop, etc. The story also doesn't have nearly as much of the punch or realism as the other games.I think I prefer and can more easily recommend the ""machine"" games (Spacechem, Infini, Opus) than the ""literal-electronic"" games (TIS, Shenzhen and Exa). These offer some crunching challenge, but so can the ""machine"" games, and I find solving the puzzles in those much more satisfying.Still, if restrictive coding is your thing, there's worse games to sink time into."
457,2577,Hackerman mode - /ON/10/10 if you can understand what to do.
458,2577,"I'll keep this short. I moved from a very violent city in CA(Victorville) to a not so violent one(Banning). In doing so I had to give up everything that made my life my life. My friends, my job, my family. I will never return to that place. All topped off with having to sue my own sister for my property, my first instance ever in court. Then retrieve that property(a 26 ft trailer) with a court order I was awarded, under duress, while my Brother-in-Law recorded me. I had never moved anything like that before. Needless to say, by the time I got to where I live now, I felt like . Weeks of strain pushing me down a hole.And on that first day here, the special edition guide arrived in the mail. A guide I never paid for, but had spoken to Zach briefly about before I moved in which I told him nothing except I didn't have the money at the moment and was about to change location. No pity story, nothing about where I lived or suing my sister. He had no reason to do that, and I stood in my driveway crying with his guide in my hands. Could it have been a mistake? Yes, but I don't think it was. He will probably never know how much that meant to me at that time, and how much it means to me now. He gave me the first ""housewarming"" gift I have ever received, and the only congratulations I ever got for escaping that hellhole alive. Please support Zachtronics. I support Zachtronicsbecause he supported me.EDIT: Since this review has garnered a bit of attention, I would like to mention that Zach has, since my original review was written back in Feb/March, begun offering his games to teachers at absolutely NO cost to the teachers or their schools. I think it's important to support people like Zach, as such, Zachtronics is developing yet another great looking game, the link to which you can find below. You can help him by wishlisting the game to boost its visibility in the Steam store. https://store.steampowered.com/app/716500/Eliza/"
459,2575,"Whenever I try to use multiple of these EXAs to solve a problem I always end up with race conditions. Also, never try to solve problems by using an EXA as a sort of poor man's message passing IPC hub when you don't need to. It's a terrible idea. Don't do it....most of my solutions aren't terrible but usually end up being one or two EXAs doing the job, occasionally with some behavior vaguely resembling fork().Actual review opinion; if you've never touched a console, batch scripting, or actual programming in your life, do not buy this game. It will frustrate you. On the other hand, for someone with even a modicum of technical expertise this is pretty  good. And hard."
460,2575,"Wow, amazing. Intuitive, original, well-designed, good-plot, exciting print-outs, challenging game-play, helpful tutorials, its just really a fantastic game. Been playing Zachtronics since Infiniminer back in the day and still not disappointed. Hope he keeps making more."
461,2575,Good stuff
462,2575,Really good puzzles. Really good pacing.  The zines are excellent for teaching the mechanics and setting the mood all at once. Surprisingly one of the most immersive games Ive played recently.
463,2574,Serious programming wrapped in idealized hacker story; printable zines for maximum immersion; great sound track. Perfect.
464,2574,Great game!
465,2573,A multiplayer Zachtronic game featuring head-to-head bot matches that is every bit as good as it sounds.
466,2571,"The best ""Zach-like"" game yet. Even if it is by Zach. Another excellent puzzle game from Zachtronics.  If you've never played a game like this before, this is an open-ended puzzle game. By ""open-ended"" I mean there is a problem you are trying to solve, and you are given tools (in this case a programming language for what appears to be tiny robots) to solve it as you choose.  You build a solution to the presented problem. You win if the solution works but how you get to a working solution is up to you.  There are limits to your freedom both by the language and what the ""little robots"" can accomplish at one time. The puzzle here revolves around writing little program fragments that unfold through parallelization into pretty impressive results. It is a complete programming language (although a very simple one) and even has a little test-bed where you can make your own creation without a specific goal.Now if that sounds like a standard puzzle game. I'd say the big difference even compared to games like Lemmings, Portal, even World of Goo is that you have a lot of freedom to your approach.  That means while you may use a guide or a faq to help you.  You are usually not trying to guess the puzzle designer's intention explicitly. Although the way certain puzzles are designed to encourage a certain approach. You can usually design a solution that ignores the obvious solution. In fact, usually, the best solutions don't choose the obvious approach at all.  You are given the same set of tools at the first problem as you are in the last. The other big difference is that the steps to solve puzzles are usually quite elaborate. That means while you may use a guide or a FAQ to help you.  You are usually not trying to guess the puzzle designer's intention explicitly.  In fact, most of the guides for this game do not give explicit solutions because of this variance. Although the way certain puzzles are designed to encourage a certain approach. You can usually design a solution that ignores the obvious solution. Usually the best solutions don't choose the obvious approach at all.  What I think is ""obvious"" may well just be obvious to me. This style of game is now called a ""Zach-like"" after the programmer Zach Barth who owns Zachtronics.  Most games like this are developed by Zachtronics which develops games like this almost exclusively.In this game, the puzzles in the ""main"" story usually require you to learn a new concept. This is very well implemented here. It seems almost every puzzle has a particular ""concept"" it was trying to relay. I usually find this the cleverest part of Zach-lines especially compared to its competitors. Frequently, you have a puzzle description and you begin only to learn that the techniques you used in the last puzzle aren't enough You have to learn how to exploit the language in a slightly new way.  This, in my opinion, is Zachtronic's best-paced game in that regard. Each puzzle poses a unique challenge, and each was trying to teach the player a new technique building on what came before. Despite the minimal-hand holding this acing is the games best strength.The story in Zach's games always strikes me as better than they have any right to be.  It might sound like a trivial point, but he always adds characters and situations compelling enough to dive you to spend an hour or so trying to beat down these puzzles, there is very little hand holding after you start a puzzle so this motivation is sorely needed.  The setting is the late 90's and its fictional hacker universe is well researched and creative.  Having been a computer science student at the time it was very pleasant reliving some of the early ""cyber"" cultures of the period.  Your value in that kind of Nostalgia may vary. Honestly, the early hacking world before ""The Matrix"" and ""Facebook and smartphones seem like a half-remembered dream to me. Anyway the ""hacking"" is even by the standards of the '90s more than a little fake. That's okay because this puzzle game is more of an enjoyable abstraction about little robots running an assembly language like code. A point the game lampshades itself in a particular puzzle. More realistic hacking simulations can be found in games like ""Hack-Net"". Those types of games are a genre in of themselves since Introversion's seminal Uplink and are puzzles of a sort but err more on the side of simulation and risk-reward strategies.  This game is about origami unfolding robots accomplish a set programming task more so than providing computer network defenses. If that sounds like a complaint, I will say I found this game much more challenging than most ""hacking:"" games. This one at least has you actually programming on some level. But the story does make for a very good premise for the puzzles whose premises are inspired by real hacking events.  One, in particular, is obviously referencing STUXNET and the Iranian nuclear program. If you have played a zachtronics game before this is one of the harder ones. It's about as difficult as SpaceChem or Shenzhen I/O.  It seems harder than Opus Magnum or Infinifactory.  Now that's just my opinion. Very hard to quantify difficult in games with this much freedom. A lot of people mention that the last game Opus Magnum doesn't have limitations on the number of instructions, parts, or space to design. There are harder limitations on space here. There are sometimes limitations on parts.  There is technically no limitation on the number of instructions you write but you are ""encouraged"" by the histograms to get underneath a set number.  I think Zachtronics is always at a balancing act between making a game ""too-easy"" by letting you freely design what you want or making it uniquely challenging through limitation. I like the balance here more than any other game. I think the story, difficulty curve, and pacing comes together in a very compelling way hereSo in short if you like hard puzzles games that really give you a lot of freedom to explore buy this game. If you're not sure and want less of a challenge than buy Opus Mangnum by the same developer. If you want something graphically interesting and dont have trouble thinking in 3d space, then buy infinifactory also by Zachtronics."
467,2571,Probably my favorite Zachtronics so far.
468,2570,"Zachtronics shines again with a great game for dorks.  If youre into programming, I can easily recommend EXAPUNKS as a programming-themed puzzle game. Thats still a pretty important distinction to keep in mind, going in. A large part of these types of games is working around the deliberate omission of things commonly found in programming languages (or even hardware functionality). So, solutions are more about cleverness than realistic or good programming. But, the positive side is that it keeps the code simple enough for non-programmers to pick up and use. Id say the game is easier then ShenZhen IO, but also less frustrating to manage as you dont have as much of a strict limit on lines of code. Overall, its a great puzzle game and with a buy."
469,2569,Another amazing programming game from Zachtronics. Uses assembly-like language similar to Shenzhen I/O and needs to print and read the manual.
470,2569,"IMO the best Zachtronics game. Much more accessible than Shenzen, but still challenging and tons of fun."
471,2568,Absolutely mind-blowing game.
472,2568,"Another great game from Zachtronics. Not as hard as the previous titles, but a lot of fun nevertheless."
473,2567,Zachtronics does it again - but with an even deeper world. Really love how much thought was put into the aesthetic of the story and how aligned it is with the gameplay!
474,2566,"Best Zachtronics game so far, if you like'd the others you'll like this."
475,2566,Assembly is difficult...
476,2566,"Exactly like work, but only the funnest parts."

478,2565,"Good and fun set of problems to solve. Usually more than one answer for each one, so maybe it means the game is a little more friendly with newcomers than I first thought.The graphics are nice, making the game far more engaging than TIS100, at least for me.But beware: the game contains a lot of content on PDF manuals, which can make some people unsatisfied. I personally like it, because I can read better those than in game content, and is an opportunity to build more lore.As a result, this is now one of my favorite puzzle games."
479,2564,"Have spent the last 12 hours wearing a black hoodie, fingerless gloves, and listening to synthwave while hammering out code on my Model-M keyboard.100% accurate hacking simulator. Would pwn the feds again."
480,2564,"I'm a huge fan of Zachtronics' prior coding games, TIS-100 and SHENZHEN I/O. But those games were hit-or-miss with people... This, on the other hand, I recommend to anyone pursuing computer science as a hobby or as a craft.I started playing yesterday and I've played for 9 hours (as of this review). It's addicting, and Zachtronics has a penchant for using story and features to motivate you. Indeed -- 9 hours in and I'm still unlocking completely new parts of the game (multiplayer, game sandbox, etc)!Brilliant soundtrack as usual by Matthew Burns; I've bought the OST on Bandcamp already.This game is far less restrictive than previous Zachtronics games. It still makes you earn it... but it's much more intuitive and you can get away with less optimal solutions. As always, the global histograms show you how you did compared to every other player -- another driver for better, efficient solutions.Warning: Another staple of Zachtronics games, there is a set of documentation. Despite some negative reviews, keep in mind: The documentation is *all* you need to know *everything* about the game. No need to look up mysterious information on Google. And *unlike* previous Zachtronics games, EXAPUNKS' documentation reads like a magazine instead of like technical manuals. Makes it a lot more readable.Wait for a Steam sale if you must, but put this game on your wishlist and challenge your friends to make better solutions. Custom puzzles and games and such were a harder sell in SHENZHEN I/O... but this game just makes me feel eager to participate with other players."
481,2564,i'm not smart enough for this game
482,2563,"Sorry, supplemental reading for a puzzle game is a hard no."
483,2562,"This is not a fun game.  I like coding-type puzzle games, but this is just work.  I can do that in the day, so no thanks.It could have been made a lot more user friendly, or a lot more interesting, but it's neither."
484,2562,"It's not so much as a puzzle game as it is just programming. If you're fine with alt tabbing out of the game to read a 'zine' that's going to tell you what you need to know, then plug that information into the game to solve a puzzle then you might enjoy this. If you're looking for a game with a rule set you have to work with to come up with a solution on your own then you're probably not going to enjoy this."
485,2561,"Fantastic. It's like receiving a ZX81 as a child again. Getting lost in the problem solving that is programming. Discovered the beauty of MODI, DIVI and the number 9 today"
486,2561,"This game is unintimidating without sacrificing rigor. My non-programmer friends can successfully compete levels, and I and others with experience can get endless thrills pushing the EXAs to their limits. The language is simple but believable as an assembly-style virtual machine byte code.One of my favorite Zachtronics games of all time with well thought out story to go with the puzzles. These games keep getting better. Bravo!"
487,2561,"Generally fun for the usual programming inclined crowd, but if you have a low tolerance for tedium your interest may taper off towards the back half(?) of the game: you will need to write and debug large amounts of code, but are still limited to a TIS-100-style syntax with minor improvements. The ratio of fun puzzle-style insights to programming tedium decreases, and for me, ended the journey at a level where I needed to precisely synchronize a set of signals. Still, that journey was fun while it lasted so I do recommend the game."
488,2561,"I'm actually surprised that among those few negative reviews only one stated that it's yet another Zach coding game all of which sort of have the same concept and gameplay, and the rest of the negative reviews are written by actual brainlets who can't figure out how to open a pdf in their browser.Previous games had some sort of a sterile minimalistic art style which motivated the player to find a cleaner solution to a given problem.As of yet I think that removal of any restrictions concerning number of lines of code actually harms the game in terms of replayability of any given level in comparison to TIS or Shenzhen.Why would I want to improve my algorithms if literally any Rube Goldbergs abomination of a solution would suffice? The UI won't be any less cluttered anyway.You may like the game if you're into puzzles and if it's gonna be your first Zachtronics coding game, otherwise it's meh.I may change my opinion in the future when I'll have a bit more playtime.Not refunded.Edit: Consider this an informational review."
489,2561,"I got all Zachtronic games and this is the best.It was very frustrating in shenzen i/o (the predecessor) when you just needed one extra line of code or just an extra cell for completing your solution, but there werent any left.I am so glad this game hasnt this limitations - you just dont get in the leaderbords, but you can complete the level.And btw. the sizes are very fair, as for now i could manage to stay in size for every level of the campaign."
490,2561,"Very few games compel me enough to try my hand at programming when I do that as a living as an indie dev. It just seems less like fun and more like work to me. That is, until I tried Exapunks, which is by far the most fun I've had with a programming-like game ever. The atmosphere is fantastic, with nice voice work and a great art style. But by far my most favorite addition is the printable Zine, where you read up on tutorials and tips for upcoming levels in a magazine-style format. It led to me realizing, during a particularly tough level, ah-hah! I read about this in that Zine a few days ago! I cannot tell you how satisfying it was to solve problems that way. I'm up to the second Zine, which may be the half-way point, I'm not sure, but I've had a blast so far. Great art, gameplay, just about everything works so well in this game. Highly recommended! And be sure to print up the Zine too- while not mandatory (there's an optional PDF available), it really does immerse you more into the game."
491,2560,Zachtronics always makes good games.

495,2559,"great game. similar to shenzhen io - assembly with limitaitons. you have much more freedom as a programmer here though. shenzhen IO gave you 9/14 lines before you had to do communications between multiple chips.story - cliches everywhere, but i found it quite interesting.here you are allowed many more lines (50-150) spread across as many 'exas' (little robots) as you like. communication is easier, a global channel (anywhere to anywhere), and a local channel (only bots in the same room)no if statements. instead you have marks and 'jump if true' rather than enabling/disabling certain bits of code. although you can't access marks based on a register without effectively writing a switch statement.there are many other limitations, which the game does a great job of guiding you though especially in the start. id say its easier since you have fewer restrictions. but id say the puzzles are better. less stepping through multiple programs at the same time to figure out sync issues - more thinking through different ways to solve the problem.also awesome intro music"
496,2559,"(Disclaimer: I've mostly been playing this on a DRM free version, hence the hours on record.)If you love (or even mildly like) puzzle games, and if you're even mildly interested in programming or ever though ""Gee, I wonder how one would write a code?"" Then look no further. Loosely based on BASIC, the game stars really interesting puzzles nested in an engrossing narrative, and is all presented with a  very solid UI that turns simple code into an active interface that helps visualize the coding experience. Even for somebody who builds software for a living, the puzzles can be quite a bit of a challenge. Though, it only makes it even more rewarding when you finally get your code to run, and have solved the problem elegantly.The 'Debugging Tools' (just a few options to test your code and see what it's doing line by line) are incredibly useful and provide the right amount of information to really step through things to figure out what isn't working and why. At first I wasn't a fan of the 'Zines' (pdf files that you can either just download or print for real on real paper), but as I got further in, I couldn't imagine this game using anything else. They provide helpful tutorials, rules of the programming language, and offer advice for further puzzles down the road. They're very well made, informative without being overly complicated, and just as crucial to the plot as anything that goes on within the game.Tl;Dr - This is easily the best puzzle game I have played in a long time, and hands down the best programming-centric game I've ever played. I can't recommend it enough, and RTFM."
497,2559,super fun!!
498,2559,"I am a huge fan of the Zachtronics programming game gameplay concept, but the thematic framing of why you solve all those puzzles has often seemed like an afterthought. I was honestly surprised by how well they addressed that major limitation from previous games here. The hacker story provides a reason to progress through the game beyond the satisfaction to solve every puzzle, and the puzzles themselves are elevated by being relevant to the story. Combine that with some of the best puzzles in the genre (where the competition mostly consists of the previous games from the same developer), and you have a truly special game on your hands!"
499,2559,"After TIS-100 (DOS, 70/80s style computer). Shenzhen I/O (electronic circuits, hightech company) here comes the next one: EXAPUNKS. The words I think of: Hacking, Cyberpunk, Computers, Freedom to do more than you were ask to.Here you got zines, which gives you some raw basics incl. examples like the other Zachtronic titles do. You have the tools, now it's up to you to test, learn to understand the EXAs and solve the problem. Despite trying to solve your task, you may also do more in your current hacking environment. Not for people who have no time, who are not patient or simply don't have the power to solve a puzzle for hours. If you like keeping your brain challenged then have found what you need in EXAPUNK and the other Zachtronics titles.As always, a new category of puzzle game with a nicely done material to provide some atmosphere and ofcourse, a story. Because of the design, the art & the puzzles which Zachtronics provides... they won my heart and made me buy most games with the confidence that I always can rely on a high quality and a very rewarding feeling after solving a puzzle. Keep it up, thank you Zachtronics!"
500,2559,Just a game that makes programming simple things cumbersome by forcing you to use extremely silly syntax.
501,2558,This game is about the journey not the destination but getting to the ending of the story felt so satisfying!
502,2557,"Me in Exapunks, after having played all of the other zachtronic programming games:""mov x t""INVALID INSTRUCTION...""copy x t""*ten seconds later*mov m fINVALID INSTRUCTION>:l Damn you muscle memory."
503,2557,The most immersive and interesting puzzle game I've ever played.
504,2556,"This is a Zachtronics game. Which basically means you write code, I mean not all zachtronics games have you write code, but technically that is what you are doing through a visual interface. The difference here is a little more wimsy and a little less soul crushing loneliness as you struggle in solitude against challenges that feel impossible. There is a pretty clear story, fun world-building and extras, interesting characters, and nice graphic design. The biggest complaint I have is that the coding language is way too simple for the game to be set in some future world. You don't even get proper for loops or the ability to store and recall multiple variables. You can't even use anything but integer values in code, strings seem to just be manipulable objects provided in levels and no other data type or structure is present than lists in files wothout index numbers. ALtogether this makes the coding annoyingly limited, and the challenges all the more devious. I hate this game so much I want to hurl my laptop across the room, but it hurts so good. The payoff is worth the misery, and lurking in a chat watching people talk about your hacking misdeeds is great. Back to bashing my head in trying to find a way to code a de bruijn sequence (look it up) generator in this game for fun."
505,2556,"Zachtronics has done it again. and honestly, this might actually be my favourite so far."
506,2556,I love the cyberpunk asthetic of this game and the coding puzzles are really fun. Really makes you think about how to get things done.
507,2556,TIS-100 on steroids
508,2556,"I can't remember the last time I worked this hard in order to play a game, but when you solve these puzzles on your own you feel like a fricken god.The lack of a proper tutorial is a real problem though. There are too many puzzles introducing new approaches, or simply requiring you to go exploring in files that are never mentioned, and in those cases I almost never manage to realize what's expected of me until I look at the forums, and that ultimately robs me of my self-taught victory.Aside from that, it's an amazing game. It'll beat you up, but it's a beating well worth taking."
509,2556,"Like Zachtronics other programming games, it has a lot of content and ways to solve the same challenges. Changes from other games include more interactive story telling, their best soundtrack to date, actor-based programming as opposed to discrete circuits or processor nodes.Runs perfectly on Linux."
510,2556,"I'm only a handful of hours into the game, but have truly enjoyed it so far! The hacking theme is fun and keeps things intersting. The programming language is simple enough to grasp, but adds its only layer of complexity when trying to optimize your solutions to use one fewer cycle, line of code, ect.  Seeing that a friend completed the same puzzle with a more efficient solution is fun and encourages you to think about solving problems in different ways. The puzzels can be challenging, but they are equally rewarding when you complete them. I wish more of my friends played this game, so I had more scores to compare against! The dialogue between missisions is kinda awkward, but it doesn't take anything away from the core gameplay.  If you have an interest in programming this definitely worth checking out!"
511,2556,Tons of fun but I hope you have lots of free time very hard game good luck
512,2556,I always love games from Zachtronics it is a developper that I will purchases most of their games.This one is an assembly like programming 'EXAs' that you will try to move data around or change data.It is really nicely done and the puzzle are great to solves.
513,2556,"This game was my Goty 2018, In short I think this game would appeal to anyone fascinated by the activity of trying to understand how something works so that you can 'break' it to do something else. The browser game Untrusted is also a great game in this genre too. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Take Hacking as figuring out how things work and making them work in different ways. This isn't a hacker simulator like uplink or hacknet or other games in that genre, but in many ways its a much more real hacking game. Firstly the setting is fantastic - a 1980s alternate future. 1980s a time when the 2600hz captain crunch wistle was discovered by phreakers, bbs systems were taking off, and hacking was a counter culture movement. Magazines like 2600, really do read like the zines in this game. The chat system, an AI character called ember and various friends of Moss (Your character), really keep the game rooted in this world. Every virus you sucessfully run, changes an aspect of the Exapunks world, and it really helps with the story and immersion. The levels themselves are super. Each has a super varied settting from hacking your body to help stave off the phage, to banks, universitys, and many more. When working on a level, you probably will come across a number of small problems to solve within it. These problems are very unique to each level, requiring thinking outside the box to overcome the challenges. Like other Zacktronic games offer many different ways to solve them. with metrics to see how you stack up against other people. The learning curve of puzzles is good - giving you ample time learn all of the different commands and some of thier various uses. That is not to say the game is easy though, at times it can be challenging but not fustratingly so.  Exploiting all the systems!"
514,2555,"t is what it initially feels. You write code in an language vaguely resembling assembly in functionality while being much more approachable. Anyways, it is a very enjoyable puzzle game and I heavilly recommend it."
515,2555,If you know assembly programming this game is a mind warp of fun with an intriguing story. But damn the assembly language is basic af. Wish for and/or logic at least. Gotta get creative. But it's fun!
516,2555,[Assembly language course flashbacks intensify]
517,2554,"I can't stop coming back to this game to optimise my designs, super enjoyable."
518,2554,"The game constantly makes you alt-tab out to read the manual, instead of having information integrated into the game. Yeah I get it's retro, it's also annoying as ."
519,2553,"Zachtronix Industries is one of very few ""must buy"" developers. They make programming-inspired games. In this case you have cute little robots that follow links and manipulate files and sorely wish they had more registers to store values in. Zachtronix is repeating their physical goods introduced in Shenzhen I/O: You have PDF of a hacking magazine/newsletter that you are encouraged to print and bind. Several problems refer to articles in the zine. ""So 512 means room 805 , file 201, starting at offset 20 - easy!"" [not]If you want a game with complex enough puzzles that you are distracted at mealtimes because you just thought of a way 2 of the EXAs might cooperate with a local link instead of a global one ---- then here you go!"
520,2553,Recommended to anyone how like coding challenges. This game is basically a collection of great coding challenges dressed up into an extremely amazing aesthetic.
521,2553,i thought from the preview video this would be a cool little coding type game but no this is a puzzle game disguized as a hacking game cause from what ive seen (if you like genuine hacking games like uplink etc) this isnt for you
522,2553,"For the longest time, I wanted to love Zachtronics games, because I love logic games, but each of them had little flaws for me. Some were too hard, and some were too easy. Some of them required me think really spatially in a way that I found annoying. Others had artificial limitations that made me upset because I just wanted to finish the level and get my teeth into a new puzzle.Exapunks has none of those problems for me. It's the perfect puzzle game: hard, but not so hard that I get frustrated and it's not fun anymore. Some of the later levels are extremely challenging, but a little perseverance and patience wins in the end. I enjoyed each of them, and none of them were so gimmicky or challenging that I was glad to be done with them and move on. Instead, I enjoyed them and felt accomplished.I've completed the main story levels, but I suspect that there's a lot more playability out there to optimize and get better rankings. I wouldn't take my timing (15.8 hours) as a good manifestation of how long it takes on average to complete the main campaign. I didn't spend any time playing the mini games or reprogramming the game it gives you, and I have a background in coding, so this game was a bit easier for me to pick up than it might be for other people. I could probably easily dump 40 more hours into the game to get my solutions more optimized for speed or size.As far as the logic goes, I'm really impressed by the ingenuity of the programing language in this game. Its really a lot like some of the languages Ive had to use throughout the years, and its general enough that you can use some of the tactics youd have to use in real life coding without getting bogged down with weird semantics and rules. Its really easy to pick up and memorize, even if you have little to no background in programming.Speaking of memorization, you dont actually have to do so, because the game comes with nifty documentation that gives you a cheat sheet of all the commands in the form of zines. I really loved the 90s cyberpunk vibe that even the documentation committed to. I never thought a puzzle game with coding elements could be really atmospheric, but this one actually is. The characters and AI are really interesting, as is the story. I like how the game draws you into the story and makes the characters believable and unique, yet it all still has recognizable archetypes of the cyberpunk genre for those who like that sort of thing.If you enjoy logic puzzles, I think youd like this game, even if youve never played Zachtronics games before or had any background in programming!"
523,2552,"There is only on problem with this game. Steam can't track the accurate amount of hours played. People asked me during lunch: "" Is everything ok? What are you thinking about?"" - ""Exapunks"" I replied.My favourite Zachtronics game so far!"
524,2552,"Come for the hacking, stay for the "
525,2552,Quite possibly the best programming game ever. Challenging in just the right way.
526,2552,Pretty dope.
527,2552,One of the best programming games I have ever played. Zachtronics has outdone themselves once again.
528,2552,I have to print out a magazine?  What year is it?
529,2552,Another perfect game from Zachtronics. They really can't seem to miss.
530,2551,"This game has so much depth it's incredible.At the start you can do the basic challenges and play FreeCell.Then you unlock PvP scripting challenges, and a full CHIP-8 style VM to program and share games on.The perfect game for programmers.Between this and The Return of the Obra Dinn, it's great to see so many creative puzzle games."
531,2551,"Oh neat, another Solitaire game."
532,2551,"I hacked the peanuts out of peanut bars, 10/10"
533,2551,Another amazing Zachtronics game. Get this if you enjoyed TIS-100 or Shenzhen I/O!
534,2551,"The first Zachtronics game I beat in a few days after it out, and spend hundreds more hours in it. It's basically based on SHENZHEN I/O and TIS-100, but the REPL command which let you create more EXA runtime make it pretty much different. Optimizing your solution is still fun, although it could get tricky when you pursue the best possible, Feels great when you think outside the box and get the trick."
535,2551,Great programming game.
536,2551,"I've played all the other Zachtronics programming games and Exapunks is an order of magnitude better than all of them.Gone are the arbitrary per-module code size restrictions, and instead you are given a per-puzzle limit. Want to make one giant Exa with a hundred lines of code, go for it. Want to split it up into ten smaller Exa(s) instead, go for it. Want to have an Exa that splits into other Exa that then split into even more Exa, go nuts.This seemingly small change makes a world of difference to me, as I grew so sick of fighting module sizes in Shenzen I/O I ended up quitting the game.Add on top of this better art, story, and overall presentation than Shenzen I/O, and you end up with this masterpiece. I cannot recommend Exapunks enough."
537,2551,"If you like the previous Zachtronics games, then this one is for you.This one is a bit like a mix between Shenzhen I/O and Opus Magnum. There is the assembly like language with your usual registers and I/O, however this time you're programming these EXAs to move through networks to perform various tasks, similar to the arms in Opus Magnum."
538,2551,Zachtronics has an incredible handle on games that make learning basics of programming fun. Exapunks in particular also nails the atmospheric cyberpunk story that takes you to the near future of 1997!Expect a steep (but rewarding) learning curve if you're completely new to programming.
539,2551,One of the best game of its genre.It's a bit more accessible than other (great) games of zachtronics (like TIS) for non-computer nerd but it still scratch this itch for computer geek really good. :)The story and immersion is also a bit more polished than the previous games from Zachtronics.
540,2551,These Zachtronics games just keep getting better.
541,2551,"Exapunks is another excellent programming game from Zachtronics. It is more compariable to TIS-100 than others, in that you do have to write code in a pseudo-language, but it is similarly easy to learn with a lot of tricks. Taking its vibe from the hacker subculture, you write code for virtual ""bots"" to manipulate themselves through servers and devices to get and add data or other effects (like hacking ATM machines). As with most other Zachtronics games, there is no one single right answer, you're given typically more than enough space/code to make non-elegant but working solutions, but there's always the challenge to reduce the amount of code, time to execute, and other factors, shortcuts that become essential in later challenges. And as usual, you're able to review your performance with your friends and global leaderboards. There's also unique hacker battle challenges that can pit your code against another player's, akin to old Code Wars, to see which algorithm better completes an objective.The devs have provided more than enough puzzles with a good learning curve, but it helps that Exapunks also has Steam Workshop support for user-added puzzles. There's also a Gameboy-like virtual gaming device that you can program for in the same language, of which people have also made unique games for as well. So there's a lot of puzzling to get out of it.Basically, Exapunks is another solid release from Zachtronics, and probably the first involving direct programming that is more accessible for those that are not normally programmers."
542,2551,"I recommend this game to everyone who likes programming or wants to learn it (although it is always tough to grasp it and this game only makes it easier by providing motivation). Compared to the other Zachtronics games involving code this one is even more accessible to amateurs. However, it is not dumbed down or anything as real experts (not me) can still take better advantage of the games' commands and rules to create advanced solutions. After solving each puzzle, you can see how you fared compared to your friends and the rest of the world. Those interested in it (I sure am!) can then tweak their instructions to improve their ranking.I like that all instructions are documented and usable from the beginning (the only exception is a handy shortcut, but it does not change what you can achieve, only makes some solutions a little bit easier to write). You will learn to make the most out of the available instructions and find new ways to tackle problems with ever increasingly difficult tasks."
543,2551,Good game if you want more tis100 and shenzen-i/o
544,2551,"Zachtronics does it again with a challenge to our brains worth taking. Lovely concept, ingeniuos coding mechanic, true brain-busting objectives."
545,2551,"Programming meets puzzle game in this great cyberpunk hacking world of tiny robots carrying out assembly code and passing data between registers to subvert the many computer systems the game has to offer. Presented in a great 'hacker os' that took me right back to the fun I had with winamp skins in the 90s, and leveraging zine culture as the tutorial and reference manual for the game is another great touch. Full of charm and super rewarding if your brain works that way. Would definitely recommend."
546,2551,Like TIS-100 and Shenzen I/O but better.
547,2551,Come home from work and work some more while also having fun! One of the best coding-puzzle-games around.
548,2551,Another version of their previous games. I like this genre a lot
549,2551,This hardcore assembly game continues Zachtronics excellent series bringing new features that make it the best yet.
550,2551,"Exelent Game.I just love puzzle games where many solutions work, it really challanges your creativity and persistancy to solve problem.s"
551,2551,"I'm not a coding fan, but it was awesome, especially idea with magazine. Cyberpunkish piece of art."
552,2551,"Zachtronics does not fail to deliver on their unique brand of quirky and technical games. The design in this game is stunning with a pseudo-assembly language wrapped inside of a unique take on a cyberpunk world. As per usual for Zachtronic's recent releases there is an awesome 'zine' you can print out that both serves to flesh out the world and as a hand resource for the game's puzzles and hacks. Play this is if you enjoy programming in assembly, want to learn, or are in the mood for something very challenging and technial."
553,2551,"Authentic 90s experience, 10/10"
554,2551,"A truly challenging puzzle game with a heavy focus on efficiency. Excellent timesink, really gets you to think hard"
555,2551,This game really does infect you so that even when you're not playing it you're thinking of how to optimize some old code or the best way to do the next one.
556,2551,I bought this game to git gud. I am still not gud. I r8 8/8
557,2551,Write viruses to attack networked systems. Optimize them to perform better than your friends. And then create your own game for a gameboy-like device in the game. Such meta.
558,2551,"As a computer science student, I find it really great to introduce yourself to Assembly programming. Lots of fun."
559,2551,"(Edited 9/20/2019: Fixed typos)Yet another amazing programming puzzle game from Zachtronics!Between being set in an alternate cyberpunk version of 1997, all the references to 1990s hacker culture, and the usual Zachtronics gameplay which often makes you feel utterly brilliant upon solving a hard puzzle, this game ticks a lot of boxes. The (sometimes super-subtle) references to things like the movie Hackers and 2600 magazine hit me with a wave of nostalgia.The game comes with PDFs of two issues of an underground hacker 'zine, which serve as the manual, and cleverly tie in with the game itself in that you're actually given the 'zine in the game, and it becomes a driving force in the story.I got one of the last ""Limited Edition"" upgrade packs, which came with physical versions of the hacker 'zines from the game, and other items... Which is when I found out they are the exact same physical format as 2600. (I even have 1997 issues to compare against!)Speaking of story... There's voice-acted cutscenes where a lot of the story takes place, and they're a lot better than I would expect from an indie title of this scale.  I'm more used to voice acting on super-indie titles ranging from 'lackluster' to 'make-your-ears-bleed'.  But in the case of EXA PUNKS, it's perfectly good voice acting and that's a welcome surprise.A lot of story tidbits (As well as helpful tips!) are also delivered via a chat system on your computer's desktop, and it's a nice touch.The EXA system adds a new dimension to the programming puzzles of Zach's previous games like TIS-100 and SHENZHEN I/O, and it's a worthwhile addition for sure!The game is fun as anything; the occasional frustration of getting well and truly stuck on a puzzle is balanced with the feeling of that ""Eureka!"" moment when you figure out what to do... And then the feeling you get from improving upon that solution for the third time.The addition of multiplayer, in the form of hacker battles against AI opponents as well as people on your Steam friends list, just sweetens the deal. (And the first venue for these battles is a pretty clear reference to Hackers, so that's pretty awesome for us '90s nerds.) You don't even have to worry about making time to play against a friend; it's asynchronous multiplayer. You're basically going up against their current best solution. Like racing against their ghost in Mario Kart.The graphics and sound are also fantastic! The graphics are super-clean, have a great aesthetic, and look amazing, especially at 4k! The sound is really something... You can hear cars driving by on the rainslick street outside your character's apartment, and I often can't tell whether it's actually the game or real, haha...Bottom Line:Pros Another Zachtronics programming puzzler! The story and setting are deliciously cyberpunk. Definitely the pinnacle of programming game evolution after TIS-100 and SHENZHEN I/O Challenging but never impossible. Leaderboards, multiplayer, and custom puzzles add lots of replayability. Great graphics and sound! It even has a Game Boy-esque handheld you can write games for... In anaglyph 3D!!!Cons Not really for non-nerds. If you're easily frustrated, this'll drive you nuts sometimes. Will mercilessly eat countless hours of your time. I wish there was a lot more!Edit: Autumn 2019. Game continues to be awesome. Rock on, Zachtronics!"
560,2551,If you like Human Resource Machine you'll like this
561,2551,"Great game, and just in time when I learn about turing machines.This is another good title with hard puzzles from Zachtronics, and I'll recomend to play it."
562,2551,"Great Game for people who like to employ their brain and spend a few minutes or even hours with a single puzzle. And mind you, you won't be spending all that time to solve the problem it will be perfection you'll be going after hour after hour after hour XD"
563,2551,"If you've played other Zachtronics games, then you'll like this one."
564,2551,"In this game, you're presented with a problem, including requirements on what the end result should specifically be.  The challenge is in meeting those requirements with a limited set of mechanics.  Zachtronics games nearly stand alone in this genre.  I write code 9-5, M-F, and still managed to stay up way too late for days working through the stages.   The soundtrack is good, and the story adds a bit of flavor, but the real fun is in the puzzles."
565,2551,"If you liked the previous games, you won't be disappointed."
566,2551,Good programming puzzles with more fun options and fewer frustrating limitations than shenzhen i/o. I liked the weird alt-90's sci-fi story and printable 'zines (which I recommend printing if you have a 2-sided printer).
567,2551,"Brilliant game, mind-bending puzzles and a beautiful syntax."
568,2551,Great atmosphere. Interesting puzzles.
569,2551,"I'm too dumb to be good at this game, but I've loved every zachtronics game so far."
570,2551,"Really loved going through the puzzles and solving them only to come back and try to make an even better solution.If you played another Zachtronics game before you will very probably love this one too.If you haven't you should give it a try if you like logic, puzzles and programming."
571,2551,"I think the best review I could give for this is that after playing it with a friend and discussing some of the challenges at a work social, we got some over-50 non-gamer engineers interested and playing.  Now in between workflow automation and DSP engineering we'll get the occasional ""Okay how are you traversing a network of unknown depth in fewer than 50 cycles."""
572,2551,Puts TI-100 on steroids and dresses it up with an engaging set of story missions and challenges
573,2551,This game is too good for us. 2018 doesn't deserve this.
574,2551,"The only reason I bought this game is it's a Zachnuts game. One minute in I've got a cut scene which isn't in Zachnut's games so I'm like, WTF, but I click the mouse a hundred times and aparrently I have diabetes and need drugs that cost $4M to stay alive. I don't care at this point and want to kill my character but I can't because you can only push one button and it doesn't say ""Suicide"".Then I;m sent to an Amazon Turks mockup and I stare at it for 5 minutes trying to figure out where the code goes before I realize I'm just supposed to copy the f'ing reciept. If this weren't a Zachsucks game I would have refunded there.After that I'm presented with another cut scene that I don't know what happens because I just turbo slammed the mouse button then I'm presented with a button that OPENS A PDF! So 30 minutes into this Zachfuchs ""game"" I'm still reading a PDF and the game isn't even open.Oh, and I'm just learning you can't cut'n'paste from the pdf to the game.And I had to leave the game running in the background for 3 minutes just so I could write this review.It also takes like 2 minutes to load the game so...."
575,2551,Very cool game! Fun puzzles.
576,2551,Another great game by Zachatronics!
577,2551,Fun times with weird assembly.
578,2551,"Another great Zachtronics game. If you know their other works, you're in for more of the same, which is good. Exapunks has some multiplayer and several level creators for post-completion funtimes."
579,2551,"Another  Zachtronics game? Yes, please."

584,2551,Excelent puzzle game. Interesting Esoteric programming language. Great for fun / getting some low level coding and multy treading practice / making simple games for the REDSHIFT (yes the game contains a virtual Game Boy for with you can develop your own application)
585,2551,"Oh boy, a new game from Zachtronics where I get to hack my own body.I really love this game, threw 35 hours in it in the first 2,5 days, before taking a break since it started to feel too much as work during my vacation.I will go back and finish it, stopped at synchronised sending out pager messages, though it is mostly done. I just needed a break."
586,2551,Finally a Zachtronics game with no program lenght limitation!
587,2551,"I'm a programmer by trade so this may put me in a slightly different demographic than most gamers, but I really loved this game. You basically write simple assembly instructions to make little robots navigate a network. Making a solution that works isn't too hard, but making one that works within the limits and as fast as possible is where the real fun begins. In typical Zachtronics style you can see your performance vs. everyone else and try to squeeze a few more cycles out of your algorithm. Also check out the subreddit where people use ridiculous strategies to improve their times."
588,2551,Standard Zachatronics game and a refinement of the previous programming puzzle games.The Zines are serve as a much better tutorial than the documentation in the previous games.Starts of easy but ramps up the difficulty very fast.
589,2551,Great puzzle game a must have if your are interested in programming
590,2551,"One of the best rogramming games, but not for the faint of heart. This is much closer to reall programming than most of this genre of games, but the physical representation of programs and servers is an iteresting twist that makes it stand out from the crowd."
591,2551,A great puzzle game and introduction to the kind of thinking needed to program.  Really a blast and the way they used the zine within the game was great as well.
592,2551,"Solid Puzzle game, great work once again."
593,2551,"If you like zachtronics games, you'll like it. If you are programmer, you'll like it. If you like puzzle games, you'll probably like it."
594,2551,"This has been the best Zachtronics game yet; the puzzles are interesting, and the distributed mechanics naturally lend themselves to optimization. None of the goals of this game feel artificial, and it's restrictions don't feel restrictive (no size limits!) Overall, a great buy.The storyline's a bit trite, but the world-building is stll great."
595,2551,Best Zachtronics game so far!!I specially like this game programming language. Not so limited than previous Zachtronics games. Much more fun to code... I think this game is much easier for those who aren't played coding games before.
596,2551,"A pleasantly approachable programming game, even for non-programmers.I've spent several late nights engrossed in the puzzles -- writing, testing, and re-writing my code -- and there are few gaming experiences like it (outside of the other Zachtronics games). Successfully creating a working solution from scratch is deeply satisfying. Since these are open-ended programming puzzles, there is no one correct solution (although some solutions are much more efficient than others; there are optional high scores/histograms, for competitive folks).The in-game visuals are beautifully polished and eye-catching. This extends to the fictional zines as well, which not only teach the programming language, but also help to flesh out this cyberpunk vision of the late 1990s. The music is catchy but not distracting: an excellent accompaniment for one's programming flow state.Especially exciting for creative types is the inclusion of a fictitious gaming console, the TEC Redshift. Players can learn to create and share their own software for the Redshift.All told, this game is more than just a series of sandbox puzzles; the creator has taken great care to craft a quirky, intriguing world inside and outside of them. The result is a slick, stylish, and enjoyable experience."
597,2551,"Welp, its a Zachtronics game, with all the brain-busting goodness you can get from it. I didn't think I would lose sleep trying to write a virus in assembly-esque, but I did."
598,2550,"I enjoyed the other Zachtronics games, especially TIS-100, but this is by far my favorite that they have made.It is the first one that manages to achieve a real sense of immersion -- the world that they have created for you to explore between the puzzles is fairly compelling, and the story is developed enough to serve as an incentive to complete the puzzles rather than simply as a background or setting for them.The programming aspect ""feels"" like real coding to a greater extent than previous games.  There is enough processor power thrown at you that things like data structures, graph searches, sorting algorithms and so forth become possible.  It has most of the challenge and potential for real 'flow' that actual programming does, just without a lot of the annoying details that go with real life software development.The general asthetic is probably the best part of the whole game.  It is a really cool alternate late 90's universe, and it kind of grows on you.  Enough that I felt that sense of loss at the end that you normally feel after finishing a good book and leaving a convincing world."
599,2550,"Once again, Zachtronics delivers a great programming puzzle.This is possibly the easiest entry point as far as the ""assembly-style"" programming puzzles by Zachtronics goes; you have a decent amount of space for each program, and you can instatiate multiple independent programs to run in parallel, which can provide some extra flexibility in coming up with solutions for puzzles. The puzzles have a nice variety to them as well, which means you're always going to be challenged at least somewhat to come up with a good solution."
600,2550,"as per usual, zachtronics continues to iterate and refine their own formula, while still managing to keep things fresh"
601,2550,+1!!!
602,2550,"I just nominated this game for ""most fun with a machine"". The game revolves around programming small machines to hack banks, pizza places and government networks. Watching the machines obey you and solve the brain-hurting puzzles is really rewarding. The setting for each challenge is both interesting and fun, with eye for detail. Can recommend for anyone who wants to have a stab at programming, for anyone who already loves programming and for anyone who loves puzzlegames."
603,2550,Excellent game that is equally challenging and entertaining. Only downside is that the girlfriend thinks I'm still working...
604,2550,If only real life programming was this fun.
605,2550,"As always great stuff from Zachtronic, If you enjoyed their previous game you will enjoy this too."
606,2550,"Probably the most accomplished Zachtronics game to date. Embodies everything that has made previous efforts so compelling, and improves in almost every aspect. Probably the most accessible of the programming-themed Zach-likes (the others being TIS-100, Shenzhen I/O), but that doesn't mean it isn't challenging: Finding a working solution isn't too hard, but optimisation is where the real fun lies (if that's your thing)."
607,2550,A lot of fun tinkering with the pseudo ASM the game uses.The atmosphere is a lot more developed than in other games of the studio and it's quite refreshing.Competing with friends to get the most optimized code is very fun too !
608,2550,One of the best games about programming.
609,2550,It good fun. Me hackey.
610,2550,"Oh baby, Zachtronics keeps on delivering. If you liked TIS-100 and SHENZHEN I/O you'll also like this."
611,2550,The worst part about catching the phage is that now you gotta optimize your own demise.
612,2550,"As another Zachtronics puzzle game following the legacy of TIS-100 and SHENZHEN I/O, EXAPUNKS is another captivating programming puzzle game that's extremely enjoyable to play. EXAPUNKS kicks it up another notch from previous titles, including voice work and ""cutscenes"" that help to create a story. While the puzzles can sometimes feel like a tedious exercise in memory management that's already been thorougly beat to death with TIS-100 and SHENZHEN, they still have enough new challenges to make the game fun and rewarding. While I hope this is the last Zachtronics programming puzzle game to use their limited register assembly language trope, and we see some higher level programming puzzles from them, I would highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys programming and logic puzzles."
613,2550,Best programming game from Zachtronics to date.
614,2550,Just like every Zachtronics game. A puzzle game that has you write a program to complete a specific task. In this game you program robots to infiltrate networks for you. If you are into programming or just puzzle games in general I would recommend this.
615,2550,"I like all Zachtronics games, but I feel Exapunks has the greatest feel, as it presents itself as a hacker game with actual programming, excellent challenges, mini-games, replayability with the possibility to optimize previous solutions, multiplayer challenges, a high coolness factor, and even the chance to improve personal progarmming skills as thinking of the best algorithm to solve a certain problem may even shine through to real life problem solving skills.  Two thumbs up and then some.  A must buy for all, who like puzzles and programming.  It takes a bit to learn the ropes, especially if new to programming, but there is hardly a better starting point than this."
616,2550,"Great atmosphere, fun puzzles"
617,2550,Another good game from Zachtronics.
618,2550,"Just what you would expect from another Zachtronics game, plenty of programming puzzles to solve wrapped up in a new and interesting disguise that makes it even more fun and interesting, with interesting story and characters thrown in to keep you wanting more. This time some of the characters are even voiced which greatly adds to the experience :).As with any of the Zachtronics games I highly reccomend this :)"
619,2550,"As always, Zachtronics released a great gameWould buy again"
620,2550,Exapunks provides a new trist on the Zachtronics formula through self-replicating computers. There are many solutions to any given problem and the puzzles lack the space constraints of TIS-100. This game scraches the same itch as Shenzhen I/O.
621,2550,"Programming, programming everywhere !!!"
622,2550,"EXAPUNKS is an excellent puzzle game for programmers, with some solid story & world-building - it *really* sells its alternate history well, and, to my knowledge, no other game on Steam has DIY in-world zines that provide the game's tutorial & instructions.  Zines.  Plural.  That you actually *print out and bind*.It's a lot to get into if you're not a programmer and/or new to Zachalikes, but if you've played other Zachtronics games (like Shenzhen I/O or the TIS-100), you know what you're getting into - it's a logic-heavy puzzle game about writing Assembly programs, where ""READ THE MANUAL"" is mission-critical advice.In my experience, the puzzles can be a bit obtuse at times - there are some edge cases the manual doesn't explain, and the in-game level info box assumes you know what you're doing, when, in fact, you don't.  In those cases, there's not much to do but look up a level walkthrough, or experiment until something clicks.  Protip: if a compass of sorts showing link directions (e.g, to the left is 800, to the right is -1) is shown on the edge of a level, it's telling you how to connect to different hosts based on the direction you want to go in.  While it's fairly obvious for an actual 4-way compass with north marked on it, there was an earlier level with the same style of connection info that left me stumped for a few days 'till I tried ""LINK 800"" on a whim and found it let me connect, despite there being no numbered labels on the pathway.I wouldn't recommend EXAPUNKS to everyone - assembly is unforgiving and tricky to pick up, even if it's a simplified scripting-language version - but if programming puzzle games like Shenzhen I/O, the TIS-100, Human Resource Machine, etc, are your jam?  It's worth picking up.  If you're on the fence, wait for a sale."
623,2550,"If you like Zachtronics games, you should be buying this already. It is the easiest of their line of puzzle games but it is the most accessible, the most polished, and has the most side content of their games. The real challenge mostly comes from the limited number of registers on your EXAs (if you don't know what any of that means don't worry you'll understand as you play). It still has the annoying thing of needing the manual as you play to look up instructions and other things but that's a minor gripe."
624,2550,"Excellent programming-based ""hacking"" simulator. Creates something new, entertaining, and rewarding in an arguably crowded genre. Zachtronics never fails."
625,2550,Fun little coding puzzler.
626,2550,"This is basically a game based on the movie Hackers. If that doesn't sell you on it, I don't know what will."
627,2550,"I've always preferred Zachtronic's more visual games to their straight programming ones, but this bridges the gap fairly neatly. Some of the extra activities aren't for me, but the core game is very clever and well-supported. Yet another cool Patience variation is a bonus as well."
628,2550,If you like their other games you will like this one.
629,2550,I have all the Zacktronics games.This one is awesome. My fave so far.
630,2550,Neato
631,2550,"I am simple man. I see Zachtronics, I buy."
632,2550,"EXAPUNKSYet another brilliant game from Zachtronics :)You are a hacker and you're task is to program EXA-s bots to do many different things in the network.Programming language is similar to assembler, but it's very plain and easy.Everything is very well explained in details in tutorials, how to program EXA's and use them later.Graphics is very nice.Music is also great.Very good job, Zach, as always!More cool games from Zachtronics: Infinifactory, TIS-100, Infiniminer (protoplast of Minecraft, yes!)In summary: must play!"
633,2550,"Zach's games just keep getting more interesting. I love the polish on this one. Good puzzels once again and guaranteed to keep you busy optimizing and figuring out all the hidden little bits in some of the puzzels.As with infinifactory (40+ hours) and Shenzhen I/O (9+ hours), TIS-100 and Opus Magnum, I don't expect to ever finish this game. Mostly because I'm not smart enough to solve some of the more difficult puzzels later on. But that doesn't detract from the many hours of fun I have with the ones I do figure out."
634,2550,"I find a bug in the game. The post in the community said:Bugs? Crashes? Email us!If you encounter any bugs or crashes, please email us (zach@zachtronics.com) instead of posting here. It's the quickest way to get your problem solved, and makes it easier for us to find it.I send the email with code and details. And I get this:You should post this as a question on the EXAPUNKS subreddit (https://www.reddit.com/r/exapunks/). Were at the point in the development process where this is far more likely to be a misunderstanding than an actual bug.WTF? You can test a bug by guessing?"
635,2549,Solving these puzzles makes me feel less stupid ... until  i see that histogram.
636,2549,"Well, Zachtronics gets better and better at this, I must say!Back then, when I first played SpaceChem I thought it can't get any better, but with each game (except that card-thing failure...) they prove me wrong! And I am glad to be wrong!A very clean and nice design and UI, interesting puzzles, lots of freedom to express yourself and experiment! The background music is just gorgeous, really puts you into ""thinking meditation"" state :) The dialogs with AI and inside chat include good sense of humour :) The RedShift game platform is just insanely fun to toy with! And as a bonus, this time PDF manual can be printed in different formats!And there are many other good things about it that I must have forgotten, because it is hard to keep track of all the great stuff in this game! The only *downside* is that puzzles are somewhat easier compared to previous games, but I put it in quote for a reason - not everybody enjoys figuring out how to implement basic arithmetic operations in assemble-like language as we did in TIS-100, so this game appeals to wider auidence, and for challengeing puzzles there is always workshop available, where other players will make insanely difficult levels :)So, to sum it up - 10/10. Very nice, polished game, do not be afraid of programming aspect of it, you can play it with 0 knowledge about programming, you can handle it! This game actually helps develop algorithmic thinking while having fun!"
637,2549,"It's a satisfying and challenging programming game; I like it a lot!The first half or so of challenges are pretty easy to complete, but it's harder to get a good score. Even the easy ones were fun because you could spend some time really optimizing your code. Some of the last few challenges are quite difficult, and I wouldn't be surprised if people unfamiliar with programming will take a very long time to complete them. If you're unfamiliar with programming, I think you should be able to complete at least most of the challenges, and you will learn the basics of programming in the process (but not any useful programming language). I am an experienced programmer, and it took me 31 hours to complete the main campaign.I also played TIS-100, and this is much more satisfying, mainly because the size limitations were relaxed. I know the whole point is to restrict yourself, but TIS-100 took it too far. It'd be interesting (though maybe insufficiently challenging) to relax the restrictions a bit more, even, such as by allowing you to broadcast a message to all EXAs at once or grab multiple files.The environment was nice, very authentic to the intended scene/era. But I found the actual story a bit underwhelming.9/10"
638,2549,"I like hacking games, and have played quite a few. I also like puzzle-programming games, like the ones Zachtronics usually make, and have played quite a few of those as well.Exapunks is both a hacking game and a puzzle-programming game, and it is the only Zachtronics-game I've finished so far - not because it is easier, but because it has been so much fun I haven't been able to stop playing."
639,2548,"I'm loving this puzzlegame. You don't need to be great at programming to play it. The language is made up (although a bit similar to machine code), but the idea is simple. You need to write a program that can manage any test. So there aren't any shortcuts. Just try your way forward.One puzzle took me four hours to complete. When I checked the next puzzle it was an even harder one.I'm writing code and trying a couple of solutions about a couple of hours each day. Seems to do the trick."
640,2548,"Another amazing zachtronics game that tickles the logic/programming side of your brain with great puzzles.I've enjoyed many zachtronics games, and I'd have to say that I think this is my favorite one, yet. The difficulty curve was absolutely perfect, the classic zachtronics print-outs were on point, as was the not-overly-complicated, but still interesting lore, and of course, the puzzles themselves were great in variety as well.Most levels will force you to use a new tactic or trick which you (likely) haven't used before, which makes it so that every level really feels like you're solving a whole new challenge, and not just playing the same level with a twist many times. This keeps the game extraordinarily fresh and interesting throughout, which was really my main complaint with most previous zachtronics games.There's plenty of room (and no pressure) for improvements in code for every level, in a way that you actually want to go back and re-do levels in order to optimize, so instead of the levels themselves being repetitive, simply replaying the levels can provide as much replay-ability as wanted.If you like programming/working through logical problems, this is hands down the best game I've every played for that particular genre. Would highly recommend. Zachtronics really hit it out of the park on this one."
641,2548,"I'm flagging this as 'not recomended', even though personally I think it's mostly excellent. Why? Well: I think your mileage will vary considerably with this game. It won't teach you to code if this is your first experience of it; but if you've got some coding experience already you may well enjoy it. For those who do know what they're doing with software, quite often the path to a solution will be obvious. The challenge  is working out how implement that solution with a tiny instruction set and absurdly limited memory constraints. Individual EXAs (the things running the code) can typically only access two* values - X and T- one of which, T, gets overwritten with a 1 or 0 any time you do a test. A task like taking two numbers, comparing them, and then writing out the result becomes much harder than it would be in any modern language. You have to find workarounds, and new ways of doing things. These 'Eureka' moments are great when they happen (as I was typing the example above I thought of a really neat solution), but writing out the code again the second time becomes something of a chore. And you will be doing a lot of typing. And debugging is frequently painful, particularly when you've got 16+ EXAs executing things.In conclusion then: if you've not written code before, this is not the place to start. By all means try, but caveat emptor and all that. If you have written code before, you may enjoy the challenge that it offers- can you write code in the way it was written in the 1960s?If you are a professional software developer like myself, you'll almost certainly enjoy it, but at times it will feel like you've taken work home with you, and you're not getting paid for it, and you probably won't be putting it on your CV. *two other registers are also available contextually- F and M- but they have their own headaches associated with them."
642,2548,"(I have 20 years of IT experience, and have programmed in various languages ranging from assembler to high-level. This review is subject to change, since I am currently at the radio station challenge, though the rating flag itself should not change)I remember the 1990s quite well. I was running bulletin boards of my own, as well as playing door games on Spitfire and Telegard boards. The culture I was a part of was separate from the real world. It was called cyberspace and we were called cyberpunks. I enjoyed the anonymity it offered, yet I was never a hacker though.In Exapunks, where the game's universe is in 1997, I get to play a hacker who is infected with the Phage, a disease that turns human flesh into useless computer circuitry and is terminal. In order to get the medicine that will slow the progress of Phage, I need to do work for someone named Ember-2. Despite the very human sounding voice that utters the odd ""Hmm"" and ""Huh"" Ember-2 is in fact an AI. The work involved is hacking networks, be it a pizza place, Berkeley UC, a highway sign, you name it, this game either has it or comes close to something similar.The tools I use to hack these networks are called Exabots, which are programmable viruses that look like little mechanical spiders. The programming language is a cross between COBOL and mnemonic assembler similar to Z-80A, which, after a few hacks becomes surprisingly easy to remember. KILL, HALT, COPY, WIPE ADDI, MULI, SUBI, DROP, GRAB..you get the idea.Don't worry if you haven't written a program in your life. You have access to Trash Magazine - a hacker publication and a VERY obvious nod to programming magazines like Radio Shack's 80-Micro - that will teach you the programming language and how to breach networks, access and change files, read data storage devices and repair your Phage-damaged body. Yes, as in your arm and heart for starters.Because the Exabots have limited storage capacity (basically registers), you can replicate additional ones to increase storage and perform parallel processing through inter-Exabot networking. With every successful hack the story advances. People you used to remember -- but no longer can because of the Phage -- come to your apartment to chat and check on you. Your own conversations with Ember-2 continue as well, and every time she utters something, no matter how friendly and matter-of-fact, you're left wondering what exactly is her agenda. She wonders how you feel about doing things for her in order to get medicine, yet at the same time muses about human behaviour being confusing and that there just doesn't seem to be enough disruption being caused. Oh yes, and her fascination in the inner workings of human physiology. The more you talk with Ember-2, the more unease you start to feel.The story itself is not the only thing that evolves. You also get access to other items like a portable gaming device and a Russian version of Solitaire. I don't know what else I can get access to, though I know you can make workshop challenges to share with other players to try hacking. I think you need to progress much deeper into the story before you unlock that but if I'm wrong, I'll revise the review and give credit to the person providing the correction.I needed to play this game for quite some time before I was comfortable enough to make a recommendation that was fair and balanced, and I recommend you buy this game for the following reasons.There's a surprisingly large and very supportive user community for a game that just started out of the gate. Chances are extremely good if you ask a question about the game in the Steam discussions, you'll get an answer and no one will make fun of you if you are struggling along.It's an excellent way to learn about programming if you're new. The language used in-game itself is not a real programming language but it has the aspects found in most programming languages...variables, arithmetic calculation, conditional branching, file I/O and parameter passing between applications. You can find out if programming is something you'd be interested in and it will introduce programming to you in a fun way.This next part requires some explanation. In some Zachtronic games, there is a workspace constraint on the solutions you come up with. In the case of Shenzhen I/O, it was the board size to place wires and chips.In TIS-100, it was a12-node programming area to write code.I always hated that restriction. Always. I felt like I was being asked to build a car within the confines of a coat closet. As far as I'm concerned, if you can correctly add two to two to get four each and every time, that's enough.Thankfully, there's no such restriction in this game. It follows the same design model as the more open Opus Magnum where the sky's the limit in solution size. Yes, if you exceed the number of lines allocated for code, your solution will not be included in thehistograms representing where you stand in comparison to other players, but your solution will advance the story. If you're okay with that omission, then all is good.The story itself -- as far as I've progressed with up to now -- is well written and engaging enough for me to continue playing. The challenges to complete will become more difficult as you progress, but it's nothing anyone can't solve without taking a moment to think it through. Suggestion: doodle out a solution with paper and a pencil first before writing the code. The graphics and UI are pleasing to the eye and streamlined enough to get to where you need to go.There are two nitpicks but not enough to matter. Treat it as a personal preference and not a genuine criticism.The first is the background music. It doesn't have the enjoyable etherealness of Opus Magnum's musical score. After a while it started to grate on my nerves so I muted the music. Apologies to those who like it.The second is the inability to access the workshop to create your own challenges to share with other pllayers until considerably later in the story. Shenzhen I/O and Opus Magnum allowed you to do this fairly early, but I am working on the radio station challenge and the workshop is still not unlocked. I wish it was unlocked earlier because the workshop can serve as a sandbox to play around in order to understand the mechanics of the game better in case you're not sure about something.A final point is the way data is exchanged between Exabots. I can either share data locally within the confines of a host on a network, or in the form of a global yell across the network. That's it. I cannot send data to a specific Exabot. That breaks a fundamental concept of networking. Just as an IP address identifies a printer, backup device, personal computer/server or communications device to send data to, I should be able to do something like:COPY 123 M:0to send the value of 123 to a replicated Exabot named Exabot A:0. I shouldn't have to worry about another of my Exabots grabbing the data before the intended target gets it. As I said, that's a nitpick and in one situation that had this, I found a workaround.I predict Exabots will be a runaway hit for Zachtronics, and good for them for the work they did."
643,2548,"Exapunks is an addictive game that uses coding as its main mechanic. This may sound intimidating or disinteresting to those who haven't coded before, but fear not, for I never have in real-life either. Yet, this game is very approachable for total beginners. The puzzle solving is open-ended, so your solutions feel like your own, not like you were trying to read the puzzle designer's mind. The aesthetic and storyline are great--a sort of alternate-reality 1990s. The game also features a number of mini-games, as well as a built in way to design your own little games using the simple toolset available. It mawy sound intimidating, but building a functioning game is easier than some of the puzzles you face. You can also share these games with others. Overall, I highly recommend this game."
644,2548," https://www.blognone.com/node/106197EXAPUNKS is a successor of SHENZHEN I/O and TIS-100, and there a lot of improvements ever since. The puzzles are more versatile than just solving to advance the campaign. Now you can directly compete with your friends on head-to-head hacking mode! Or you might enjoy writing new games on your own!And now the restriction is almost vanished (like in Opus Magnum). Write code as long as you need to complete the level, then come back at any time to optimize it. Shake off your worries that Zachtronics = Impossible Puzzle Game."
645,2548,"This game is fantastic!!  Once again Zachtronics has developed an unique game that blends the elements of general programing principles and pure gameplay.  Keep up the good work and can't wait for more of these ""intellectual"" challenging games."
646,2548,"A great game focused on programming. I really enjoyed it!Compared to Shenzen I/O, Exapunks has a bit more story with both voice acting and some cutscenes. The story is still by no means the primary focus of the game (the programming levels are where you spend 99% of your time) but it did adds some flavor between levels. Also compared to Schenzen I/O the limits on your programs is less strict, which I thought was a huge improvement to how fun the game was. In Exapunks it's possible to do a very sloppy solution at first and then improve on it, something that was harder to do in Shenzen I/O due to the space limits of the various hardware components."
647,2548,"delivered in a beautiful 90s theme, this title is for people who enjoy exploiting logic to achieve goals in a clever way by typing lots of simple commands to form complex systems.---XA---COPY 539 XSWIZ X 1 MSWIZ X 3 TSWIZ X 2 XMULI X 16 XADDI X M XMULI T 256 TADDI X T X---XB---COPY M XCOPY X M"
648,2548,Way less restricting than shenzhen-io. Almost as accessible as opus magnum. Great job once again.
649,2548,"Exapunks is my favorite Zachtronics game yet. Nothing between the problem and the goal but your own creativity and ingenuity. If you're my friend on Steam, buy this so I can play against you in the battle stages!"

652,2547,"I love programming challenge games, and this is simply one of the best ones out there.  For a while Zachtronics' games have been an instabuy for me, and this is one of their best games yet."
653,2547,"At this point, Zachtronics games are a masterclass in puzzle design - They are generations ahead of anyone else in how to present and structure puzzles such that they are approachable, but challenging without overtly overwhelming the player, or holding your hand and boring you.  It's so hard to do well and Zachtronics is just getting better at it.EXAPUNKS is a great entry in the Zachtronics games library that is significantly more approachable than TIS-100 or Shenzen I/O, but still delivers on the fantasy of 'Assembly' programming in a more approchable manner.  The art, the music, and the narrative all support it meaningfully - it's another piece of polish that makes these games great.In terms of dificulty, I feel right now that this game is easier than Shenzen, but harder than Opus Magnum.  The nature of writing code versus interacting with a moving, physical object almost necessitates that.EXAPUNKS represents the increasingly refined craft of Zachtronics as a studio.  It's the same thing, but better and different enough.  It's predictable, but is a welcome new addition to my library.  You probably already know if you'd like this game, but if you are on the fence, I'd encourage you to take a chance on EXAPUNKS."
654,2547,"Before you buy, know that you have to print out a 21 page manual to actually be able to play the game"
655,2547,Word class
656,2547,Zachtronics being Zachtronics!If you like the previous games or if you enjoy puzzles (specially programming puzzles) do yourself a favor and buy this!Thank you for the amazing experience *AGAIN*! :)
657,2547,"I love this game. I actually feel like it's beneficial for my job, and I only work with devs, not as one. Not only does it teach and/or improve your functional programming using a lean assembly code, it does this while exploring the current trends in software development - the cloud, distributed software architecture (modern websites could be thought of as running tens to hundreds of services/exas at the same time, communicating between each other with (M)essaging systems but running independently) and even some of the aspects of finally reaching human levels of complex machine intelligence.As far as the gameplay goes, Zachtronics has done a good job of combining a visual debugger with an IDE which you then use to perform tasks such as changing street signs or cooking doughnuts. Your head will hurt as your loops break, your code goes awry, and you iterate again and again. But it is a good pain and you'll definitely feel a sense of pride and accomplishment when completing a puzzle - or completing it better than before.PS. I think peanut blast is better without the peanuts anyway."
658,2547,"Don't have much time in this game so far, but in just over an hour, i finally completed the tutorial level's, bloody challenging but so rewarding, especially if you figure it out by yourself."
659,2547,It's pretty good if you're autistic and like working with logic.
660,2547,Write code to to simulate physic using virus like programs. :)
661,2547,Cyberpunk 1997
662,2546,"I started the game. I listened to all the tutorial junk. Then when I tried to run the code for the EXA, there was no button to RUN THE DAMN CODE! Poor design. I clicked on everything on screen. Nothing happened. Totally dissappointed. This looked like it could have been fun. I will never know."
663,2546,"You can actually optimize a solution by dividing by zero.Problem solving with incredible levels of creative freedom.  You feel a rush of accomplishment when you complete a level, because the solution you came up with was your own.  Don't be intimidated by the programming aspect.  You can do it.If you don't buy EXAPUNKS, at least get Opus Magnum instead.  When you experience the rewarding, creative gameplay of these open-ended puzzle games, other puzzle games will feel suffocating and restrictive by comparison."
664,2546,"Excellent open ended puzzle game. As usual with Zachtronics games, the puzzles themselves are generally pretty easy to solve if you break them down and take them piece by piece, but the open-ended nature and optimization puzzles mean that you can effectively make the puzzles as difficult as you want and also adds a ton of replay value. If you've played other Zachtronics games, the feel is very similar to Shenzhen I/O and TIS-100, but EXAPUNKS tones down some of the more frustrating limitations and adds new tools that cut down on some of the more annoying bits of figuring out how to move data around and let you focus more on doing big complex tasks as efficiently as possible, which is definitely a nice improvement. It's not perfect, but it's overall very solid. It's not for everyone, but if the premise intrigues you you'll probably like this a lot."
665,2546,Another Winnner
666,2546,It's a pretty fun game when you finally. get. the. hang. of. the. rules. The manual is very unspesific about how commands work and you kinda have to just try things untill it works. Some less immaginative people will be very frusterated.
667,2546,"I have absolutely no programing experience and have never played any hacking games before, but I saw some reviews on Youtube and was intrigued and it is a really great game! The tutorials introduce all the different aspects you need to know and other info is in the ""zines"" and it is challenging but not frustrating because you know what you need to do, you just need to figure out how to do it. Challenging and rewarding with the perfect balance of difficulty. Absolutely recommended!"
668,2546,Very good game :D
669,2546,Game is excellent. Dripping with atmosphere and nostalgia.
670,2546,"This game is superb.  The polish, puzzles, mechanics, voice work, art... it's just perfection.  I bought it yesterday, currently have 25 hours in-game, and can't wait to get back from work to keep going.I don't know if the core coding mechanic is really friendly to non-programmers, since I've been one for 30+ years, but the game is *clean* and the UI is terrific.  I'll be buying a copy for my son so we can play together as I teach him programming.  I've owned a number of ZachTronics games - SpaceChem, Infinifactory, Opus Magnum - and I've enjoyed them all.  But each one at some point got so complex or so tedious that I tapped out.  I will not be tapping out of this game.  The core mechanics are complex enough to be challenging, but simple enough that I can always find a solution - if not the best solution - with a little thought.  But even though the core mechanic stays the same, the different settings (ATMs, movie theaters, game boy, etc, etc) keep it feeling fresh.Hugely recommended if you program or love puzzles."
671,2546,Perhaps trying to prove that I can program!
672,2546,"Best Zachtronics game yet!Exapunks is all the fun parts of code optimization. There is a made up distributed programming language, there are lots of simply-stated levels with many ways to approach, there are three metrics to try to optimize for, and the debugging is very visual so it's easy to tell what's going on in your program. There is a lot of replayability, I'm 400+ hours in and still have plenty to do. When you first solve a level, you'll want to just get something hacky working. Then comes the part where you improve your solution - maybe you can split your code between two workers and speed things up 2x. The optimization has diminishing returns, you'll get the low hanging fruit first, and eventually you may get to a point where your solution feels very tight and hard to improve further. But then you squeak out another cycle or find a way to do the same thing in one fewer line of code and that is very satisfying.If it's something that motivates you, this game will definitely make you better at actual programming."
673,2545,"At first this game didn't feel like a hacking game as much as a programming of robots game. However, as I got deeper into it, the requirements to achieve the goals became more and more difficult and now it feels like a hacking game. Great atmosphere. I haven't finished this game yet, but I still recommend this game."
674,2545,Loving this game.I really appreciate the work and effort to create a step into the CORE WAR realm... THe story line is very cool and stylish - the challenges are very progressive and logical.Bravo to Zachtronics.IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS:I would love to see something more full-on... maybe different classes of warfareMaybe EXA upgrades with more registers (thats been the biggest pain point).Programming the game console is great but with the limitations to the instructionset and the lack of extra registers for page swaps makes it too challenging.Would also like to see more Macro depth - maybe true MASM-style.
675,2545,"I was expecting the game to have a more dinamical tutorial. Code writing is not that easy to learn all alone, and haveing to read a book in game with 22 pages explaining how to do it is boring, games are supouse to be interactive. I`m dropping the game in the 3rd tutorial, it doesn't follow my line of thoughts."
676,2544,"As usual zachtonics delivers an amazing puzzle game, building upon what they learned from TIS-100 and Shenzhen I/O. Whoever likes assembler programming should give this a go. Although the instructions and the processors have once again become more powerful,  for example with the addition of the division and modulo operations, this calls for some even more tricky puzzles, and they do get tricky.But with the available code space this is no longer a pain to beat if you just want to finish the game. The real headache comes, as always, but here in particular, with optimizing your code.With the much larger code line allowances it opens up a whole world of new possible solutions, making puzzles easier to solve in general, but harder to optimize. Finally you can even write as many comments as you want, which wasn't possible in earlier games, due to line and/or space restrictions.The only clunky thing that I wish they changed is that you can't rename your solutions from within the game.Also the manual, once again a very nice piece of art, is a pain to print. the pdfs are all in landscape format, which caused my printer to just print them on the top half of the paper, leaving the bottom blank.After rotating all pages, and printing again, i had to notice that the pages didn't quite line up to be put into a magazine format, with page 18 and 19, which were supposed to be in the center being the only page which was left printed on only one side.Overall an amazing game."
677,2544,"Went in with absolutely 0 programming knowledge but so far the tutorial and my first hack went well even though it took around 3 hours. I highly recommend this game to everyone like me, who wants to learn to think and solve issues like a programmer without the necessity to learn a real programming language right away. This is an awesome game and I'm totally hooked. I legitimately felt a little ""high"" after my first ""real"" hack, since this game made me learn and apply new knowledge in such a short time.Some recommendations for new players:I highly suggest you print out your Zine since you will be looking at it a lot! You should read the Zine up to and including the syntax explanations as soon as you get your first issue, only skipping the ""Ghast walks u thru it"" section. Then go for the tutorial and try to solve the first tutorial mission with Ghats help so you learn how to apply the syntax correctly. Starting with the second tutorial mission you should try to solve the issue yourself as best as you can do. If you need to resort to Ghats help, only peek as far as the next step so you don't spoil your learning experience. You should be able to solve tutorial mission 3 without any help from ghast. Read Ghats explanation afterwars, so you are sure you understand what you did. Ghats won't walk you through Mission 4 but explains how loops work in a general manner. I recommend you read his explanation since loops and ""if-checks"" (I'm no programmer so please forgive my wrong terminology!) are complicated. You should be able to solve this last tutorial mission by transferring Ghats explanation to the issue at hand. If you passed all that you are well equipped for your first hack."
678,2543,Absolutely Spectacular. Zachtronic's best yet. The most aesthetic game I've played in a long time.
679,2543,"This is one of the best Zachlikes I have played. At first I thought the EXA machines were quite limited; they have just two registers, one of which gets used up for testing conditions, and no memory. But they're powerful enough to solve a wide variety of puzzles, and the sort of parallel programming they force you to do is really fun to work out.On the other hand, I'm not necessarily happy with the leaderboards; I decided I just had to be the best, and spent more time than was fun writing code that was bad but just *slightly* faster or shorter."
680,2543,"Easy to get in to, hard to get good at. Plus, now you get two(+) minigames!"
681,2543,dialer puzzle goodtook me 2 exas and abuse of the fact that M blocks
682,2543,"Great! I like this much better than Shenzen IO. The concept of EXAs at first feels gimmicky and unrealistic, but the more I used them the more I realized how powerful and versatile they are. The puzzles are all very unique and intersting. I've found myself staying up way too late multimple times saying ""I'll just do one more"". There's some code battles in there too that allow you to try to beat your friends after you beat the NPC. They seem silly, but I think they actually work really well. There's really just a lot of effort that's been put into making great puzzles, and it shows.The music is good too. I especially like startup loading screen. It really gets you pumped up and in the right mind to start ""hacking"" :)One negative I'll mention is that the narative is pretty weak. There are awesome ideas there like hacking your own body, but the whole story just shows up as items in your inbox and it just ..lacks punch. I would like to have seen some cutscenes or at least just a slideshow or something. Like hacking your heart to keep it beating should be a really intense experiance, with narative wrapped around it. It shouldnt just show up in an email that says ""keep your heart beating"".But overall its a great programming game with masterfully crafted puzzles. I hightly recommend it."
683,2542,"I read an interview with the creator of Zachtronics about balancing puzzles and fun, he said that it's a difficult balance. Exapunks sides too much on the puzzle side and not enough fun. Infinifactory and Opus magnum are the still the most fun games by Zachtronics I think. And don't get me wrong, I loved those games, Infinifactory is perhaps the greatest puzzle game of all time (so far). It's really simple though. Typing low level code = not fun. Creating what works like code or a factory visually in 3d = fun. I can understand and do well in this game, but it doesn't look good to show off the finished product, it's not satisfying,  it's more like just doing a job. One saving grace is the story bits inbetween chapters which give it life and some jokes. Wanted to voice a second opinion since the game has 100% positive reviews recently. If Infinifactory and Opus Magnum are your favorite Zachtronics games, and you're not a fan of TIS-100 or Shenzen I/O, you mostly likely won't enjoy this game as well (though it is a slight improvement over those). On the flip side if you liked those games, you might like this one too. Not a big fan here. 65/100"
684,2542,"Coming from someone who found TIS-100 to be a bit too hard for me, I'm really having a good time with this game while still feeling challenged enough. The visuals are great, the code is sexy and simple, the music is catchy, and the storyline is good. It's definitely not a game for everyone, but it certainly is a game I'd recommend for those who crave that ""EUREKA!"" moment that will make you feel like a genius after you've sweat on this one puzzle for two days..."
685,2542,"Awesome game, great flavor, great story, beautifully hand-crafted puzzles that all feel so special and thought out. Love it, great work!"
686,2542,Another excellent Zachtronics programming game!
687,2542,Zachtronics game - this is all what you need to know to buy it.
688,2542,"Thumbs up because it is a quality game. but I did not liked it.I loved  SHENZHEN, this one I liked much less...  unlike SHENZHEN in which you had the combination of electronics/board design and programming (very simplified). this one is just about programing. it is very good at that, but if  your day job is programing, you may not like this game very much... It feels like repeating the same mind problems you have to deal with on a daily basis, but without getting paid for it nor doing anyhting useful. you may get to ""hack"" a piza store in here, but in the end, it comes down to appending one buffer to another.  it is a very challenging game (I never completed SHENZHEN and TIS) and you learn a lot. Buttom line: If you love doing job interview coding challenges,  this is the game for you.  but if you do, you are likely busy solving another one now instead of reading this useless review (:"
689,2542,"If colleagues at work yell at you for goto, this is the game for you."
690,2542,"Best programming game I've ever played. Tons of replayability, great aesthetics. Syntax is similar to assembly."
691,2542,"EXAPUNKS is an excellent programming puzzle game. It can be completed by those who have never programmed before, while still being challenging to those who have. The game containts printable manuals (it is worth printing them), stlyed as hacker magazines, that explain the programming language and details of some puzzles. After solving a puzzle, you can compare the efficiency of your puzzle to other EXAPUNKS players and refine your solution if you wish. Refining solutions and optimizing them to take fewer cycles or require fewer lines of code is one of the the most enjoyable parts of the game, and gives it replay value. The amount of content is well worth the price."
692,2542,Remember all of the jokes people made about Shenzhen Solitaire being better than Shenzhen I/O?This game also has solitaire and it's just as good.People aren't talking about it because the game around it is even better than the solitaire.I sank 50 hours into Shenzhen solitaire and I agree. That's how good this game is.
693,2542,"So many BASIC beatiful memories... I love it.People from Zachtronics and CD PROJEKT RED, this ""game engine"" should be part of Cyberpunk 2077, in a parallel way,  as the hacker minigame or something."
694,2542,Another great game that makes you feel utterly stupid!
695,2541,Probably one of the best games I've ever played. Enjoyed every minute. Can't say any more.
696,2541,"An excellent game, exactly what it said on the box and exactly what I was looking for!Thanks!!"
697,2541,I love this game. If writing code is your thing then you should try it.It's not an easy game or for everyone but damn it's addictive.
698,2541,"Another fantastic zachtronics game.Takes all the good ideas in TIS-100, reforged into an all round better game with its own great visual style.As with the manual in TIS-100, the printout ""zines"" are a great element and add a lot to the experience."
699,2541,Another fantastic zachtronics game.Much love!
700,2540,"(tl;dr I recommend, but the game gets very boring after a while)Exapunks is definitly a zachtronics game : it features the characteristic atmosphere and nerdy challenges you'd expect from a zachtronics game, as well as a few metrics to compare your solutions to those of strangers around the world.The central theme of the game is to hack your way into difficult challanges, using a peculiar assembly-like language that allows your little robots (or exapunks as the game calls them, hence the name) to move from room to room, kill other bots, multiply, do arithmetic, crash on invalid instructions ( which is very fun and also a source of weird optimizations ) and all kinds of fun stuff.Whilst I did enjoy the first part of the game, and whilst it is definitly worth every cent and penny, the levels get tough after a while -- though, but not for a good or a fun reason.[The following rfambling  makes sense if you have the rudiments of assembly]You see, unlike any assembler that has ever existed, exapunks have at most 5 registers and no stack; and in most cases you can really use 2 registers only( and no flags-- the T register is the flag.). So you fork and fork and write to files to get around that. [end of assembly rambling]After a while, the game seems to think a ""fun and challenging puzzle"" is to have you take the place of a simple word replacement/ file manipulation algorithm. Of course you have to alter files in precise ways, and can only hold one file at a time. So even files can't be used to work around the limitations discussed earlier.And of course, you must do nearly all levels to get to the next levels : it seems the game insists I must have my dose of chores inside the game so i may access the cool stuff, assuming there even is any cool stuff to unlock anymore.The few spoken cutscenes are nice, but most dialogue is written, and relatively poorly at that. I would have liked that some new instructions would be featured after a while, to expand a bit on the set that swiftly feels too spartan.My final review is very mixed. The game has a good potential, is very fun for the first 15 levels or so...But really, the potential didn't fuly reveal.The starting game is fun enough that i can recommend it for the first 15 levels. And after all, for the time I've played it and enjoyed it, a bad review would be unfair."
701,2540,"This game really redifines what puzzle solving can be. Unlike other games of this genre, the open solution puzzle genre, and even Zaktronic's other games such as Space Chem or Opus Magnum, this game really brings the task of merely solving a puzzle in the forfront. For other games of this genre, the solution might be obvious so solving it might not bring satisfaction, or you might spend an arduous amount of time optimizing for the leaderboards just to get satisfaction out of the solution. The fact is, EXAPUNKS strikes that perfect balance between freedom and limitation where creating a solution feels really satisfying. I have a love/hate relationship with games of this genre because there are times where I would obsess over the 'best' solution, even to go as far as calculating what the fastest possibility is. EXAPUNKS however, im just proud of sitting back and watching the solution work, no matter where my score hits on the leaderboards. The puzzles all pose a different challenge. And the great thing is that the story provides a good amount of context for the puzzles. The story isn't stupendous to the point of recommending the game just for the story, but the world building is good enough to to really give a sense of drive towards your goals. Overall, it's a really tough game. At the time of writing this, I spent 16 hours on this game. I didn't even finish it. That's a lot of puzzle solving. As with other games of this genre, it's not for everyone, but it's one of the best of it's kind."
702,2540,Zach++
703,2540,"Another winner from Zachronics.  The puzzles can make your head spin, but the endorphin rush you get from solving them is well worth the effort."
704,2540,Ctrl+Z works!!!
705,2539,"The previous zachtronics programming games were good, but the space limit on code gets annoying really fast, also making it impossible to have comments and structured code. Exapunks is much better because you can put comments on things and you can indent things to make it clear when things happen in your brain. Rather than trying to figure out what everything does when you come back to it, things are much clearer."
706,2539,"Full Review --   Curator Site Video Review: https://youtu.be/WVgwGy5BUdAZachtronics is my spirit animal of the video game industry. Theres something about Zach Barths games that make me really excited to play them. Ive owned every game hes put out on Steam. I still remember when EXAPUNKS was announced, I saw just the letters Zach based and got excited, so was that excitement warranted? Before we really dive in, I will say, this is an Early Access game, however, Zachtronics has published it as a Beta, in which the game is fully completable and should have almost no bugs. They are still working on minor fixes and getting community feedback, which they certainly have gotten. I normally avoid Early Access unless I have to play something for Humble Monthly Bundle, but for the fact that EXAPUNKS, as it stands, is fully playable and Id call it close to finished. Patches are coming and fixes are being made, but the main game is complete. As such, I feel like this is an Early Access game Im willing to review properly, and I dont think the game looks worse for it.As you start EXAPUNKS, its a little weird. You first meet someone named Nivas offering to get you drugs for your disease. You then start by typing in a receipt from an executive for their expense report. Its literally doing what Optical Character Recognition (OCR) already does for money, and its one of the few parts of the game where a big opportunity is missed. Its not a bad section and I like the idea that theres not a lot of ways to earn money but there are a couple of major issues I have at this point of the game.The story of the game starts by giving you the option of better and faster ways to earn money, to get drugs that you need for your sickness. The drugs arent available right now and their price is going to skyrocket soon most likely, so youre in trouble.My biggest issue is that you dont feel like you are in trouble. This is the beginning of the game, and youre doing the OCR for money. However, you only do a single receipt, so you dont get to feel the weight of the drudgery. I realize people would hate to do ten or twenty of them, but maybe two or three would work. Throw the player in after having done 6998 of these, so they earn the 700 dollars for medicine they needed, and then they realize they have to start over for the next payment and start the story there.The work the player is doing is rather odd as well. We have EXAs in this world, which are extremely tiny robots that can do anything even hack the human body. And yet we dont have OCR for companies or its cheaper to have humans do it? Maybe even have the player forced to look at a failed OCR to find mistakes so they could fix an issue with the data entry rather than doing data entry that weve had for a couple of decades if not more.Thats a somewhat minor complaint, the other complaint is that the game talks about this Phage disease which is a major plot point. The player has it and its supposed to be affecting his body. The game is sold on Steam with the promise that you not only hack computers but hack your body, and the reason you need to is you have this disease called the Phage. The problem though is much of the game is built on this and its an interesting idea, but its never explored or made real inside the game itself. You will use your EXAs to cure you of pieces of the Phage, but the problem is its curing things youre not experiencing. The game talks about not having control of your (left?) arm, but you never see it or feel it. The player is easily able to code, without any problems. There are also points where your vision is injured, and again you dont have any negative repercussions from this.This is just an opportunity thats lost, but the idea that Im hacking my own body to make myself better sounded amazing and had a lot of potential. EXAPUNKS just doesnt make it feel as interesting as it could, and I wish there was something more that tied me to the feeling of helplessness the game wanted to present. A cutscene, even a coding challenge where I had to do something that was a little frustrating for a piece, or a cool visual trick when Im having eye problems and can only look at the mouse cursor could have brought the problem to life. None of that happens though, you just have the Phage and then you fix parts of your body that doesnt change anything.These are really the big issues I have with the story. In the initial scene, you meet Nivas, a delivery girl who offers you meds. Soon after that, youll meet Ghast who writes a zine, similar to 2600, and Ember-2, a Computer AI. Each character is interesting, though Ember-2 is really the only character thats around long enough to have a lot of character development. The game tries to develop Ghast and Nivas as well as having a third character pop up, but the fact is theres really not enough time for the other two to have any development, and the third character, only appears for a single scene to set up a level, which could probably have been done with Nivas instead.Ember-2 though does get a lot of interesting development, but its a bit backloaded, the final three or four missions have a number of big reveals worth hearing, but it comes very late in the game.At the same time, Im talking about the story, in a game where the focus is on programming robots. If youre coming for a story, youll get an acceptable one here, but not one worth buying the game itself. You should be picking this game up for the programming, and the story is the icing on the cake. I am nitpicking the story because there are small flaws that really took me out of the experience, and could have improved the initial experience, but we should talk about the actual gameplay.Perhaps I should say gameplay in quotes, as Exapunks is a rather odd game. After the first level where you type in the receipt, you meet with Ghast, as I mentioned, and he hands you a zine. You can open this zine as a PDF or one of two printable versions. This is actually your instruction manual for the game. Its a rather clever delivery method, and I absolutely adore it.Inside the zine is Ghast walks u thru it. This is actually a tutorial for the beginning of the guide that takes you through the next four levels. The first two levels pretty much just require you to type in a solution in the book but also explains exactly what is happening, and its worth following if youre new to programming or just dont get it right away.The third and fourth tutorials are more focused on suggestions, trying to get you to figure out the solutions while teaching you the tools of the trade, communications between two EXAs, and loops and conditionals. After that, the game throws you in the deep end and there are no more hints, its time to actually code your solutions from scratch, and in reality, thats where the game is going to be for the rest of the levels.If you want to read more and see a final score, you can see the full review with pictures and video athttps://kinglink-reviews.com/2018/09/03/exapunks-review/.

There's solitaire as has become standard (Magnum Opus included), but also an action puzzler. If that's not shocking enough, there's also PvP (Punk vs Punk?). Haven't gotten to do any of that against real people, yet."
708,2539,"I've tried a couple times to get into Zachtronics games. I played Spacechem, and found it enjoyable, but I bounced off of it after only a few hours. I tried again with TIS-100, which I managed to get further into in spite of its spartan presentation, but ultimately I bounced off of it as well after only about six hours. Finally, finally, I've found the Zachtronics game for me. If you like hacking, programming, the cyberpunk genre, or feeling like a genius, this is the game for you, too.EXAPUNKS is a delightfully cyberpunk game about hacking everything. Set in the far-flung future of 1997, EXAPUNKS puts you in the shoes of a washed-up hacker who's lost their skills and is dying from a mysterious disease that turns the human body into junk circuitry. The medicine you need to survive is prohibitively expensive, and so you're forced out of retirement to hack various things on behalf of a mysterious benefactor known as ""Ember-2."" Unlike the previous Zachtronics games I've played, EXAPUNKS has more of a narrative focus. There are VN-style cutscenes with voice acting at critical moments, and these moments provide a believable context for the challenges you face. The setting is a wonderfully realized cyberpunk retro-future (though perhaps ""alt-history"" is more appropriate); the music, character designs, and mechanical designs all create a wonderfully atmospheric and lovingly authentic 90s cyberpunk experience. Perhaps it's because of the presentation and the narrative context provided, but the challenges you face clicked with me much more readily than they did in Spacechem or TIS-100. Much like TIS-100, you're provided with zines chock-full of setting information and mechanical tutorials, acting as both a game manual and as a narrative device for worldbuilding. Much like in TIS, you're using a faux programming language to solve problems, but the extremely tight limitations from TIS-100 are relaxed here. There are limits to the length of your code, but they're usually somewhat generous; most missions don't restrict the number of EXAs, your little automated execution agents that carry out your programs, you can use; and unlike in TIS-100, EXAs have two registers that can be read from and written to directly.A number of challenges in EXAPUNKS are multi-faceted; for example, one level has you accessing a library's ebook server, locating specific books based on their call number, copying the contents of the books into another file elsewhere in the server, and then deleting all of your EXAs. The call numbers, however, are different for each of the 100 trial runs that all levels require you to complete, so you're prevented from simply hard-coding specific solutions and are instead forced to create flexible, versatile programs that can handle a variety of situations. Thus, when you discover a solution and then watch your EXAs carry out your incredibly complex sequence of instructions, you feel like a genius. As with many prior Zachtronics games, EXAPUNKS features minigames. For you Shenzhen Soiltaire fans, a form of Solitaire is indeed present, though this time it's Russian-flavored. There is also a head-to-head hacking mode, where you pit your EXAs against another player's EXAs to complete specific objectives, If that's not your cup of tea, you could always play a few rounds of HACK*MATCH, or, if you're feeling particularly ambitious, you could even choose to program your own games using the development kit for the Redshift handheld gaming system. I hesitated to buy EXAPUNKS due to my prior inability to stay focused and stick with Zachtronics' games, but I eventually pulled the trigger, and I'm extremely glad I did. I haven't been able to put it down since I got it. Buy it! Hack the planet!"
709,2539,"At long last, he has finally done it - there is finally a Zachtronics programming game which is accessible to the non-programmer.There are many points of differentiation between this and the impenetrable TIS-100, and the only marginally less abstruse SHENZHEN I/O. The most immediately apparent is the visual element. Your packets of code are represented by little robots (EXAs) which wander about the environment, physically picking up files and manipulating them in accordance with your instructions. Much like Spacechem's waldos, at any given moment you can see exactly where they are and what they are doing. Why can't I interact with this file? Oh, it's being held by another EXA. Why can't I create another file? Oh, there's no room in the grid. I don't need to work out what line of code contradicts another line because I can see the EXA explode when it is unable to execute an instruction.Second is the robustness of the instruction set. Where TIS felt like trying to parallel park a car without a reverse gear or wheels into a space half its size, EXAPUNKS gives you the commands you need to more-or-less directly perform the tasks required. For starters, in the far-distant cyberpunk future, computational technology has become so advanced that you finally have access to all four arithmetical operations! Whoah! You can write loop sequences anywhere in the code, have the loops trigger conditionally or unconditionally, relay data to other EXAs through global or local channels, replicate an EXA with the child beginning operation at any defined point in the code, terminate an EXA's code sequence externally by killing it with another EXA, and much more. Again, like Spacechem, with a tiny bit of creativity you can implement de facto code chunks to limit the number of times a loop is performed or sync up your EXAs, and this is just the stuff that a neophyte like myself could work out. I'm sure that there are yet more powerful tools available to someone with a bit of experience. You also have immediate read/write access to 3 registers - they serve different purposes and only one offers unconditionally permanent storage, but this is a huge boost from prior games.Thirdly, the space you have to write code is now infinite (or at least, it will be in the next update). Not hip to extreme optimisation techniques? No problem! Your code can be as clunky and amateurish as you need it to be, and the only penalty for exceeding the size limit will be the refusal of admission to the leaderboards. Given how embarrassingly bad such code is, this is arguably a blessing in disguise. The game still runs through 100 permutations of the puzzle, so you can't just brute force a specific solution - you need to work out generally applicable code - but if you satisfy that sole criterion then you're golden.Finally, the reliance on mathematics is drastically reduced. I detest maths, and its prominence in TIS and SHENZHEN was a massive turnoff. Most puzzles in EXAPUNKS will only require the use of numbers to the extent that they can be used to direct e.g. go to host 800, grab file 277, find the 6th data packet within it etc. There are a few exceptions, but nothing that would require an understanding of much more than basic arithmetic. If I can do it, truly anybody with a couple of neurons to rub together can do it too.In keeping with the longstanding Zachtronics tradition of crap tutorials, the tutorialisation in EXAPUNKS is... actually pretty good, though that comes with a caveat. In the first four levels, the manual literally tells you verbatim what code you should write and what it does, line by line. The fifth level drops you off a precipitous cliff and demands that you use new commands in new ways. This is very frustrating, but if you RTFM you should be able to claw your way back up to stable ground. Thrice I was on the verge of asking for help on the forums, but each time I found that what I needed to know was in the manual - I just needed to read it several times over to achieve adequate comprehension. Every individual type of puzzle in the game (and there are many) has its own section devoted to explaining its intricacies. This is a level of assistance I have never seen before from Zachtronics, and it should be applauded.It is possible that the concessions to accessibility might leave some more experienced coders feeling a bit lukewarm - as a huge Infini/chem fan, I felt the same way about Opus Magnum - but the beloved histograms are still there, pushing you to voluntarily shave off an extra cycle or two. I'm not sure if I'll finish EXAPUNKS - it's always possible an insurmountable wall of maths could appear in the next puzzle - but at this point I feel I've seen enough of the game to say I've got my money's worth. I'd recommend this to basically anybody who is a fan of any previous game in the Zachtronics catalogue.Edit: Just finished it! Man, was that satisfying."
710,2539,I LOVE THIS GAME SAME AS MUCH AS OTHER ZACHTRONICS GAMES
711,2539,"Lol. Transcribe receipt. No.EDIT:Game is pretty fun. Well designed puzzles. So far not as labor intensive as prime mover. I keep wanting more instructions but that would probably make it too complex. But seriously, add a skip button to the intro."
712,2539,i see zach game i buy game
713,2539,"DISCLAIMER: Didn't beat the game yet. It's basically Yet Another Zachtronics Game Where You Write Stuff In An Assembly-ish Language They Made Up, after TIS-100 and Shenzhen I/O. If you liked the aforementioned titles, you probably bought this one already, then beat it, and then decided to read reviews because you were bored. If you found those games too restrictive, good news -  EXAPUNKS gives you more space to work with, not unlike their non-assembly title, Opus Magnum. Is it a bad thing? I'm not sure - once you figure out the kinks of the EXA [EXecution Agent] programming language, the puzzles stop being challenging and start being tedious if you just want to find a solution and move on, as opposed to furiously optimize to reach the tenth percentile.At some point I've realized this is all similar to an Operating Systems class I was doing for my CS degree, when I needed to manipulate some files with a Bash script in a specific way to get a passing grade. Considering someone else's review was complaining about the lack of a 'ls' command, I wasn't the only one who sees it like that. Did I enjoy it? Yes. Does that count as a puzzle? I'm not sure. On top of that, for a game about hacking you spend surprisingly little time breaking into things, everything is online and unprotected like a drunk teenager's wee-wee and you just wander around like you own the 'net, but that's just a nitpick, I suppose.Everything that isn't the puzzles themselves - the graphics, the music and the worldbuilding - is crafted well enough, and tailored to immerse you into the plot. The human characters are passable (the voiceovers rub me the wrong way though), but most of your interactions are with the mission control AI that gives you tasks while trying to figure out humans, with varying results. The in-universe manuals make a comeback and they're fascinating to read, providing bits of lore on top the usual tutorial stuff needed to figure out the kinks of the EXAs.Bottom line? It's good, with a caveat that you need to be the type of person who enjoys writing Bash scripts to manipulate files en masse. If you're not, give Opus Magnum a go instead."
714,2539,"Awesome.So far, the best zachtronics game in my opinion."
715,2539,"So far the best Zach code-writing game. Previous Zach games feels tedious towards the end, but this one feels just right."
716,2539,"I normally don't review games as I often don't feel that my point of view is needed. Exapunks however, is a masterpiece that needs everyone talking about it. Nothing else needs to be said. It's quite possibly perfect..."
717,2539,"Awesome game! My flatmate hated during the two weeks I played the game because I was never really 'there', always trying to figure out a puzzle in my head."
718,2538,really very good programming game!
719,2538,"Another great Zachtronics game! It's a programming one, as should be obvious.I find it keeps me engaged better than Shenzhen or TIS. Probably because the story seems more engaging, with cutscenes and the like. I quite like that, Zachtronics seem to just refine the formula to make better and better games :DThe challenge in my opinion (though I've done programming before) ramps up rather slowly too, which I don't consider bad, it gives you time to get used to the instruction set.My one point of criticism is as with any Zachtronics game, I'd like some overarching world to it all. This one does this more so than the other games did, but it still feels like jumping between menus more so than being part of a world. But possibly adding the features I desire would mean it is a different genre and not as appealing to the rest of the gamers that like this kinda game.Oh, and bigger leaderboards (or scrollable) would be nice."
720,2538,"A great game for fans of programming puzzles.Zachtronics return with a new puzzle game, which is in many regards very similar to their older games like shenzen io.The implementation of the code inside of moving robots keeps the formula fresh, since the gameplay becomes way more dynamic than that of similar games. Memory is very limited though, which makes it challenging to transfer and modify data.Even though story is obviously not the focus, the world around you is interesting and the game manages to create some tension near the end.All in all this game feels like the best game by Zachtronics to date and is a definitive hit for programming fans."
721,2538,I'm very much enjoying this challenging programming game.
722,2538,"TL;DR: While Zachtronics previous game may have been named ""Opus Magnum"" their newest gem ""Exapunks"" easily deserves the title Opus Magnum for being their best game so far. As of writing, i spend 34 hours on this game: More than my playtime for Zachtronics previous games (Opus Magnum, Shenzen I/O, Infinifactory and TIS-100) combined. If you like programming puzzlers this game is a must buy without any form of caveat emptor attached. Exapunks Exapunks is the latest game in Zachtronics niche series of programming puzzlers which earlier produced the equally great titles Shenzen I/O and TIS-100. Compared to the earlier titles Exapunks feels larger and more importantly more accessible thanks to some changes to the games design. Two major positive changes compared to previous titles were an increase to the amount of code one can write to solve a level and the possibility for parallelization by spawning more EXA's (The small spider-like bots you program). These two changes combined allow a lot more freedom while solving levels as each level now has multiple solutions (conceptually different solutions, not just slightly code). If you - like me - managed to get stuck in Shenzen I/O and TIS/100 for extended periods of time because you couldn't think of a solution that was space efficient things will be much better this time around.The in-game leader boards present in previous titles also make their return: After solving a puzzle a leader board is displayed which shows how efficient your solution was compared to other players. After all: just because something works doesn't mean it works well! These leader boards are a source of additional challenge for those interested: Trying and managing to figure out how another players design managed to be twice as efficient has a certain satisfaction to it. As a positive note: Unlike Shenzen I/O there are no unlocks during the game. So if someone has a better solution than you they made it using the exact same tools. Game Content As a game, Exapunks offers plenty of puzzles and - as expected of Zachtronics games - plenty of side content packed in a box filled with a lot of ambience and atmosphere. Put into numbers the game currently offers:  33 Levels 4 Hacker Battles 2 Sidegames 1 Redshift Level Editor 2 PDF Manuals Multiple cutscenes  Note that this list was quickly self-counted during Early Access and may thus be incomplete or change as time progresses. Levels, Levels and even more Levels The 33 levels in the game are storyline missions that provide a specific objective to be met by programming a set of EXA bots. The storyline itself is relatively simple but each level had a unique enough objective that it doesn't feel repetitive at any phase in the game. In addition to the 33 regular levels there are 4 Hacker Battle levels. Hacker Battle levers are two-player levels where each player program's EXA's to reach an objective while the other player tries the same thing (While trying to interfere with the other player). Initially these levels are played against an NPC and are just like a regular level, but after beating it they can be replayed against Steam Friends. A game within a game within a game... Zachtronics previous game Shenzen I/O had a minigame of Solitaire included that was later also released as a stand-alone. Exapunks continues this trend by including not one, but two in-game games as part of package. As before both are fully optional aside from a Steam Achievement. Aside from the unrelated sidegames Exapunks contains a level editor that allows one to create and share levels through the steam workshop. If previous titles are an indication, this is will likely extend the games longevity by a nice margin after its release. Besides the lever editor there is also the ""Redshift"", an in-game gameboy-like console. The Redshift is a sandbox game level without code limitations and without an objective. The interesting part is that it simulates a console including press able buttons which can be programmed using the exact same EXA's used in the game levels. As with the level editor games made for Redshift can be shared between players; In this instance trough an .jpg image that can be imported into the game. Game atmosphere and ambience As a programming game Exapunks had a manual - two, in fact - which are required to even understand the game. In this case ""Manual"" actually sounds like an insult as this is no dry document explaining the games rules. Both manuals are styled as hacker magazines containing not only an explanation of the game (EG: programming EXA's) but also articles with background information, (fake) advertisements and explanations for game levels written as if send in by another person who wanted it published. Also of note is the (fake) chat-box within the game. This chat-box contains fellow hackers who will chatter about after you complete a mission. This can be entirely random chatter, but also feedback related to your mission (Effects of your actions for example). While this is not a major feature it adds to the sense of immersion and atmosphere that this game has aplenty. No, i am not writing a sorting algorithm! I am busy checking pressure values on the centrifuges of a rogue candy factory in order to disable them in the right order! Conclusion If you actually read the entire review: Congratulations! Somewhere in the middle of this review i mentioned my in-game trouble writing compact code and i suppose that ""inability to be brief"" also holds true for writing reviews. In my defence Exapunks is a unique and very diverse game that simply had a lot of content to cover if one wants to mention everything. All in all: Great game, well worth a purchase and well worth writing over 5.000 characters in a review for."
723,2538,TIS-100: Rebranded Edition
724,2538,"It's another Zach-like, the latest iteration in the niche genre of programming puzzle games that also includes previous Zachtronics titles TIS-100 and SHENZHEN I/O. If you've played either of those (especially SHENZHEN) then EXAPUNKS will feel like a new variation on a very familiar paradigm.Game mechanics are fun and original enough, and the programming language is fairly easy to get into. You have a decent amount of freedom and flexibility in solving the puzzles, as the game places little arbitrary constraints on you. This makes it more accessible than SHENZHEN, which I personally found much more restrictive.The difficulty ""curve"" is more like a square wave. Like its predecessors, I've found that EXAPUNKS' puzzles lie in one of two possible categories: the ones I can solve immediately, and the ones I spend hours on. You either just ""get"" them, or you don't. Having said that, none of the puzzles are too frustrating to get though. The real challenge is in optimizing your solutions, but you can decide for yourself how far you want to take that.Graphics, sound, and story are all nicely polished and create a great retro-futuristic 90's atmosphere that's surprisingly immersive. Included minigames are cute, but not something I found myself opening the game for.Definite recommendation, provided you enjoy programming puzzles."
725,2538,Very fun programming game. It has it's own language to program eXa which are like tiny computer virus that can run around other computers. it is super nice and thematic.Took me about 20 hours to complete all the puzzle/programs.
726,2538,"This is one of the best Zachtronics games yet. This time around, your puzzle-solving ability isn't limited by how much code you can cram into a single processor, and I found the difficulty curve to be much more reasonable as a result.The atmosphere of this game is phenomenal. The soundtrack is excellent, and the story is presented through a combination of voice-acted cutscenes, interactive dialogue, chatroom messages, and the printable hacker magazines included with the game. It's rare that a game immerses me as much as this one did.If you've played other Zachtronics games, you know what to expect in terms of gameplay. Solve the puzzle, and then optimize your solutions to try to beat everyone else's scores. This game introduces a new puzzle type that directly pits your bots against your friends, enabling more friendly rivalry as you go back and forth trying to create an unbeatable program. The Redshift development kit is another brilliant addition that allows people to create games and send them to friends in the form of a cartridge PNG with the game data encoded within.I'll be actively recommending this game to my friends for quite some time."
727,2538,Amazing! Zachtronics keep pumping out one computer scientist wet dream after another - and they keep getting better and better. Exapunks is less constricting than it's predecessors and even boasts a thoughtful story. Highly recommended!
728,2538,"My first programming game and it is insanely fun. I have limited programming experience (a course here and there at university), so the levels feel challenging but fair with the information the zine (a flavorful handbook of sorts) provides. I am not sure I'd recommend it if you've never written any code before tho!"
729,2538,"I'd happily play Zachtronics games just for the puzzles, but I'm really liking where they are going when it comes to including story and world building. Some might say they're getting too same-y, but I think the focus on forking and network communication keeps this one fresh enough to be worthwile.Update: Many of the puzzles in this game are top tier. If you're worried that all the optimization will just be loop unrolling, don't be--there's some of that, but also much, much more."
730,2538,Another great programming game from Zachtronics.
731,2538,Zachtronics = Just Buy It! You know the drill...
732,2538,Great game.
733,2538,"Just perfect.I played Infinifactory a lot and Opus Magnum, but could never quite get into TIS-100 or SHENZHEN I/O.I love that this is pure logic, no rng, no technical skill, just pure sharp logical thinking is required to solve every Puzzle.This is very polished and can not be compared to other games released in Early-Access, as it seem s fully featured and is definetly already a lot of fun to play.The whole Setting and Story is on point and nicely complements the puzzles.My only feature requests (minor and mainly for workshop puzzles):-I would love to have a way to open the Zines ingame.-More customizability for Workshop puzzles, especially the max size.-Better view of workshop levels in the virtual network, or at least filter and search options for the list.Again, Awesome Game, everyone who likes puzzles or logic or programming: Buy it right now, it is ready."
734,2538,"I love every game Zachtronics puts out. They're always a day 1 purchase for me. I'm not clever enough to completely finish any of them, but their puzzles are engaging, even infectious, in a way that's very different from other games. I frequently find myself getting stuck on a puzzle and daydreaming about potential solutions and optimizations while I'm at work or laying in bed. It's a great feeling when I eventually open the game up and find out whether or not my ideas actually work.Edit: I actually beat it! So good!"
735,2538,Assembler with tiny robots. Quite some fun..
736,2538,"So first - I love this game, as I've loved all of Zachtronics products ever since they were just little browser games. I've bought every game they've released, as soon as it was available. With that said - I do think it's really ironic that a game that encourages (and requires) you to write efficent, tight code has such a phoenomenally long load time. It takes my laptop (intel i5, windows 7) about 5 times longer to start the game and begin playing than it does to do the same in Skyrim. I can't imagine what Exapunks is 'loading' during this time, it can't possibly have as many resources to load as a graphic-heavy AAA title. Will adjust my review when/if this loading issue is fixed.edit: Adjusted review to positive - issue not fixed, but this is a tremendously fun game. Perhaps the loading issue is just me, I don't see anything online about it."
737,2538,"Really good Zachtronics game. Scratches a similar itch to TIS-100 and Shenzhen, and then some."
738,2538,"I couldn't quite get my head around some of the puzzles in TIS-100 and therefore skipped shenzen i/o, but decided to give Exapunks a try. Exapunks is spot on. It hits a nice balance somewhere between challenging and nearly impossible. My biggest complaint with this game? I would've liked a few more levels. Let's hope Zach comes up with a next chapter or something ;)"
739,2538,Fantastic!
740,2537,"We are back to 'assembler code' puzzles, and with the following killer features:* Spawn copies of your process (that starts at given labels). I.e. write a single complex process and have it multiply into specialists as needed.* Hacker battles. Given a objective, your and your opponents processes are released into the same network. The possibilities for optimizing and second guessing are legion (and yes, there is a 'KILL any other process' command)It' already the high quality we are used to with good background music, printable manuals, small additional sub-games, possible out-of-the-box actions, (and artificial 'optimization enforcing' limitations (which _is_ a good thing))."
741,2537,great game
742,2537,hack your  half-robot heart into beating properlyffs stupid phage disease D:
743,2537,"This game is in early access. I have completed around 15 puzzles thus far and have not found a single bug. Had I found one, mind you, I would be more than happy to forgive it in the game's current state. But, as I said before, I have not found one. If you have played any of the previous Zachtronics games such as TIS-100 and Shenzhen I/O you will find the language slightly different, but after reading the included ""zines"" you will feel right at home. For those of you that have played those games in particular the learning curve is nowhere near as steep.I do not code or use computers for a living which does make the learning curve (and the game in general) harder. My solutions are often not the most elegant and for the most part resemble ""spaghetti code."" Regardless of my struggles, man is it satisfying to finally solve one of these puzzles. The thrill of seeing the marker for the current operation whizz through your solution without causing a catastrophic malfunction is truly inspiring. For me, this game is not easy, but I also recommend it with every fiber of my being. It will make you think hard, make hours pass and wish you actually knew how to code."
744,2537,"ingenious as always, if you like problem solving games, go for it. Some of the puzzle descriptions would need polishing a bit, (as the description of same special cases of some instructions) but overall, its almost finished game, you will most probably not spoil your expirience going for it in the EA phase. I am already looking forward to next game from Zach!After i have moved forward in the game, i am innerly torn appart, is it too easy? Its hard to judge, anyway, as several people stated before, this is the great thing where to start, if you are about to buy one of the Zachs games.OK, its not too easy :DAfter 32 hours,  i finished the game, am i done? Not at all, there is lot to be optimised. Overall, the last puzzle is really hard, but it could be solved, if you try hard.The only thing i do miss in the game is breakpoint, beside this, the game is perfect."
745,2537,"My favorite Zachtronics game so far. Still has challenges, but unlike Shenzhen I/O and TIS-100, you have a line limit of 100 in a node, which makes it much less frustrating."
746,2537,"Yet another great Zachtronics puzzle, but still... I expected a bit more.I got thrilled when I learned the game was going to be about real world systems breaches. What I was hoping to see were a non-linear story and an open world where you can scan networks and hack what you choose (and can). I expected rewards for following the white rabbit and discovering the unseen. Because in real world, there's no kind AI that's going to guide your every step and pay for it.Excellent game though, probably the best in the series. Would definitely recommend it to anyone new to the Zachlikes genre, but let's face it... the genre itself getting a bit old now. We need something fresh.As a Russian, I also appreciate the Russian-referring material. The  made me feel quite nostalgic.When chatting with the AI, it felt a little silly to have options that sometimes don't even change its replies, let alone have an effect on the story.To sum up, this game quite satisfied me as a Zachlike puzzle, but it left my thirst for hacking unquenched."
747,2537,"If i had this game when i was 15, today i'd be ruling the world"
748,2537,"So... at the start it's a bit cheesy stroy (for me atleast), but it still not eht main focus of the game. Art +Story +Voice_acting +++Scaling difficulty +++Game mechanics +++++++Syntax and all the commands are easy to pick up, such as assembler nature of it blessed with simplicity.And moments after that, there goes challanges, that are pretty easy at first, but never similar and boring.-------Also no lootboxes."
749,2537,"Compared to other Zachtronics games the language gives you more power, but the tasks involves more to compensate. You're still hacking around the fact that you have a very limited variable count, but for me it felt better/easier to think about and write. The theme and story also encouraged me a lot. The zines are very good."
750,2537,"Excellent programming game.Simple rules, with so many possible combinations (the beautiful REPL instruction!)If you enjoy this kind of stuff, EXAPUNK is a must play!"
751,2537,"If you enjoyed Shenzhen I/O, you will absolutely love this. There's a little more mood and story here as well as a slightly different take on programming."
752,2537,"Solitare and  vore , what could be better?Jokes aside, the most polished game and story in the Zachtronics line of products with plently of familiar mechanics from past games and a difficulty curve smooth enough for newcomers to enjoy as well. Plus there's not as tiny a space as TIS or Shenzhen to limit your code to, so I was almost able to be as reckless with my bad coding as I wanted to.8/8 - a wonderful experience as always  vore joke"
753,2537,This game reminds me how bad I suck at low level languages.
754,2537,"Yet another great programming puzzle game from Zachtronics.If you like breezing through games without having to think too much, or can't ever imagine something like code being fun, then this probably isn't for you.  If you feel that anything less than photorealistic bloodsplatter are graphics not worth watching, then feel free to bro out on some call of modern ops 9000.On the other hand, if you like a challenge...If you think ""heeeey... thats cool..."" upon hearing the phrase ""retro-futurist vision of the 90's""...If the word ""assembly"" brings to mind opcodes rather than IKEA......Then dive right in.  This game is worth far more than it's price of admission."
755,2537,probably the zachtronics game i have the most patience for
756,2537,"If you liked previous Zachtronics games, you will like this one."
757,2537,"(Despite being in Early Access this game is feature complete and mostly bug-free)If you: 1. like open-ended puzzle games2. occasionally dabble in programming3. enjoy reading cyberpunk novels like WIlliam Gibson's Neuromancer4. have a knack for japanse old-school home consoles...this game is for you. Zach again out-did himself. While being generally similar to TIS-100 or SHENZHEN I/O, EXAPUNKS allows for a bit more flexibility in solving tasks - (more) lenient to beginners who just want to solve the puzzles, high skill-ceiling for pros who aim for the top percentile in the leaderboards. A light but effective narrative (with 2D cutscenes and the occasional voice-over) is sprinkled on-top, Redshift (a programmable micro-console to make your own games), the async PVP levels and the two mini-games top off the whole package.These aspects make this the most refined installment in the Zachtronics library! Highly recommended."
758,2537,"EXAPUNKS does for the Zachtronics assembler programming games what Opus Magnum did for their graphics programming games: it gives you more space to write your programes which enables you to concentrate on solving the problem instead of being forced to work with the limited constraints. So if you liked the idea of Shenzen IO or TIS-100 but gave up because of the limited number of lines of code available, try this, it is more accessible.It also has lots of references to hacker culture, a zine like Phrack or if you lived in Germany, the Datenschleuder from the CCC, and a Neuromancer style cyberpunk story."
759,2537,"Lots of good hacker zine pages to leaf through. Lots of good code puzzles for a brain to chew on. Lovely characters, witty writing, cool aesthetic, jammin' tunes."
760,2537,"Played and loved all previous Zachtronics games. I think the developers have hit a peak with Exapunks especially in terms of the overall polish of the game (interface, graphics, sound etc) and also the actual game mechanics itself. Although they have released this as early access, as I mentioned above everything is already extremely polished and is a blast to play."
761,2537,One of zachtronics finest IMO
762,2537,"So this is going to be a complicated review. Do I recommend it? Yes. Anyone who's enjoyed TIS-10 Or Shenzhen I/O knows what they're going to get with this and it's more of that. There's enough differences between the three games for EXAPUNKs challenges to feel new and fresh, and as always there's the same depth you'd expect from a Zachtronics game where there's the 'just get it done' level and then the 'do it fast' level.I love the setting, almost ripped straight out of a William Gibson novel. The art and design of this thing, along with the story and the surprising addition of voice acting now... it creates a very atmospheric game. The design propagates into the puzzles, too, with each level having its own unique design and setting whether it's a bank or a shop or anything.It feels like this is the best of this pure coding Zachtronics games but... for me, I have to say, this isn't quite as fun as Opus Magnum was. I miss sharing those gifs on social media. I miss the visual thing. In hindsight solving problems visually is just more like fun and less like my job.Take this setting and combine that with an opus magnum style way of solving puzzles and you might have my ultimate game. This... whilst still brilliant and clearly the work of a team at the height of their powers feels perhaps too similar to what's gone before in terms of the basic gameplay.That story and that art though... yeah. I love it."
763,2537,wtf i hate concurrency now???
764,2537,"If you like programming, you are going to love this game.My only complaint is, so far I haven't had to account for any ""edge cases"" in the solution tests. Which makes it so your solutions can be simplier than they should have to be ;). A hard mode with edge cases added in the future would be cool."
765,2537,"Another great game from zachtronics. This is a low-level programming puzzle game, but a lot more approachable than TIS-100 or Shenzhen I/O due to a more flexible distribted processing model and engaging story line which gives what you're doing a sense of purpose. The manual for this game comes in the form of 2600-esque ""zines"" with a bunch of interesting stuff in them rather than dry technical documentation like TIS-100 and I/O. The game has a pretty authentic mid/late 90s aesthetic to it, which is pretty nostalgic for me since that's when I originally got into programming and the ""hacker"" scene.If you're into and interested in programming, give this game a shot -- it's a cool and fun way to learn about low-level programming. If you're not a programmer you're probably going to have a hard time with it, but probably less so than with zachtronic's previous programming games.IMO this is probably zachtronic's best game to date, and that's saying a lot because everything they make is gold. 10/10."
766,2536,Surprised I've never heard of this developer. I'm definitely getting more of their games. This is pretty fun. Getting lost in debugging my code. And the cool zines that come with it...kind of pissed my printer isn't working. Going to have to head to the office!!
767,2536,"You can make small processes called ""EXA"" in this game. Each EXA has its own task with two registers but the one register is overwriten for saving result of IF statement. EXA can execute add, sub, multi, div, and mod calculations. (Yes, fortunately you don't need to code multi, div and mod calculations by yourself using only add and sub this time.) EXA can create, read and write files but manipulate only one file at once. (This is my favorite part in this game.) EXA can send single value to other EXAs using a global or local channel. EXA can clone other EXAs. There are a lot of problems to solve and each problem is quite unique! The code line limit is 100. (Sometimes I can't believe I could solve a problem with this limitation.) There are two cool manuals. (I like this unique apploach to provide tutorials and tips for users.)I purchased a lot of Early Access Games. So let me say this is NOT Early Access at all.But I still respect the Zachtronics' decision that they think they improve usability and balance.Before I purchase this game, I thought the price is a little high considering TIS-100's.But after playing, my thought was totally changed. This game is very fun and worth its price.I can't wait next Zachtronics' puzzle game."
768,2536,"Exapunks is a beautifully crafted puzzle game and is easily the most accessible entry in the Zachtronics series yet. There's such a wonderful amount of depth that's not readily obvious at first glance; the EXA coding is dead simple to learn (but fun to optimize), you can tweak and improve your solutions to compete with others, have head-to-head hacker matches, immerse yourself in the universe's lore and even mash together a game on a handheld game console, then export it and share it with others! I mean how cool is that!"
769,2536,"it's a sequence of assembly-style programming puzzles, with some multithreading flavours.there is a story going on, which i mostly ignored  I got eaten by an AI, because she asked me to?...the last puzzle was a bit difficult."
770,2536,I don't even code and I'm enjoying this.First Zachtronics I've gone out and bought and I don't regret it
771,2536,"Amazing combination of programming and problem-solving in a game.I used to program a lot in my younger days. I also remember I loved the little assembly programming I did at uni. This game is an amazing collection of problems that can be solved by a kind of very restricted assembly-like programming. You can optimize the solution by fewest cycles (fastest), least number of code lines, or by least activity that the program performs.Everything is baked into a neat little hacker-story (I'm not finished with that story yet)."
772,2536,"Another awesome game from Zachtronics. The programming is slightly less constrained than previous games, which makes it quite a lot easiermaybe too easy? Still excellent though, and the new AI battles with such simple and constrained code are very very cool."
773,2536,"Zachtronics have really bested themselves this time.Lemme sum it up:Great puzzles as always.2 Awesome minigames. (I literally can't stop playing HACK * MATCH send help)Very stylish graphics.Interesting story with several characters, voice acting and crazy plot twists.Most flexible level editor yet.Fun achievments.10/10 worth every cent."
774,2536,"I'm a simple man. I see a new Zachtronics game, I buy.Honestly, this is probably not the best entry-point for newcomers. Opus Magnum and Infinifactory are prettier and easier to get into. SpaceChem and Opus Magnum have better music and story (not that anyone plays them for that). But if you're already into the genre, get it for sure."
775,2536,"Yep, it's another great Zachtronics game.  How does he keep cranking these out?"
776,2536,"Another Zachtronics game, what else do you need ?+ Great story so far+ Awesome graphics  and overall presentation+ Music well suited for concentration+ Cool gameplay, with interesting challengeWhile not impossible (so far, haven't finished it yet), it's certainly challenging, but in a good way :)"
777,2536,"Its good, I like it."
778,2536,It's a Zachtronics game. You know the drill.
779,2536,Another great Zach game. I'm sure I could have optimized this review more.
780,2536,"It's the 90s again, the golden age of the Zinet. In this game, it's an alternate version of the 90s. There are small bots called exabots that can traverse the electronic universe, read and alter data, cause power outages, realign satellite disks... your task is to program these exabots, sometimes to repair nerve connections in your arm or eye.The game is made up of puzzle levels. There's always a task to achieve usually without leaving a trace, such as making ATMs spit out 20 dollar bills and leaving no exabots behind. The problems are open ended, you just have to write code that solves the problem. There's always a way to improve, to make exabots solve the problem faster or write smaller code, or have less exabot activity.If you've ever played a Zachtronics game, you know what you're getting into. Unlike Shenzhen I/O and TIS-100 you aren't lacking in space to make your solultions. The programming language of the game is also a bit more powerful, so don't need to make up for the lack of instructions yourself that often. There's multiply, divide in game. There are new restrictions to deal with so there are worthy brain teasers in game.If any of this sounds good to you, you're probably one of the people that will enjoy it and I highly recommend it. Oh, and there's also a solitaire minigame that's quite nice and wholly optional."
781,2536,"It's like Shenzhen I/O, but with more story and none of that annoying digital I/O synchronization"
782,2536,Like Opus Magnum and Infinifactory another great puzzle game from Zachatronics. This time you try to hack yourself into various computer systems by programming little machines. Once solved you can spend even mroe time to fine tune the programs to take less cycles or to reduce program size.
783,2536,great game. much easier than shenzhen i/o. almost no cases where space (physical or memory) becomes an issue.
784,2536,"Im not exactly proud of myself, but I have been doing lines of coke, drinking white wine, and listening to hackers movie soundtrack while playing this game all sunday morning/afternoon.I definately 100% recommend this game, my only criticism is that zack didn't license enough music (the music there is, is great! there just is not enough!).. but thats fine, I just turn off the music and make my own playlist.."
785,2536,"Only a couple hours in, and I'm having a blast.Kinda similar to TIS-100 but with some graphisms, more flexibility and higher level code (more humanly readable).But it's also a different game, TIS-100 is good in it's own way and offert a different kind of challenge.Will update later"
786,2536,"Another excellent open-ended puzzler from Zachtronics!In this game, your task is to manipulate or hack various computer systems through the use of software agents called EXAs.  As with previous Zachtronics titles TIS-100 and Shenzhen I/O, this is achieved by programming in a language similar to assembly.  As with earlier titles, this is a game of programming within constraints: in TIS-100's case, the constraints are those of little space for code, few registers for storing values, and complex IPC arising from the parallel nature of the TIS-100 computer.  For Shenzhen I/O, again code and register space was limited, and there was an additional challenge of laying out the position of components in order to allow room for data lines etc.In the case of Exapunks, many levels have a limit on the number of lines of code in total which may be used, but those limits are not too harsh, and may be shared among as many EXAs as you like.  The limit on available registers is still quite constraining - you have one general purpose register, another which holds the results of test operations (but other than that may also be used for general purpose values), one to allow file access, and another for communications between EXAs.New EXAs may be forked from existing ones too, creating a copy  with the same code running in it.  As ever with Zachlikes, the puzzle design is magnificent, presenting a good variety of challenges and a fairly smooth difficulty gradient.Of Zach's games to date, this one has the most emphasis on story, too - an alternative 90s tale with all the requisite cyberpunk stuff: AIs, weird diseases that turn people into electronics, hacking, conspiracy etc.  As ever, some great supporting materials and documentation too.This is also the first of Zachtronics' titles to feature multiplayer challenges (competitive levels where you may try your best solution against those of others on your friends list in the style of a bot arena) and Steam workshop integration for designing and sharing user-made levels."
787,2536,"Exapunks is (currently) the pinnacle of Zachtronics Industries. This is an amalgamation of best sides of previous games and correction of their past mistakes. This game is no doubt the one I'd recomend to get acquainted with subgenre of open-ended puzzles. +:1) Difficulty - easy to complete, hard to optimise. Fans of Shenzhen I/O and TIS-100 remember how used language was quite restrictive (at least I felt so), however now you have FULL ARITHMETICS with THREE ADDRESSES. EXAs provide a lot of additional very interesting tools like replication, global and local shared memory, more functional (compared to shenzhen I/O macros). 2) Music - each track is perfect match with the gameplay and can be listened to outside the game without any loss of atmosphere.3) Pretty good tutorial - basics of language usage are finally shown via worked examples instead of remembering half of manual. 4) Setting and world - basically combination of sountrack, artstyle, plot and the most interesting part - local chat, where participants often comment on consequences of your completed missions.5) Manual - very cool, styled after self-published magazine and each part of manual has an article, often with a story from writer. It is interesting to read as a short fiction.-:1) Some parts of manual are not immediatelly clear (the disk part, for example).Overall it is a must-buy for Zach fan - be it hardcore bit-blaster, atom arithmetic specialist, involuntary production engineer, alchemy artisan or embed connoisseur. Puzzle fans should consider trying it out - there is a great chance you will like it. Even though it is great, open-ended puzzles are as specific as mockumentaries for horror lovers.  But IMO this is a game you should start with.Update: after first several patches the descriptions were changed to be more clear, so in the end all cons are null and void. After completing the game I can say that now it is a perfect puzzle game."
788,2536,Just finished the hacks covered in the first zine and received my redshift. Way more to go but I can already say that I absolutely love this game. The whole world and story are super intriguing and it's just so immensely satisfying when you accomplish a hack.Thanks so much for bringing this gem to Linux/SteamOS! <3
789,2536,"Really fun game, especially if you enjoy programming"
790,2536,Great game. The challenges are fun and the language is easy to pick up. Get it if you're into meaningful puzzle games.
791,2536,Reeeally good game.If you like pretending to hack and aren't an idiot.  You should buy this game.
792,2536,I'm dumb as hell but I still love it
793,2536,"Fantastic creation from Zachtronics once again. The premise is great, the IDE is really solid and it kept me hooked for hours. If you want to break away from the daily scrum and hack together solutions that'd make a game-dev cry, this is the game for you."
794,2536,"Zachtronics games keep getting better and better! The mechanics are always awesome, but this one manages to be a lot more immersive, surprising for an assembly puzzle game. There's an actual story and narrative and it feels a lot like there progression as you solve the puzzles, but the puzzles manage to stay extremely interesting.I think even non-programmers could get into this, but at its heart it's a puzzle game where you write algorithms to solve the puzzles. It's a niche that's very fun, but you have to be patient and have to want to learn all the unique rules for the algorithm language. It's like assembly, but even programmers who know assembly will have to read the rules for this one, and you still will have to experiment a lot. It's new territory for anyone, programmer and non-programmer alike.Overall, A++ puzzle game. Another amazing Zachtronics game, and so far my favorite!"
795,2536,"What can I say? It's another techy puzzle gem from Zachtronics. Early Access but already a great look and feel, interesting storyline, well-designed puzzle and systems for solving them. Haven't been disappointed by this developer yet. Strongly recommend if you like solving problems and love tech/coding.Here's a short first impression vid I did taking a look at the game and a couple of the tutorial puzzles:https://youtu.be/iRiSpoVMNLw"
796,2536,Another great game from Zachtronics!
797,2536,Get it. READ THE ZINE.
798,2536,"I've barely scratched the surface, but so far, it's like Shenzhen IO but with a much cooler setting, and less awkward restrictions on you. It's much more open like Opus Magnum - your tiny robot dudes can have as many instructions as you want! Awesome.And yeah, the setting. It's super polished, and we have voiced cutscenes this time, and you get to hack yourself a free pizza. LIVING THE DREAM!Also, thank you for adding the swear filter option!"
799,2536,"Zachtronics games just keep getting better and better. The constant refinement of this niche genre they have created is really paying off. The high level of polish, charm, and atmosphere is just remarkable. The only way I wouldn't recommend getting this is if you don't like programming puzzles. And difficult ones at that.This is much more than just a series of puzzles, though. Essentially, you are thrown into a hacking subculture complete with physical (print-outable) 'zines, lively characters and a story more interesting than it ought to be. Every detail is dripping with TLC. The humor is spot-on and the pacing is good. It holds your hand just long enough to get you going.Pros:+The whole experience is just awesome+The artwork and voice acting are second to none+The puzzles are very fun and very rewarding+The characters are likable and you really feel a part of this hacking subculture+The IRL 'zines are just icing on the cake; I can't emphasize this aspect enough - it just adds so much to the whole experienceCons:-While there is a lot going on, you have to fundamentally like solving programming puzzles; they say no experience is needed, but you definitely need to understand programming logic to get anywhere with thisAnother grand slam for Zachtronics."
800,2536,Zach you did it again you crazy bastard. You stole another few weeks of my life and made me happily pay for it.
801,2536,"Zachtronics never disappoints. If you liked Shenzhen I/O, you'll like this - and vice versa."
802,2536,"the best educational game ive ever played, teaches you basic (assembly not basic) programing while being complex and intresting puzzles with multiple solutions and workshop support gives endless replay value"
803,2536,V good.V fun.
804,2536,A natural evolution of Shenzhen IO gameplay but with the added polish of Opus Magnum.
805,2536,"In which you become a Reyvateil, but with control of microscopic magitek robots that you personally program instead of the magical singing and including a prohibitively expensive daily supplement instead of a fairly expensive quarterly supplement in order to not have electronics sticking out of your body killing you from inside. (And god knows if anyone gets the reference.) Luckily someone's got a reason to keep you alive; work for them, and they'll provide the supplement.EXAPUNKS is yet another programming simulator from Zachtronics, combining the good parts of Shenzhen I/O, Opus Magnum, and Ruckingenur II.Compared to the other games (especially Opus Magnum), the early story is a little thin. There's voice acting, though, so there's that. The programming language takes a little getting used to, especially if you've played a lot of any of their other programming games (for example, I keep going JMP when this language uses JUMP); but the curve isn't all that severe; the worst of it is probably remembering that conditionals are now linked to the same TEST command, instead of having multiple seperate commands, like JLZ or TGT. If you're new to Zachtronics, the game nicely gives you a tutorial to help you get used to the language and how the parts work. It's not going to hold your hand for long, though, and you will almost certainly need to reference parts of the included manuals to figure out certain things.While there's an upper cap as to how many lines you can fit into a solution, this cap is usually around 50 or 100 lines, and it's across all your EXAs in your initial deployment, meaning that you can usually eke out more space with loops and replications, or fill in space by unrolling loops. As with other Zachtronics, you're not expected or required to make a ""best"" solution - as long as it fits, put whatever works.Level progression feels nice; while the game adds multiple micro-mechanics to each of the early levels, with the exception of replication, they feel like natural extensions of the mechanics you already learned (for example, searching for a value that contains ""peanuts"" and manipulating it comes in handy a little later when you need to collect a string of values corresponding to someone's bill). I do kind of wish replication was touched on a little bit more before a level involving branching replication showed up, but it's ultimately a small complaint about a level I'm having a bit of trouble figuring out.tl;dr: Great for Zachtronics programming veterans, more generally accessible than TIS-100 or Shenzhen I/O (but not Opus Magnum)."
806,2536,"You know if you want this game. You already played every other Zachtronics game. You were browsing the new games on Steam, or you saw a post about it, or somebody told you about it. Your eyes lit up, and you checked the store page. You clicked the reviews, scrolling to see if the reason the game wasn't 100% was because somebody doesn't like Zachtronics games. (It was). You bought it, and played it happily ever after."
807,2536,Hack the planet! Hack the planet!
808,2536,"I mean seriously why are you reading reviews, you should already have this in your library!"
809,2536,"If you liked previous Zachtronic games, you'll love this one. Some of their games have been a little too complicated for me to be honest but this one feels just right, challenging but not impossible, so far at least, and a lot more compelling to me than there previous games. Best of their games so far in my opinion."
810,2536,"You need to hack to live. literally.And boy am i happy it's not yet another uplink/hacknet type of game. In order to hack you need to write assembly for your 'exas' which are tiny robotlike things in charge of doing the actual hacking operations like moving or writing to the files.The assembly part is similar to what you get in TIS-100 and SHENZHEN I/O. If you have never coded before you shouldn't worry! the coding part while pretty satisfying, is easy to learn. And there is a tutorial and a zine to get you started.The story is pretty interesting and there are visual novel style cutscenes. I am really digging the art style so far.Overall, if you have never played a zachtronics title, dont worry. this is a great one to start with."
811,2536,"I know that for a lot of people, SpaceChem will always sit at the top of the Zachtronics game pile. But for me, EXAPUNKS really is the (current) high-point of the Zachtronics library. Previous games from this developer have had some story, but only enough to convince you that you're not just playing an ""arcade"" game. EXAPUNKS combines the classic Zachtronics formula with a real push to bring the world that supports the puzzles to life, and it was executed beautifully.The TEC Redshift is absolute gem, and I think it will help make EXAPUNKS one of the most replayable and well-known games in the Zachtronics library."
812,2536,"This is quite possibly the dumbest puzzle game ever. Every puzzle is effectively, 'how am I going to code around the fact that I can't write strings to registers, declare variables, or have no cat/grep or if/then equivalent?' It's getting old, Zachtronics. Write a real puzzle game where solving the puzzle doesn't regard solving for not having any command line utilities since people punched holes in floppy disks."
813,2536,"Absolutely fantastic game, if you liked the previous Zachtronics games you'll love this."
814,2536,"After a few hours with the game i can say that It's really good, as I've come to expect from zachtronics.The soundtrack is awesome, the voice acting caught me a bit off guard, but it's good and the overall visual design of the game is really good.And the main part, the puzzles, if you have played previous games by the company you may find it a bit weird; TIS-100 had some severely constrained memory in each node, forcing you to optimize any solution.Shenzhen I/O had the workspace constraint that meant you couldn't route everything everywhere and work around the limitations.And Opus Magnum was a bit more free form, excluding the very last set of levels, with no constraints to speak of.In that way Exapunks follows from Opus in a good way, not having as many constraints as Shenzhen or TIS means that you can focus on getting the program to work before you think about optimizing, and that is amazingly satisfactory for a game that revolves around optimization. Besides that there are a few puzzles that I feel are out of place, making the game excruciatingly hard out of nowhere, and the progression of the game, where you only have a couple puzzles at a time to work with, actually makes the player get stuck on a level until they figure it out, which is usually when I pull out the zine and curse everyone even remotely close to me.Besides those nitpicks I've found that the game is really good and when I stopped playing to write this I kept thinking about the level I'm on and wanting to test out solutions, which is the important thing about puzzle games."
815,2536,"it's zachtronics, just buy itgoty"
816,2536,"Another great game from Zachtronics.Like many have said, this game is essentially a successor to TIS-100 and SHENZHEN I/O, with more focus on solving concurrent/parallel programming problems. The game's ""EXA programming model"" is an interesting take on concurrent/parallel programming, and it has been a joy learning how to appy it to solve problems.Also, the game has quite a production value, and feature substantial voice acting and visual novel style cutscenes. The game also feels more accessible than some earlier titles, so if you are new to Zachtronics, then this game might be a good place to jump in.And last but not least, the game runs flawlessly on Linux (Debian amd64 here), so again thank you Zachtronics for first-class Linux support!"
817,2536,"A highly polished puzzle game that should be quite fun for anyone interested in programming puzzles. The game is much more engaging than previous titles like TIS-100 thanks to loads of beautiful retro art and a more fleshed-out narrative. The game is still more complex than the likes of Human Resource Machine but seems significantly more approachable than something like TIS-100.Seems to work quite well on linux, too.As for a criticism, this game falls into the same stat trap as HRM. After completing a puzzle, you're presented with the number of steps your solution took and the number of lines of code you had (allowing you to optimize for space or for speed, as programmers are taught to do). However, some puzzles will have a specific solution that is highly optimized for one or the other. That solution tends to essentially rely on hardcoded exploitation. Each puzzle requires you to pass 100 randomized tests (like fuzzing tests) to make sure you didn't just hardcode the solution for the one specific problem you were given. But that randomization doesn't always go far enough to catch all the edge cases.Case in point, the puzzle where you have to empty the bank's ATMs. You're only allowed to empty one bill at a time from a given ATM and fail if you request something from an empty ATM, so the ""nominal"" solution averages something like 3000 cycles. However, the ""randomized"" tests never seed an ATM with fewer than ~30 bills, so the speed-optimized solution is to have two loops: one empties 28 or 29 bills in a row before checking on the counter and another empties one bill at a time, once the counter gets below 28 or 29. That drops the time to around 1000 cycles or so.  But it's clearly not representative of the spirit of the challenge (where an ATM certainly could have fewer than 20 or 30 bills).Similarly, there was another puzzle where the speed-optimized solution was just to copy and paste the same line many times in a row before entering your loop, as none of the tests required fewer than a certain number of iterations.Half of real-world programming is just error-checking and cautious code to navigate all the edge cases. It might be nice if programming puzzle games (after so many iterations) didn't allow so much latitude for overfitting solutions to the exact parameters of a given problem."
818,2536,"Terrific Game, Zachtronics have done it again!"
819,2536,"Great game - includes cutscenes (that's something rare in Zachtronics games), climatic simulation of chat and many hacking puzzles ;) Works great on Linux."
