Totally recommended.","The wobble and zoom effects hurt my eyes but can be turned off. The game itself has a pleasant difficulty curve and also offers optional difficult levels early on. Game is Good.","I think the best thing about Baba is You is that it relies on simple rules- that you can change the rules- and yet manages to provide you several different types of puzzles.There are a lot of puzzles which are quite easy and obvious. However, there are also the extremely difficult puzzles. The puzzles you'll get stuck on, and you'll leave the game, and you'll come back to it, and repeat it a few times before you get it right.Each of these puzzles is different entirely. The thinking you use for solving one puzzle can't apply to the next. The kind of puzzle it is changes.Best of all, this somehow makes this puzzle game replayable. Of the most difficult puzzles, I might solve it one day, and then come back the next day, revisit the puzzle, and have completely forgotten both the solution and the thought process that led me to it. I have to relearn that way of thinking entirely to solve the puzzle, only one day after having solved it in the first place.This game is simply a masterpiece.","Really interesting sokoban game about manipulating rules. It really gets you thinking about solving things in a very unique way: rather than \"how can I reach the solution state?\" it's \"what solution state do I want to make?\" There are a lot more levels than I was expecting!","(BABA) {IS} [GOOD]Baba Is You is a deceptively simple puzzle game. (BABA) {IS} [YOU] and you control [YOU] with the arrow keys on a two-dimensional field. All you have to do is get to [WIN]. Simple.The distinction, of course, is you control [YOU]. (BABA) {IS} [YOU], but what if (WALL) {IS} [YOU]? Well, you'll control walls. And if (BABA) {AND} (WALL) {IS} [YOU]? Well you control Baba and the walls. See, the properties of all the objects in the game are objects themselves, able to be pushed and manipulated by [YOU]. (LAVA) {IS} [DEFEAT]? Just push away the {IS} and walk across the lava. (FLAG) {IS} [WIN], but the flag is unreachable? Push in an object and make it (LAVA) {IS} [WIN], then touch any spot of lava to win the level.The simplicity of the concept, but the complexity of the interactions is what makes Baba Is You a great puzzle game. There's no obscure properties to remember, 'gotchas' of game minutiae that you'll only figure out by reading a walkthrough. The only thing to really remember is you move [YOU], and all other properties are subject to change, stated at the start of each level. You could go away for two months, and return to Baba Is You and still have a good idea on how to solve the puzzles presented.The ability to change the rules is why (BABA) {IS} [GOOD]. But the interactions is why (BABA) {IS} [GENIUS].For example, you may not be able to change (WALL) {IS} [STOP]. It's pushed against the edge of the level, and can't be separated. But the properties themselves are still objects. You can use that (WALL) and push in {IS} [FLOAT] to walk under the walls. (WATER) {IS} [SINK], (ROCK) {IS} [PUSH], but there's only one rock? Go ahead and push (ROCK) {IS} [PUSH] into the water to make a bridge; [SINK] takes any object after all. What if (DOOR) {IS} [SHUT] {AND} [OPEN]? What if (TEXT) {IS} [DEFEAT]? What if (BABA) {IS} (BABA)?While interactions with objects and their properties are near endless, the baseline mechanics of the game remain simple, and what the properties actually do remain static. Because of this, all the interactions you learn within the game come naturally, rather than feeling forced. This allows the game to stay approachable and intuitive, while still allowing a great amount of depth and complexity to the puzzles presented.If you're looking for a puzzle game that you can either binge in one day, or play an hour or so across a month, Baba Is You makes for a great pickup in both cases.Just make sure that, at all times, something, anything, {IS} [YOU].","Easily one of the best puzzle games I've played in a good while. What a great concept, what great puzzles.","Baba Is You has the same ingenious take on puzzles as 'Portal' did. Not necessarily in the physical sense, the gameplay is push and rewind-like but using words makes you feel like Dragonborn from Skyrim, you start thinking with...words? It's so interesting! Also the oddly melancholic soundtrack combined with beautiful artstyle makes this a very homely experience while you scratch your head at the impossible combinations of words required to beat every level.","Baba Is You is a deceptively simple game. The store page and plenty of other reviews do a good enough job explaining how it works, but what they leave out is how well the game takes advantage of the rules. There are games I've played with amazing concepts that were poorly executed, but Baba knows exactly what it's doing. While a fair number of the puzzles are pretty introductory, the difficulty steadily increases as you play the game and the puzzles at the end of each \"world\" force you to use what you've learned about the game rules earlier on to think outside the box.The best puzzle games make you think about things in ways you wouldn't before, and Baba does this in spades. I can't think of any other game that gives you the ability to rewrite the way the game works, and it would have been successful if it had just left it at that. The fact that Hempuli has made so many levels that knock it out of the park turns what would be a great game into an amazing one.","BABA is YOU and CUTEPretty cute game, I like the art. The gameplay is pretty inventive, you push blocks with words on them, and those words are the \" rules \" for that stageso most stages have BABA is YOU , so you're controlling the little white fluffy thingthen you have other things like ROCK is PUSH, so you can push rocksbut the fun comes in moving the words in unexpected ways, like ROCK is YOU , and now you control all the rocks on the screenOr maybe you change the win condition of FLAg is WIN to BABA is FLAG and on the same thing, goign down you can put BABA is WIN, so now the flag is baba, and you instantly win the level haha. another fun moment was WALL is YOU, and suddenly, i'm moving the entire wall structure in the level, drowning pieces of it as I get to the FLAg is WIN lolwith 200 levels, and a solid fun concept, you're going to get a lot out of this. It reminds me of games liek Scribblenauts, where there's an obvious way to solve the puzzles, and then ways you wouldn't think would work - half of the fun is in experimenting to see just what you can do .absolutely recommend this one, played for an hour - felt like I played for 10 minutes , a good sign that I enjoyed myself; as the saying goes \" time flies when you're having fun \"","You is walletWallet is cashcash is gamegame is you.Get the game if you like changing the rules!","Game is Brillo. Money Is Worth. Player Is Happy.Truly, this game is a puzzle masterpiece. The elements in the levels range from many to few and yet the easier levels are usually the ones with more stuff. I am about 30 levels in at the point of writing this and I have to say: all levels are brilliant, some are really hard, all of them are fair.Baba Is You is best at what makes a puzzle game great: figuring out a different way than intended by the developer.I cannot recommend it enough. I'd also like to add that this game is severely underpriced. It's a shame that indie devs are expected to sell at maximum 20 and people will still wait for sales.I encourage you not to wait for a sale. This guy deserves it.","A very cool game to try when you're not really in the mood for blasting, hopping or just mindlessly slugging it out with fantastical foes.  Visuals are crude but effective doing the job with the minimal amount of fuss.   Meshing words with concepts and bending it a bit to get the desired result is a great way to stave off mind decay for a bit each day.  Im not sure if this thing comes with an editor but that could surely be fun if it does.  Trying to see what you can cook up after you've finished the game would be a great deal more value for an already great game.  Try it without regret.","Baba is goodBaba is hardBaba is trickyBaba is worth itBaba is best","Great puzzle game.Manipulate logic to change rulesets of each puzzle.Starts simple, but gets complex quite quickly.Also, it's kind of funny and full of surprises (loved the poem)","Very relaxing and nice, I've been following the dev's work for a while and it's definitely worth the price! I'm very bad puzzle game though so I'll have to wait for hint pages or walkthroughs to help me out...","Baba Is You is an unique, accessible puzzle game. Though adhering to standard sokoban design, the puzzles (at least those I've played so far) require more lateral and creative thinking. There are many times when the game breaks with conventional game design making you question the social contract between you and the designer. (It's thematically meta in that way.) As a result, puzzles are not fiddly and intimidating but simple and fun.  Baba Is You is a game I'd recommend to someone who doesn't play puzzle games regularly and, hell, even someone who doesn't play games regularly; it's just that good.","Finally released! Never before have I played a puzzle game that was so simple to learn but so tough to master, and not because of traditional difficulty, it's rather quite logical. But you need to think outside the box. I believe the trailers should prove self explanatory but the tl;dr is this:You change the rules of the game as you play it, but sometimes changing the rules is difficult.Regardless, this game is brilliant, a timely release with no early access with a fair price and 10% goes to charity? I'll buy this game again any day, great work devs!","Very Solid and fun puzzle game","Baba Is Good","15$  IS  STEALSeriously, one of the best puzzle games I've ever played.  I rarely write reviews but I've been hyped for this game ever since playing the earlier demo that *deservedly* won a ton of awards when it first came out.  I would even say this game is priced too low for all the content it offers.  If you're even remotely on the fence, a level editor is in the works guaranteeing a ton of fan made levels when you finally do beat the game (and with a generous 200+ levels that should still take a fairly good amount of time to play through).Did I mention you need to buy this?  Yeah, you need to buy this.  10\/10, 5\/5 Stars, A++++, etc...   Thank you, Hempuli, for making such a great game.","Baba is You is a perfect fit for those who like when a game gives you a simple mechanic and build so many things on top of that. You will be surprised what this game has to offer. If you are into puzzle games it's a must have. Truly innovative experience.","Very inventive puzzler with unique \"rules\" mechanic that is super flexible. According to the devs even the primary mechanics are implemented using the in-game \"rules\" system.Chill soundtrack.Simple but aesthetically pleasing graphics.Highly recommend.","Baba Is Good","15$  IS  STEALSeriously, one of the best puzzle games I've ever played.

It's got unexpectedly solid level design, that makes good use of its neat gimmick! I don't even like block pushing puzzles, but I love Baba Is You.","MOOVRY IS REVIEW AND RECOMMENDBABA IS YOU  ISBUY","After playing for a few hours (after waiting for what felt like a few years), my initial impressions are pretty positive. Suitable challenge, plenty of options in how to approach puzzles, full of creative ideas and room for creative solutions.Easily recommend to anyone that likes playing puzzle games.","got stuck on several puzzles, have never been this enthralled with puzzle game, baba is me and love 10\/10 my brain is 9 times larger than when i started.","I'm calling it now, Baba is You is my GOTY 2019. I mean that earnestly, no other puzzle game has ever made me happier.If you aren't sure if this would be for you or not, this concept originated at Nordic Game Jam 2017 and that early concept version of the game is still available as a free download that you can treat as a demo for this retail release.","In the 30 minutes I've played already, I can already tell that this is one of the most innovative puzzle games in years. It's a mix between the 2D positioning based puzzles in games such as Steven's Sausage Roll, and the \"coding\" \/ word positioning puzzles found in Dan Mullins' Pony Island. Nothing is set in stone. YOU can be anything. You can win by anything. You can die by anything. You can be anything.... and anything can be you. Levels are so well crafted, many have multiple ways to complete them, if you're willing to go the extra mile to figure them out. I highly recommend this to any puzzle game fan.","Baba is hard","Baba Is You is a really interesting concept for a puzzle game! The base game itself is really nice, with an unusual concept based on rewriting the rules of the game as you play it. You might think that would get old eventually but there's a surprising amount that can be done with that idea and the game does a good job of exploring every aspect of it.A huge condition for me in terms of deciding whether or not I like a puzzle game is the difficulty and the ratio of fun to frustration. This game definitely has some puzzles that are frustrating at times, but it's balanced perfectly by having a lot of possible directions to go at once so even if you're stuck you can almost always try something else for a bit and come back. And some alternate paths will provide insight that will help solve previously difficult puzzles too. In all, this is my favorite puzzle game I've played in a long time!","It's a block pushing puzzle.It turns out that when the rules of the game are the blocks you can push, breaking them and mixing them into new sentences that change the rules of the game, the game becomes creative, mindbending, and satisfying in ways that a block pusher rarely is. The block pusher, one of the oldest computerized puzzle game genres, has been reinvented into something truly brilliant, decades after its inception. Absolutely not to be missed.Caution: It is easy to spend much more time than you meant to playing this game.","KEY is OPEN and PUSH, and DOOR is SHUT and STOP. Okay, I'll open the door with the key, consuming the key.Now BABA is YOU and OPEN, and WATER is SHUT. Okay, I'll open the water with myself...? Wait now I'm dead since I consumed myself.Now COG is OPEN and PUSH, and CRAB is SHUT. Okay, now I don't have to open the crab because it's only SHUT, not STOP.Now FLAG is OPEN and PUSH but there's no flags in the puzzle anyways. But if I write STAR is FLAG, now there are.","Such an imaginative setup.   I love pushing the words around and seeing what happens.  \"Water is Text\" and suddenly the screen is covered with text saying \"water\".  <grin>","Absolutely delightful puzzle game.  Every rule is simple on its surface and tricky in practice.  Difficulty curve is just about right to make you think for a minute then arrive at the answer.  There's very, very little hand-holding, every puzzle feels like a challenge even when they're obviously trying to teach you a new mechanic.  It teaches you by setting up the puzzles for an a-ha moment rather than telling you the solution to a simple puzzle.The \"extra\" stages, which are optional, can be absolute stumpers.  Feels awesome to solve them, but don't expect it to be easy.Lastly, the soundtrack is EXCELLENT.  Good, throbby, thinky basslines.  This is the best puzzle game I've played in years.  Up there with the trickier parts of Braid in how it makes you think about the tools at your disposal.Here's how much I dug this: I bought it twice!  These kind of levels are perfect for playing on the go on Switch, and there's several people I want to show it to.","To play this game is to alternate rapidly between smiling like an idiot and feeling like an idiot. It's wonderful.","I'm normally not one for puzzle games, because I'm dumb as a rock, but this game is just so charming.  I saw the demo in a GDQ event awhile ago, downloaded it off Itchio and been looking forward to it ever since.  $15 is a steal for this clever, adorable little puzzle game where you change the game rules by arranging words in order to win.  Have the flag (with Flag is Win) surrounded by walls but the walls have Walls is Stop?  Remove Stop and walk right past to the flag!  The puzzles have a nice variety, they add more words, such as \"And\" (So you can have Baba is You and Float)  to add to the challenge, and some of the special challenges remind me that I'm an idiot but I'm loving every minute of it. TL:DR:  Highly recommended if you like puzzle games, maybe even if you don't.","Good game","Been following Hempuli for a while on twitter and twitch, watching as he kept posting updates for this game, i tried to avoid watching the gameplay videos. I have to say that at  first it felt a bit like Adventures of Lolo for the NES. And then it just turned into something else. It's a very clever puzzle game and it's clearly made with love.","A rather unique puzzle game that includes the rules and the ability to change them as part of the puzzle solving. It twists your mind in all the right ways and has tons of levels to complete. It works like one of my other most favorite puzzle games, The Witness, where every puzzle has a simple concept, then it slowly starts opening more and more ideas to you until you're like.. well, what ISN'T possible?","Baba Is GreatIf Baba is you was just the first half of the game, it would be an amazing puzzle game with an amazing ideaBut the second half of the game \/ the lategame stuff elevates it to one of the best puzzle games of all time","A couple years ago I downloaded this strangely named title from itch.io on a whim.  Looked like a dopey little block-pushing game I could kill a few minutes with, and hey, it was free.What I found was one of the most brilliant puzzle games I'd ever come across.  Along with a promise that some day, at an unknown date in the future, there'd be a fuller, more fleshed out version. Today is that glorious day, and it's as great as I'd hoped.  Which means it was as great as the original, just so much more.  If you like puzzles, particularly ones that tax and reward your lateral (and literal!) thinking skills to their utmost, this is as good as you're going to find, and it's all presented in a very likable, relaxing way, which is good, because like all great puzzle games, occasionally you will want to pick your monitor up and bash it repeatedly on the closest hard surface.A masterpiece.  What are you doing?  Why aren't you playing it yet?","ROSES are REDVIOLETS are BLUEFLAG is WINBABA is YOU","I Am Baba","GA - IS - GOME ----- OD","Try the free version on Itch.io. If you like that, you'll love this. Great game!","thumb is up","baba is beautiful","Simple, elegant and fiendishly clever puzzler.","Baba is You is deceptively simple - you'll breeze through the early levels, get to grips with the mechanics, and then spend thirty minutes just staring at a single screen which, using those very same mechanics, will give you a headache and make you want to tear your hair out all at once. As soon as you think you've seen everything that the mechanics can do, you'll need to flip your thinking entirely on its head in order to figure out the next level. Finish a level? What if that same level had one minor change, a block here rather than there?Baba is Brilliant. Baba is Difficult. Baba is You.","Very interesting concept and a great game.","Not even an hour after opening and you'll see that it's hands down one of the most well designed puzzle games ever. The aesthetic is immediately striking with the goofy word choice, chirpy synths, and constantly moving images; it's absolutely adorable. The puzzles themselves are governed by rules that are very easy to understand, but become deceptively deep and nuanced as they get layered on top of each other. The presentation and puzzle design is top notch, they're incredibly challenging but never to a frustrating point. The non-linearity proves you'll never truly get stuck and it remains accessible for younger people, while difficult enough for more experienced players. I could go on all day, but it's truly an instant classic.","Brain IS Hurt.","What I find crazy about Baba Is You is that it could have been a console game in the 90s... in that a programmer could have created it with the technology of the time. Yet somehow, it's completely, utterly fresh. It looks like the past, and feels like the future.Instant classic. 10\/10.","An excellent puzzle game with an extremely creative concept. In Baba is You, the player solves puzzles by changing the very rules of the game using small movable nouns in the world. This involves altering the identity of the player character, changing the properties of objects in the world, or even giving yourself the WIN condition in order. $15 for this game is practically a steal.","At its most basic, it's a puzzle game about pushing things around.  Most importantly, however, those 'things' can include words.  And those words, when formed into statements, actually define the world around you.  So long as WALL IS STOP is aligned, then walls will stop you.  Move any piece of that, though, and it's no longer true.  Make WALL IS YOU and suddenly you are controlling every single wall on the map when you move.  ...That's the kind of game this is.  Simple but brilliant and guaranteed to make you have to relearn how to think - the exact way that a good puzzler works.tl;dr : BRAIN IS HURT"],["Baba is fun","VERY good game","that purgatory sound effect it makes when you diegood  game.","Review is GoodisRequired","If you like puzzle games, this game will be for you. The way you solve puzzles is so different from usual ones and honestly it is loads of fun. It can get frustrating when it takes awhile to figure out a puzzles, but so rewarding once you get it. It's def a game I recommend even when i'm pulling my hair out trying to solve one of the puzzles haha","Shoutouts to Simpleflipshttp:\/\/grandpasballs.com\/Great puzzle game that forces you to think outside the box.The graphics and music compliment each other to fit the minimalistic but engaging quality that the game aims to achieve.Baba is youBaba is lifeBaba is win","Baba is Great","THIS GAME IS WICKED HARDif you like a serious challenge you CANNOT miss out on this, it's really something specialthe soundtrack is so good you won't get sick of it when you're stuck for HOURS on one puzzle","I've been following the development of this ever since I saw it on itch.io and I'm happy it finally released. It's a lot of fun to try out different combinations of words and see what happens.Some levels were real headscratchers but it feels rewarding when you figure it out.I have not played it for super long yet so take that as you will, but so far I'm happy I got it. Perfect game for when you need something cozy. Also Baba is pretty cute.","BABA IS YOUBABA IS GOODREVIEW IS BABA IS YOUOkay but seriously this game is fun.  You can manipulate the rules of the world by combining words into different statements.So, if there is an obstacle you might be able to make WALL IS PUSH.   Then you can push the walls around.  Or maybe even WALL IS YOU.  Then you control the walls.It gets more involved in that, things like AND or multiple attributes you can make one thing.  Or turning objects into other objects!If you like puzzle games I would highly recommend BABA IS YOU.","baba you rock","Haven't even finished the game and I can recommend it. Really creative puzzles that can be quite challenging.10\/10 would Baba again.","Tremendously cute, unique as far as I know, decent pacing in level difficulty, AND THERE IS NO TUTORIAL! The game is just designed well enough that you don't need one!I'll update this as I play through with some metadata for you, prospective buyer!-No story, no cutscenes (so far), just puzzles and cuteness-No tutorial - this is a GOOD thing, there are only 6 hotkeys (7 if you count pause) and the mechanics are very consistent-It has a 'complete X of these Y puzzles to progress' instead of 'complete all puzzles linearly,' so no worries about getting stuck on one level unable to progress! (Note: You can, and probably receive some bonus reward for, completing all levels.)","I love when games make you feel smart and stuff, get it and feel like a genius today!","A wickedly difficult puzzle game that has you altering the rules of the world to reach the goal, often one you had to puzzle out what it even would be. Before the end of the first world one of my solutions was to create a paradox to vaporize the walls so I could make a starfish the goal point. You need a Galaxy Brain for this.","It's a wonderful puzzle game. Gets very tough fast.","Have a couple of hours on this game and all   i have to say is outstanding and great job.

It has been a long time, that a puzzle game has been so much relaxed fun. Some levels just catch you by surprise and you can't see the forest for the trees. You try absolutely ridiculous setups and after pulling your hair for ten minutes straight you finally see the light and complete the level in seconds. This game has nothing but charme. No cringey humour, no poor dialogue, just a refreshing and very creative take on block pushing puzzles.","Amazing","super hard game. i probably am not going to be able to beat it.despite that, i love it and recommend it, honestly.even if this game is so wack that i just don't get any of it about 3 or 4 areas past the tutorials i loved every second with iteven when i had no clue what i was doing, it was still so zen i didn't really get frustrated","All IS LoveLove IS BabaBaba IS You","BABA IS GOODME IS DUMBExcellent game. I honestly did not expect to enjoy this game so much. The concept is so basic yet executed so well. No puzzle feels like it's trying to just trick you or hoping you miss a simple bit of information like many other puzzle games do, everything follows basic logic and you'll feel stupid sometimes for not having figured it out earlier.The solution to many puzzles might seem simple when watching someone solve it but the true challenge comes from understanding how to manipulate the rules of the level by pushing around simple words.It's like someone told you to change how a script in a game works by just rearranging existing functions.Behind the exterior of this simple looking game there is a fantastic experience that will surely get that brain working.I've barely only scratched the surface of what this game has to offer and I'm both excited and scared to jump back in to see more.","Absolutely do not buy the game if you aren't ready to think outside the box because in this game, you have to think both in and out of the box and if that doesn't work, become the box itself. The game is also relatively long. As of writing this I am 5 hours in and by the looks of it, only 20% of the way through (and puzzles tend to get harder as the game goes on).I'd recommend it, especially as something you can distract yourself with alongside a podcast or whatever (like I tend to do).","The game is amazing.

Great game and really enjoyable puzzles!","Well done!","Just found the first \"meta\" puzzle in the game and immediately decided to write a review. This is undoubtedly one of the best, if not THE best puzzle game I have ever had a pleasure of playing. And haven't even finished it yet!I was really excited for this game after playing the Nordic Game Jam version, but the finished result exceeds my wildest exspectations.Just about everything in it is absolutely delightful, but the very gist, the mechanics and the puzzles built upon them - are of a quality and variety I've never seen before. It's all very nicely knit together, while not becoming stale or frustratingly hard - at least, that's how I feel after playing for almost 13 hours.(BABA) {IS} (BEST)(also, please do check Stephen's Sausage Roll if you liked this game, it really deserves more love)","Baba is PuzzleBaba is GoodGood is Win","As i figured out the trick to a puzzle i muttered to myself \"that's right Baba is Baba \"Best and most mind bending puzzle game since Portal 2","Baba is win","This is one of the best puzzle games I've played. There's a surprisingly large amount of content here - starting from simple(ish) puzzles to get you used to the core mechanics, passing through harder puzzles that test your understanding of those mechanics, and winding up taking the concept places you'd never expect. The game is continuously inventive and hilarious throughout all this.  Well worth 11 of anyone's money.","Good ass game","game logic is Easybutpuzzle is  varied.Bought 6 portions for my 6 sonsHope them enjoy it. XD","this is easily the best puzzle game ive played in the past few years. you might think that a game that relies in a single gimmick would get repetitive quickly, but baba is you manages to make every puzzle and solution unique. of the levels ive completed (128 as of this review), virtually none have been solved in ways similar to others, and even the \"extra\" versions of some levels require very different solutions and approaches to solving.the main gimmick itself is very fun to mess around with and figure out as well; messing with the rules of the game is incredibly satisfying and there are countless ways that you can arrange the blocks of instructions to create different rules (and even those rules interact with each other in different ways). not only that, but the rules of every level are different and the situations presented always require some experimentation with a level's available objects.the puzzles themselves are all deeply complex; as i said before, no two levels ive played have been solved in similar ways. the game makes use of new and old mechanics at the same time comprehensively, making each puzzle unique. each level requires you to actually pay attention, and nothing about the puzzles get old or repeat in subsequent puzzles.i genuinely cannot come up with any flaws that this game has. i never thought that a puzzle game that relied on one mechanic could be as deep, difficult, and outright fun to play as baba is you, but this game took that assumption and kicked it in the  nuts.would recommend to everyone, whether experienced with puzzle games or not.","..........BabaGame IS Good...........You","Polished, indie, innovative puzzle game. I love it.","This is a very different game from Hempuli's previous game, Environmental Station Alpha. However, it shares that game's unorthodox but interesting approach to game design. The premise is off-putting at first, but it quickly turns out to be loads of fun and tough to master. The soundtrack is a huge improvement over that from ESA, and in my opinion is worth the price of the game just by itself. My only gripes are that there's no story (though what story could justify what goes on?) and no hints.","The best puzzle game since Portal.","I don't think I've ever been sold on something quicker than the first 15 seconds of the trailer. The game's delivered on that, though many puzzles have a lot of moving blocks around once you figure out the solution. Later on there are times when you feel like you've hit a brick wall, or have to think too much - the game is best when you're learning and experimenting with new mechanics. This can make finishing areas a bit of a drag, but the game is constantly introducing new ideas for it's entire run time. While $15 may seem high for the graphics and grid based mechanics, it's entirely worth it for the number of levels and ideas on display. I would recommend it if the trailer makes you at all interested.","I have never played a puzzle game as engrossing as Baba is You. Each and every puzzle is a labor of love, and you can absolutely feel that while playing. The logic mechanics are astounding, reliable, and frustratingly easy to understand- and yet, I've never had a game challenge me as much as Baba does! You've got to do some very outside-of-the-box thinking to get through some of the puzzles. It's fantastic, and is already one of my favorite games. Wholeheartedly recommend.","Is good!","\"Baba Is You\" is a push-puzzle game based on rules. By pushing, you can change and break these rules. And each level is designed around doing just that. A simple concept that is the complex core of an amazing puzzle game that will change the way you think about solving puzzles.Hopefully, we'll get an editor so LEVEL is MORE.But for the many levels and puzzles that are given, YOU is THINK.Playing this game in small chunks and working with the rules, and discovering possible solutions for others in the process?TIME is MOVE.But what do I think about this game?\"BABA is YOU\" is WIN.","BABA IS YOUREVIEW IS SPOILER","Inventive, challenging, and addictive. If you love brain-burning puzzle games, this is for you! The aesthetic and sound are nice as well.","best puzzle game i've played since spacechem","Anyone who likes Stephen's Sausage Roll should try this game and vice versa.","Out of all the games I've ever played, Baba Is You is easily among the best of the best. From concept to execution it's nothing short of a stroke of genius. Easy to understand yet extremely difficult to fully explain.The main idea is simple: It's a tile-based puzzle game where the specific rules of each level are determined by simple phrases, usually exactly 3 words in length much like the game's title. The words that make up these phrases are visible tiles within the level itself, and you can push said words around to rearrange them and alter the rules of the level as you see fit in order to complete it. The sheer magnitude of intrigue this simple concept produces is frankly completely nuts.Apart from the fantastic, challenging gameplay I just find the general aesthetic of the game to be incredibly pleasing. Graphically it has a certain balance of three familiar and minimal art styles which come to mind: \"chalkboard doodle\", \"ASCII graphics\", and \"ZX Spectrum graphics\" which give the game a certain coziness and readability. The game's music tends to be very atmospheric and relaxing on top of that, my personal favorites being Tree is Shift and Rocket is DustWhen all is said and done, the only thing this game really needs is a proper level creation tool, and thankfully the dev plans on adding one after a few tweaks and fixes are out of the way.","The game is fun. If it's not fun, why bother. This one is hella fun.","Very interesting puzzle, dazzling style complements it really well. Flawless Linux support is a cherry on top!","This is the best puzzle game to be released since The Witness. This game has the most ingenious uses of a core mechanic I've seen in a long time. The game never manages to feel repetitive either; every single level so far has surprised me in new ways. You will also be very hard-pressed to breeze through this game; the puzzles spike in difficulty very fast and stay consistently hard throughout the game. That said, most are never tear-your-hair-out difficult, and for the few that are, the non-linearity of the game allows you to skip any troublesome levels and come back later. This is the game everyone will be talking about in 2019. Play it now.","It is exceedingly rare that I see a game that I'd recommend to virtually any game player.  Rarer still is when that game is a puzzle game.  This is such a game, which places it aside the Portal games and....not much else, frankly.The mechanics of the game are akin to sokoban.  You move your avatar around and push blocks until you achieve the win condition for each given map.  But it plays very differently, because the rules that define how the game functions are represented as sequences of blocks on the map.  And if you can reach those elements, you can push them around and change the rules of the map.  For instance, you might see the rule that \"WALL IS STOP\".  This means, as you might expect, that wall tiles will stop your character's movement...you cannot move through them.  But...if you simply push the \"STOP\" tile away from \"WALL IS\"...walls will no longer stop your movement.  The resulting game ends up being an endless procession of clever and absurd puzzles where the entire of the puzzle changes as you alter rules left and right.  This DOESN'T, however, mean that the puzzles do not retain their challenge.   While  the initial puzzles are pretty easy, they soon become challenging enough to require some real thought.There are over two hundred puzzles in the game, and at the rate at which the difficulty increases I'd expect the endgame puzzles to be fairly brutal.  About the only gripe I can make with  this game is that it will end...an editor would be very nice (although I'm not entirely sure that there won't eventually be one, as the discussion boards hint that such a thing might be an outside possibility).  If you thoroughly DETEST puzzle games, you might want to stay away but otherwise I'd easily recommend this at its full price tag.","If you liked the itch.io demo version, you'll love this. It's basically just more of the same kind of stuff, with all new ideas added into the mix. Excellent game.","BABA IS FUNTIME IS GONE","im playing way too much of this game im not even good at it the only puzzle game i've ever loved this much was portal","Great game, clever design, don't sleep on it.","BABA IS PAINHASGAMEANDYOU","Not certain this game adheres strictly to constructs of modern EnglishBut it is simply syllogistically beautiful","BABA is AMAZINGI was pretty hyped for Baba is You after playing the prototype (which you can still play for free if you need a small taste), but the full version managed to completely supersede these expectations. Baba is You surprises, makes you think and makes you feel clever (when you manage to solve the puzzle) consistently throughout the games. The cutesy simple artstyle manages to get the point through, and is perfect for this kind of game.You may think that the concept would get boring, but every world introduces new concepts\/words and builds upon previous concepts, and every puzzle stays fresh. Some puzzles do feel a bit more like geometrical puzzles then logic puzzles, but there's so many puzzles that they don't feel dominant. Whatever you prefer, with the length of this game, you'll be sure to get your money's worth (200+ levels!).The biggest downside I can think of is that there aren't as many easier levels, so if you have trouble getting through puzzle games, the difficulty may be a bit too much of a spike. But at this pricepoint, the first few worlds alone are probably worth it. Also, the game is rather forgiving with the amount of levels you need to beat to complete a world, so you can always skip a few levels and go back to worlds later (I think I've unlocked most worlds, but I've only completed a few so far).It is probably one of the best puzzle games ever created, possibly the best. If you like puzzle games, you would be making a mistake in not trying it.","Such a simple concept executed to perfection.  Easily the best puzzle game of the past few years, possibly the best game period over that same time frame.Imagine a Zachtronics game that doesn't hate you combined with the charm and character of Undertale.","I bought this game after watching Northernlion fail miserably to solve even the initial levels.

Brain-meltingly good. I may not be able to 100% it but I damn will try.","Baba IS you AND fun.","Baba is great! I don't typically play puzzle games, but Baba had me hooked the moment I saw it on Youtube. Baba applies simple controls with movable puzzle blocks that change the \"rules\" of the game. The rules can change everything from what you touch to win, if objects can be pushed, even to who You are! If you enjoy puzzles that scale in difficulty as your knowledge of the game does, Baba is perfect.","BA   I   SM BA  S  ART ===   BA   I   GR===   BA  S  EATI've been waiting a year for this game and it's everything I'd hoped. There are definitely some puzzles where I'm smashing my head on my desk, but like all great puzzles, discovering the solution is a rush that can't be matched by any action game. I'm barely through the first half and I can wholeheartedly recommend it!There are a few \"echo\" puzzles, but really they are there to teach you solutions that are less obvious. BABA really expects you to get out of the box *very* early in the game. By the second world you have to use the [IS] block to transform [YOU] into different things. Each new mechanic is gently introduced, then you're thrown right into the mind-vice. A little program knowledge will help, but BABA is really about playful exploration. The backspace key is your friend! Take your time and find multiple solutions, try crazy things; you'll be surprised by what works and amazed with how you can use it. This is a truly unique game. Don't miss out. So, when's that workshop support coming, eh? :)","Crazy puzzly fun for a code-oriented mind.

That being said, not only is this game awesome it's absolutely ORIGINAL which in this day and age is extremely rare. As a sheep (i.e. \"Ba Ba\", get it?) it's your job to win each level by grabbing the flag. -Or is it? By pushing different sets of words around you alter the rules of the game in some very interesting and unique ways. Pushing the \"Flag\" block into the \"Baba\" block can change the sentence to \"Flag Is You\" and *poof* suddenly you're the flag moving around. That's but one very small example. Things get much more complicated as you go along, levels even start adding \"And\" into the mix to form complex rules. The logic, it's just amazing.Sure, you're always going to have a game that comes along that's \"the next Zelda\" or \"a bigger Mario\" but Baba is You is its own thing entirely. As a game dev myself I find it inspiring. P.S: Kudos for having a puzzle game that's genuinely difficult but in the best sort of way, never dumbing itself down to its audience and instead inviting the player to rise to each challenge.","BABA ISfresh, refreshing, simple, beautiful, surprising, different, well thought, out of the box, mind blowing, awesome game design and variety.I showed this game to all my friends...

The core gameplay conceit is really appealing--I was a huge fan of Hack 'N' Slash by Doublefine--but these puzzles feel tedious and unintuitive.Maybe I don't like it very well because I despise Sokoban. Although it's unfair to say that this game is \"just\" indie Sokoban, it's undeniable that the logic of Sokoban or other tile sliding puzzles is prominently featured. As a silly example, all the \"fixed\" 3-block rules for a level are parallel and adjacent to walls, preventing them from being broken up. You'll constantly need to reason about ordering your moves in a way that feels unfortunately close to just playing Sokoban directly for me.I also feel like the puzzles are very unintuitive and I personally never got the feeling of satisfaction that some people report. Trying to understand the behavior of different properties interacting with each other didn't fill me with joy so much as a frustration that I needed to smash everything together in every combination to get a real sense of what the game designer intended. It's entirely possible my soul is immune to the joy of discovery, but I really hated this part of the game.Altogether it's very well-designed, with a lovely aesthetic and nice convenience features like infinite (and fast!) undo.

Before I bought this game, I expected 5 hours of puzzles, then when i started, 10-15 hours, and now, I think i'll take maybe 40+ hours to beat the game (fully that is). This does very very VERY novel things, and very often uses novel and new ways to solve puzzles instead of repeating concepts.Towards where I am now, levels that aren't introductory now take an avg of 20-30+ mins, and are each generally rewarded with a satisfying OOHHHhbabaisgood.","As of 100%ing my way through to world three (there are extra levels in each world you can skip), I think this sets a standard for how puzzle games should be made.I can't think of any cons, and here are my pros.I have a problem when games have rules they don't teach me, and I spend 30 minutes guess-and-checking until I stumble on what I'm supposed to do.>>I have so far always felt I had the tools to solve every puzzle, even if I have trouble piecing them togetherI love when a game's core mechanics are something I've never seen before.>>I haven't played anything like this, and I've played a hundred-something different flash puzzle games.I love when a game focuses on what makes it fun, and doesn't try to force too many ideas.>>This game focuses on what's fun about it.>>It has enough charm to have an identity, but not so much that it becomes distracted with trying to bring a world to life in place of the puzzlesNow I haven't beaten it but I'll addI dislike games that don't escalate in cleverness, but instead lengthen the sequence of actions you have to take to the point that you just can't keep track of everything.>>I'm only on world three, but so far, even the extra challenge levels have been solvable with a reasonable number of steps.","Deceptively simple on the surface, incredibly difficult once you venture in.

Kind of a Zachtronics-lite?","If you watched the trailer and thought \"Oh, that's a cool concept, I think this game is for me\" I have good news: This game is for you! Not only does the game explore what obvious things it can do with this sort of rules manipulation, it also explores plenty of non-obvious (and fun) ones. I'm only ~7 hours in so far and I look to have plenty of worlds and levels left to explore.The game also gets difficult quite quickly. After breezing through the few levels I was worried that if since I got the base idea, I wouldn't get challenged by the first few worlds. That wasn't an issue. Plenty of levels are difficult enough to get you stuck, but since you always unlock multiple levels ahead you are not *really* stuck without a way to progress. So A+ for the difficulty curve, something that indie puzzle games often can get wrong.I've been playing with a friend over voice chat by sharing my screen. Even though the game is single player, since most of the gameplay is *thinking* about what to do, it works well to play with friends next to you or by screen sharing. And if my friend sees something to try out on a level they can just tell me how to move.The graphics are what you see in the trailer, that is, not impressive at all. At times I wish there at least was an option to \"turn on anti-aliasing\", but yeah, you're not buying this game for its stunning graphics anyways. The soundtrack and sound effects are nice enough. I'm yet to get bored with the music, but if do I can just to turn it off and listen to some other music while playing since, (at least from the levels I've seen so far), the sounds aren't relevant to solving the levels.The only thing I really hope the developer adds in the future is support for a level editor letting us upload custom maps and level packs to the workshop.","Best puzzle game I've played in a long time","KEKE > BABAChange my mind.","One of the most creative puzzle games I've seen in a while.

If you are bored and like puzzles, I can definitely say that this game is for you.","I've been playing this for about three floors and it's wonderful so far. It's a refreshing puzzle game, for me at least, that sometimes really requires you to think about the solution. And yet, the concepts are pretty simple. 10\/10.","BA IS BE AND GO\nBA    ST     TY","Baba is You is a game where rules are not just meant to be broken, but tampered, scrambled, and reconfigured. In it, you control a... white thing (except when you don't) and push rocks (except when you can't) around to reach the winning flag (except when it's something else).See, the rules of the game are also physical entities within the game. Turn something you push into the winning object, make solid walls into background noise, and even change what you're controlling, with the proper adjustments. Solving a level is not just how to move things around to reach the goal, but also how to change the rules to overcome obstacles.The rules themselves come with intuitive syntax: Colored words refer to objects, grey words are operative, and black words on colored tiles are properties. The game does a good job easing you into the logic of the world and teaching you how the rules work, then it grabs you by the ankles and chucks you into the deep end as each sub-area provides more twists and words to use and abuse in your quest to take the game apart by the seams.Progress is measured in little dandelion seeds and blooming flowers. Each completed level rewards you a seed, and each sub-area has a seed quota that will reward you with a flower. These flowers in turn, if you collect enough of them, will unlock gates on the map that lead to more levels and areas.The game also doesn't ask much for you to complete it. The maps are structured so that if you're having troubled with a level, there's likely other levels available for you to complete instead. Completed levels reveal all adjacent levels and sometimes tracks to another set of levels, so your options expand faster than you can usually exhaust them if you're getting stumped. In fact, though 10 sub-areas are available on the world map, you only need three flowers to access Level Finale and see the credits.You, however, are probably not going to pay $15 (or whatever this game is in local pricing) to beat roughly 25 levels in this game with more than 200 of them. Playing past the finale, you'll find that Baba is You still holds many levels and secrets, in keeping with the theme that the only thing that dictates the game are the rules, and those can change. Spoiling them will ruin the surprise, but some of the shenanigans it pulls are so clever I have to share them with someone. For now, I'll leave you with a cryptic observation.Say... why does the world map also have rules?","Baba Is YouGame Is WinBrain is MeltRecommend Is Yes","nice puzzles","\"Baba is you\" is a unique 2.1d puzzle game that is truly addictive. I played a lot of puzzle game but I would say the puzzle in this game are the most humorous and well designed of all. Compare to the trivial puzzle in The Witness, this won't make me dizzy; compare to Stephen's Sausage Roll, this has much more interesting mechanics. It is hard to see such a puzzle masterpiece nowadays.","I saw someone stream the gamejam build of this game and was instantly hooked on \"Baba is you\", As a programming student the logic to me is basically visualized programming logic with various if statements. Most levels can be solved several ways because there the win condition is based on internally changeable logic rather than a preset pattern. For 12 euro for 200 levels is an absolute steal.","Best Sokoban style game I've played. Rules are dynamically made from the text blocks. Great puzzles and tons of aha-moments. I love this.

I'm not a big fan of puzzle games as many of them become too complex and tedious after few levels. This one has managed so far to be challenging without being tedious.Why is that? Well in other puzzle games, as you advance they often present larger levels with more and more pieces to manipulate, past a certain point I end up moving them randomly until I get lucky or give up.On the other hand, this clever game has a manageable number of pieces to move around in a level, and you think hard until you find the trick that solves the puzzle, which is very satisfying.","Makes me feel like an idiot. 10\/10","This game is really great.

I've been looking forward to its release for a while and am so glad with what I got. Also it is one of those games that lend itself very well to workshop, looking forward to the levels that ppl will create!","Baba is ExcellentBaba is You is a rule-based puzzle game developed by Hempuli Oy. Ive had this on my radar for a little while, and despite not being particularly good at puzzle games I knew this would be a day one purchase for me. The easiest way to understand how the game works is to watch the trailer, Im just here to tell you how bloody fantastic this game is (even if youre not particularly good at puzzles).Positives: The art and animations are quite simple, but I think they look great and suit the game. The colours are well selected Id say.The way puzzles work here is just fantastic. Baba is You works around rules. Each level has different rules, some can be changed, and some cant. The puzzles in this game are all about manipulating the rules youre presented with in order to meet the win condition (which in some cases you can change). The reason I like it all so much, is because the solution is always sitting in front of you. There are no hidden rules, and the game is quite good at teaching you new mechanics, you just have to figure out what to put where in order to win. Having everything on the screen in front of you also makes it a little less daunting for players who aren't as good at puzzle games, that's certainly the way I've felt with it.Baba is You makes you feel so incredibly smart when you finally finish a level. Even with the tutorial section at the beginning, I felt really good about solving the puzzles. I quite quickly reached a point where I was having a hard time with each level, but the satisfaction of beating a level is just great. I desperately want to beat this game, and its not often that I feel that way.Obviously Im nowhere near beating the game yet, but the level variety has been excellent so far. Not only that, but all of the levels have been consistently excellent. There is a lot of content here, according to the store page theres 200 levels and after three hours Im only 20 levels in. Im sure the time taken to beat each level continues to increase as you progress through the game as well. This really is one of those games that sticks with you. When I was playing this with my girlfriend last night, we got stuck on a particular level, and Ive been thinking about it since, trying to figure out a way I could make it work and beat the level. Again, there arent many games that stick with me that much.Baba doesnt have any kind of co-op mode or anything, but its great fun to play with a partner. As I mentioned, Ive played some of it with my girlfriend and it was really fun to try and figure out the levels together. And because Baba has quite a simple, rule-based premise, its really easy for other people to pick up. In fact, my girlfriend was immediately better at solving the puzzles than I was.As well as giving you the ability to reset you can undo moves too! This is super helpful, especially for the longer levels. It's really easy to push a word into a place where you can't move it, having undo has saved me a lot of restarts.10% of the money that the dev earns from the game goes to charity, givingwhatwecan.org to be precise. Not often you see something like that outside of HumbleBundle, I think its great that the dev is donating some of his earnings from this. Negatives:This is purely because Im bad at puzzle games, but I feel like having some kind of hint system would have been a good inclusion. Perhaps triggered by spending a certain amount of time on one level. I dont want to have to look up the solutions to levels, but occasionally I would have liked a hint. This is really minor, but the cursor doesn't disappear despite not being used whether you're playing KB or gamepad. I just find that annoying.Verdict:Baba is You is absolutely fantastic, and most definitely one of the best puzzle games Ive played. I love the rule-based puzzles and its one of those games that I cant stop thinking about. If you have ever enjoyed a puzzle game, then this is an absolute must have, even at full price. This is certainly an early consideration for my personal game of the year title. JUST BUY IT!If you found this review helpful, please consider following my curator page: Kemo's Corner.","BA\n      IS    WIN\nBA","I turned the walls into me and myself into a crab.

Whatever Baba is, they're Me and I accept this fate.","I'll update more later, but from what I've seen, this game is amazing","BABA IS YOU AND SHINY","This game challenges you to think outside the box.. then then cube... then the hypercube.  What seems like a simple gimmick at first leads to some mind-blowing puzzles, and some very surprising behavior from the game.The whole idea of the game is that the level's rules are made up of pushable pieces of text, allowing you to re-write the rules of the game and transform the entire level by declaring that all the walls are now keys, and all the grass is now lava.  The levels are often structured to limit you in ways that will force you to solve at least part of the puzzle a certain way, still forcing you to think rather than find one win-all solution.. however, you can imagine that times when you are allowed a lot of freedom with the rules, surprising and strange solutions will reveal themselves to clever players.Some of the challenge stages are really quite diabolically hard, but you will feel SO good when you solve them, and finally get that achievement for clearing an entire area.  Most of the regular stages are quite do-able once you get a handle on what kinds of things do and do not work.May add more to the later if I think of it.  For now, just know that this is a very worthwhile game.  Probably will be best indie puzzler of the year in my book.  Highly recommended.","Baba is FunBaba is GoodUser is BuyI am not one to usually pick up puzzle games, however when I saw the trailer for baba it caught my eye because of it's simplistic and cute style. It's no doubtedly a game that had me pulling out my hair trying to figure out what to do, even in the early levels, but the amount of \"aha\" moments I had in this game already gave me it's moneys worth, and it's something I definitely plan on seeing to the end.","BABA IS LIFEISLOVE","\"Baba Is You\" is a tile pushing puzzle game with a twist: Words like object names, adjectives, and conjunctive verbs are also tiles and can be placed next to each other to form sentences. These sentences, like \"Rock is push\" change the behavior of all rocks on the screen and allow the player to push the rocks around until the sentence is broken. All objects (except words) must have rules to have any meaning. The modifier \"You\" must be in a sentence for you to be able to move anything. And you can move anything. If you push together the sentence \"Baba and Wall is you\" then every wall in the stage will match your characters movements. If it isn't clicking yet, don't worry. It will. And when it does, you get to puzzle in ways you never would have though possible. You're playing with the games logic while playing the game and using that power to solve puzzles. It's creative, it's challenging, and it's brilliant.I cannot stress enough how much every person needs to play this game. It's not a masterpiece by any means, but it's simple and addictive enough that it will probably be cited in years to come as a prime example of good game design.9\/10. Highly recommended.","I great puzzle game that will challenge your brain.","Amazing game, would buy again","One of the most important things for me in puzzle games is pacing.

Been playing side by side with a friend, and we both solve each stage differently. It's really challenging, but very rewarding.  The visuals are cute and goofy, which is fitting for when you turn into a wall. The music is just the right style of beeps and boops that doesn't get too repetitive.10\/10, I am a crab now.","What a smart game!

It's very hard to unintentionally break this game, everything about the rule system stays internally consistent at all times.Best if you don't spoil it for yourself.","Baba is you is a brutal puzzle game the likes of which I have not seen in a long, long time. The last puzzle game I remember that achieved this level of mind-boggling greatness was Denki Blocks for the GBA. And that was in 2001, excluding ports.By \"brutal\" I mean extremely challenging and extremely well designed.Many solutions are *very* obtuse, but aren't devoid of logic. Often, you'll find out that the extremely obtuse puzzles give you a sort of tool or method to use later on once you understand how it worked. You have to experiment and figure out how the mechanics work.If you're the type who likes to analyze things and think extremely hard, this is the best puzzle game I've played in who knows how long.

Later, the game asks you to master those concepts in order to progress through all of the \"bonus\" content.Pros:+ Great puzzle design, that shows and doesn't tell+ Good soundtrack that keeps you focused without getting in the way+ Fun graphics that fit the theme+ Fast undo\/restart keeps you in the puzzle, instead of fighting the game+ Lots of levels (more than you think!)Cons:- Occasionally it is difficult to fully understand precisely how mechanics work. A sandbox mode would be good to play around with the game rules in an unconstrained environment.- Difficulty of puzzles can be a bit all over the place (hard puzzles followed by very easy ones).- Occasional crashes in edge cases (a stack of 10,000 flags causes out-of-memory errors)- No level editor (coming soon?)","GAME is CUTE and INNOVATIVEmakesACHEonBRAINIf you think you're smart, and want to feel dumb when you run into truly impossible puzzles, and also like messing with blocks, and rules, and cute bunnies, and transforming the entire world into yourself...

I has Game, Baba is fun and Let's Go.by another victim of the Northernlion Effect","Baba is You is an absolute delight, standing out for its creative mechanics and constantly fresh level design.I would describe it as the best example of a blocksworld puzzle game that I've experienced. If you like the genre you'll love it. If you've not tried the genre this is the best possible game to try it with. If you don't like the genre...well it probably won't convert you. It is what it is and not every game suits every player.The basic gameplay is to walk around a 2D area pushing blocks into the right formation to win the level. The twist is that some of the blocks contain rules indicating how the blocks behave - which ones can be pushed, destroy each other, move by themselves, are the objective that makes you win the level, and so on.The titular \"Baba is you\" refers to a common arrangement of three blocks that makes the sheep you. That means your controls move the sheep. If there's more than one sheep then they move all of them at once. If you somehow disassemble \"Baba is you\" then your controls do nothing - unless you've made something else be you by pushing some other rule blocks around.Every few levels the game introduces new blocks and most of them significant change game play. A little shy of 20 levels in I'm still seeing new blocks and they're not slight transformations on old blocks but things that make new types of puzzle and solution possible. Stuff like \"and\" and \"not\" allowing conditional phrases, \"empty\" allowing you to perform some operation on every space containing nothing, \"word\" causing a block to simultaneously count as what it is and a rule block describing what it is, with the properties of both - the new additions feel creative rather than derivative and most levels will stretch you rather than being a trivial expansion on what you already knew.If you like logic puzzles, lateral thinking or blocksworld games pick it up immediately. If you want to try something new then it's different to most other games out there at the moment. If you're interested in game design then it's worth the price of admission to see an innovative take on an old mechanic.The creator also pledges 10% of their personal income to charity via efficient altruism, that's not a reason to grab a game on its own, but it's an extra thing to feel good about in getting it.","Most realistic gameLosing definition of You = game over","Game IS Good","it's got the puzzles the way i like em","GAME is HARD and FUN.","Broke my brain.

The game starts out really simple to let the player get the hang of the rules and slowly ramps up the difficulty of the puzzles as the player progresses.

It just felt so refreshing to sit there, thinking about how I could go about things, over complicating the process only to find out that the solution was actually really simple. There is so much elegance in the simplicity of the game.Even if you are able to speed through the puzzles blazingly fast I think the execution of the idea makes the experience well worth it.

But only two of them were special enough for me.One is Opus Magnum. The amount of satisfaction you get from it and the sheer willpower you need to have to not spam your friends with the gifs of your creations made it one of my favorite puzzles ever made.The other is... well... it's Baba.Baba is amazing. It's cute. It's fun. It either makes you feel incredibly smart or incredibly stupid, but it's always incredible. There is often more than one solution for a problem, which is awesome, because different people may think differently and find their own approaches. The whole idea to change the rules of the world is just brilliant. It makes you think outside the box.I especially love the levels that have the same layout but different rules (although don't worry, the level variety is pretty big, the repetition is rare and very intentional). It breaks your mind, but in the right and very satisfying way.Baba makes you think about what elements you should use, what elements you can't use at all and what elemets are there to distract you. It's very simple at it's core, but not easy. It's mechanics are intuitive, but it keeps adding new ones as you play to keep things fresh.I wish I had more to say about this game. I honestly can't find a single flaw with it. I like it visually, I like the music, I like the gameplay. But there's nothing I can add that will make you buy this game. You either love what you see already, in the screenshots and videos on both Steam and Youtube, or you don't and it's also fine. You just need to find your own puzzle game, something that will click with you personally, like Baba did with me. But if you like what you see and still hesitate - don't. It's exactly what it looks like and you will love every second of it.BABA IS WIN","The game is intriguingly hard as Stephen's Sausage Roll, and well-designed as the Witness.This will be one of my favorite puzzle games I have ever played!However, I don't want to recommend it to non-puzzlers,not just because it is too hard but also because several puzzles (even regular ones) require dealing for subtle situations.To solve puzzles you sometimes have to think what would happen if \"flag is win\" as well as \"flag is defeat\",or if \"rock is flag\" as well as \"rock is wall\".I actally loved this aspect of the game, but it might annoy the people who don't like 'finding rules'.","Baba is you,Stupid is me","You need to think like the game has logic, but the logic from a 9 year old when he writes a story as a homework.The hole game makes sense.

With a charming art style reminiscent of a child's drawing book and chill music that reminds you to take your time, this game is an absolute joy to sit down and unwind with, cannot recommend it enough to just about anyone of any age or experience with games.","Fun and creative puzzle game.The puzzles are grouped in zones with levels gradually becoming harder. The first couple of levels are relatively easy but serve as a way to showcase new concepts specific to that zone, which you will need in later levels.You are free to choose the order in which you want to clear the zones and its levels, so if you get stuck you can move on to a different one and come back to it later.","Great game!

A game which manages to build confusing and challenging puzzles with a very basic set of rules. Very intentionally designed, there aren't many puzzles that you can beat using an unintended solution. There is something amusing and sinister about a game that displays the rules at all times like they're hints but still you struggle with them. It's a wildly creative game for how limited this genre tends to be.It does have some flaws however. It throws you into the deep end very early on and there are some very important interactions that aren't obvious and the game expects you to figure out instead of teaching you. very few puzzles suffer from this luckily, and depending on your temper this could be a good thing. These interactions scale however, you can skip certain levels and figure out a trick on another that is relevant. The music also contains honks of a somewhat threatening aura. This does not bother me but I know someone who was disturbed by this.It's fun, get it.","GA     MEISGOOD","One of, if not \"the\", best puzzle games out there","Perfect game. Purchased right away and got exactly what I've expected after watching a trailer.Strongly recommend for the people who into such puzzle games.","I think the best puzzle games are the ones where the final solution is simple and elegant. I often find myself marvelling after solving a puzzle in Baba is YOu, that it took me so long to see something that was in the end fairly straightforward. The design in minimal and elegant in its minimaalism.,","The Good- Simple yet sweet and cartoonish graphics that are quite nice to look at. The level design is also very good.- A big number of levels, which can become incredibly challenging. The solution of many of them can be very creative.- A pretty nice OST that reminds me of old school games, quite cheap as well.The Neutral- If you're doing this game without hints, prepare to twist your brains: some of them require to think WAY out of the box and know specific mechanics.- This game could use some mod compatibility for new levels and maybe new words, just a suggestion though.The Bad- Can't really think of anything.Veredict: A solid A+. A must-have for puzzle lovers!","BABA IS HOTBRAIN IS MELT","Don't be fooled by its cutesy facade, the game is hard! I thought this would be another one of those gimmicky games with novel mechanics but boy oh boy was I wrong about this one. Despite the novel mechanics (lol), the puzzles in this game are surprisingly solid and I'm really really impressed by the amount of thought that has been put into the making of each level.The first few levels will lead you into a false sense of security and then the difficulty curve just go straight up and you'll really have to scratch your head quite a bit to find solutions - and this is all before more and more words are gradually added to the mix, making it even HARDER, but this is not me complaining, this is what a proper puzzle game looks like.Buy it and try it for yourself, the novelty and the thoughts and love put into the game by the developers really make it shine, it's pretty good.","Essentially teaches you the mechanics and then throws you into the deep end. In practice it's a little more gradated than that, because each world introduces a new word or two and gives you a couple of easier levels before getting into the meat of it, but beyond that the level of challenge is consistent: the puzzles are both so difficult and so elegant that there's no telling which ones you'll find easier than others. It all depends on whether that flash of intuition strikes you sooner or later. Fortunately, the worlds are designed in such a way as to allow you to skip quite a few of the puzzles, so if you find yourself stumped on one, you can work on another.","Oh my god this game is perfectGreat level design. Perfect example of \"show don't tell\" when introducing players to new mechanics.","I'm not a big puzzle game guy, but this game just pulls you in with its charming aesthetic and gentle introduction to its mechanics. 10\/10 Baba is Love","This is a really great puzzle game that does everything a puzzle game should.

Usually I get the basics of a puzzle game down alright and start to see solutions, but this stumped me for much longer than they normally do.This is not a point against it, but I was on the fence of buying it, so out of fear that Id have to rely on walkthrough from the word go to make progress, I refunded it until such a time where it goes on sale, as paying 13 euros for a game that I get stuck on even 10 levels in isnt that motivating. Having play countless adventure games with obscure solutions and puzzle games, I felt pretty thick when it all came together, which is generally a positive experience, but its something I expect a few levels into it after grasping the basics, and unfortunately I just never felt like I understood the basic stuff.","GA  is  GO\nME      OD","This game is wayyyyyyyy tooo hard. I love it.","This might be my all-time favorite puzzle game. The system is so flexible that it all comes down to puzzle design, and that's expertly executed, so that solving each puzzle requires understanding its concept, yet solving them is smooth enough that you don't get hung up on uninteresting details.","This is my favorite puzzle game in a long time. It's fairly difficult, but offers a lot of branching so you can easily skip certain levels when you get stuck. Highly recommend. If you find the wobbly graphics tiring, you can turn them off in settings. There is also a deceptive amount of game here, much longer than I expected.","This game is well worth its price. It's fun, it's cute, it's amazingly clever and hella difficult. I checked solutions to two levels online simply because I couldn't wrap my head around them to the point where I was convinced they were impossible to solve.

Simple, simple mechanics, relaxing and oddly meditative, immense emergent depth. A completely unique game, constantly twists your brain in ways no other game has.","This game, and I do NOT say this lightly, is one of the best puzzle games I have ever played, if not the best. The base mechanic of changing rules is very easy to pick up on, but is very easy to add complexity to for harder puzzles. And for the harder puzzles, this game does difficulty perfectly. Because of the undo button, death is not a punishment, merely an obstacle. And for a puzzle game of this caliber, it doesn't need to be punishment to \"increase difficulty\". The puzzles are hard enough for your brain that the game still feels super hard without being frustrating, and that is what this game excels at.The level design itself is also very good. Most sections of the game revolve around a specific mechanic they introduce, and the first puzzle in that section is a level that tutorializes the mechanic while still being a good puzzle. It's the best way of integrating learning the game into it, because you do not need any outside guide for this game at all.Overall, this game is top notch and got me motivated enough to leave a review for it. 10\/10, game of the year so far 100%. I cannot stress enough how much I adore this game.","GAMEISHARD","Absolutely one of the best puzzlers I've ever played.  Plenty of content and an excellent premise.  The player is given time at the beginning of each area to learn the new mechanics for that area before the difficulty is ratcheted upward.

Gets hard really fast and players might suffer frustration, but I still recommend it. 100% worth the price if you like to torture your brain every now and then.","Baba Is You is truly innovative, and another fantastic example of how a game can last a long time if it has just one solid mechanic at its core. However, I personally cannot recommend it on the basis of its puzzles.Most times, Baba's puzzles felt unintuitive, with so many steps along the way to the solution that I just couldn't find the patience to clear them - and let's face it, having to spoil a game by looking up a walkthrough isn't very fun. \"Causing surprising interactions\" just isn't interesting anymore when almost 100% of the time, you're stuck on the wrong ones.However, 98% of user reviews can't possibly tell a lie, so if you're a big puzzle fan, you're probably better off giving it a chance.TL;DR If you're a bumbling idiot like I am, Baba is You isn't for you.","Fantastic puzzle game, cannot recommend enough.","Baba is me?Lose is cry?Me is cry.","Just great!Positives:- Concept has never been used before- Very challenging- Not all puzzles are required to be solved in order to progress- Cool art style- Often there are multiple ways to solve a levelNegatives:Found only two minor things to criticize:- Music is repetetive- There should be an option to reduce the \"wobble\" effect rather than an On\/Off switchSo if you like puzzle games, i definetly reccomend you to try this one.","It's really really good. It's mostly not hard it's just you're blind","Baba is You is probably my favorite puzzle game of all time. It's extremely intuitive and solving the levels makes you feel like a genius. The basic concept is very simple but the game keeps expanding on it in interesting ways. The graphics, music and atmosphere in general are perfect for the kind of game it is and they allow you to concentrate on the logics behind a level.And that's definitely important, because Baba is You quickly gets very challenging. There is a huge amount of levels so you can get a lot of value for your money here but the difficulty really ramps up at some point.This is the only downside of the game in my opinion. It's easy to get stuck on a level if you don't understand what to do. I've spent minutes upon minutes in certain levels and to no avail. Be prepared to grind your brain gears at full speed. And remember to take breaks to cool it down every now and then.I'm pretty much stuck on all the levels I currently have access to but I still find myself returning to the game again and again.

The design of the levels is also worth of celebration, as they do not suffer from the common puzzle problem. You cannot immedeatly get hints to the solution though how the levels are designed. the levels have some artistic extra to help disguise your options, and actually led to genuine discovery.also it runs impressivly snappy. start up times under 3 seconds, and instant close times!","I'm too dumb for this","Believe the hype!","This game is ingenious in many ways. But I will start with the flaws first, because, to get to the good, you must overcome the bad first:1. Weird level number titling. It would definitely benefit if the creator of this game can maybe slumps the levels in one area into a chain, and then goes on to the next ones. It would definitely be weird to go from Level 9 to Level 13 in an instant.2. Not enough instruction: A little bit nit-picky here, but it would help to explain to the players what would happen, when either an object is not under a rule, how the \"MOVE\" function works, how the game would go if there were multiple Babas, or something like that sort.3. No hints: As will be discussed later on, this game executes an ingenious idea, but if solely based the game on that idea, it will have to resort to harder levels. That's where hints would definitely helps. Maybe lines to tell you what rules should be reached by the end, or a picture of the final scene.4. Restart mechanics: It would definitely help to have a function to allow direct restart, rather than having to drag the cursor to agree, in a game where you will definitely reset the level at least twice.5. Windowed playing is a chore: As a person who likes to multi-task, I would almost always window apps, to use it concurrently. But the windowed version of this app takes that to a default Sticky Note sized application, and it is very annoying.6. The \"IS\" and \"AND\" button should standout more, preferably with colors that are not darker than whatever they are right now.That's my bad points, albeit ultra-nitpicky. Now, here are the goods:1. Ingenious idea of literally rule-changing. I do not want to imagine the amount of codes that amount to this game, being a developer myself.2. Smart levels and designs. The ability to change everything based on blocks of text really helps, and with a wide variety of verbs and nouns to describe everything, it allows for a low of creative mash-up of rules.3. The \"AND\" function, multi-rule, and chain rule: It adds more, not only to the possibilities, but also to the level of difficulties that can be achieved.What would I wish for?1. Level creating. It would be quite a toll on an indie game, but believe me, this would be catalyst for so many level extensions and level updates. Allowing community levels and using some of the mechanics in those levels are extremely smart and resourceful.2. Probably anything I have listed in the bad section?Now, it looks like I have stated more bad here, but believe me, people will appreciate the nit-pickiness that I have put in here, because it cannot get any worse than whatever I have said here. And also, if looked carefully enough, the bads I have listed are much more detailed and small, while the goods I have listed revolved around the magnificent mechanics this game holds, can hold, and will hold. I cannot wait for this game to grow more.","Baba is You is a unique puzzle game, with principle that can be changed in order to complete each level.

No deep logic behind such levels, and you basically should randomly discover a weird rule (or look for hints). It discourages to solve a puzzle more than a couple hours, because you start to think that maybe it is again some weird combination of in-game rules, and exhaustive search is the only reliable method.But such cases are rare (but quite frustrating), so it is not a reason to not a buy a game.","One of the most interesting puzzle games I've ever played.","good game but too hard for my peanut brain","Fantastic puzzle game with a very unique mechanic and tons of content.

Your aim is to manipulate the rules of the game, which are expressed via boxes of text that can be rearranged, in order to win. Genuinely fantastic puzzles that deliver those aha moments where your perspective shifts and you feel very smart or very silly.","This game is okay, if you take every level and every rule on its own.  The rules are applied inconsistently between levels and within levels.  For example, you can win on a floating object, but you can push a floating object.  Water can be floated over, but a hedge cannot. Nor can a wall.  Most of the levels are pretty easy to solve, once you finally see the solution.  You get mad at yourself for making them complicated.  But part of that madness comes from seeing a level through the rules as they are written or as they may have been applied on a previous level, so you filter those options out.  If it were polished, I would say it's great, but these problems are really at the core of the game, and I cannot overlook them, so while it's a decent puzzler, it's a $5 game, at best, or a freebie someday, not a $15 game.","This game is genius. To be honest, I'm not a huge fan of puzzle games. I got Stephen's Sausage Roll gifted to me and despite being widely claimed as the \"best puzzle game of all time\" I had issues with it being way too overwhelming and hard.

It's more in line with something like The Witness, where every puzzle is it's own minigame. You instantly get and know the rules, you can instantly see what blocks you have access to, but it's still fiendishly difficult. Every time I get a solution I have a \"Eureka!\" Moment, and it feels like I appreciate how genius the puzzle design is every level. Amazing game, great for all audiences. As a bonus it teaches basic programming logic very well. .","Great game!finally somone with a new game idea and original design!","Baba is indeed you; but so are many other things. Don't be so full of yourself, slugcat...","I'm a creep. I'm a weirdo. What the hell am I doing here?I don't belong here.","It's a block pushing puzzle game based on simple predicate logic. The game does well to teach you the mechanics as you go, but one of the knacks of this game is remembering that only the mechanics that are explicit on screen are in effect. It's quite easy to miss that doors don't block movement on a particular level.","Possibly one of the best puzzle games ever made.Insanely creative, and really forces you to think outside the box.","Baba is amazing.I am not even usually into puzzle games, but the very intuitive way puzzles work in Baba and the infinite amount of possibilities (baba is turing complete, with the right rules you could make a platformer with it) make it both accesible and deep to a level I dont know any other puzzle game that could match it.","Baba Is You is an amazing puzzle game that plays on object assignment and property manipulation unlike any other puzzle game I've seen before. It's executed very well. You are able to beat worlds without too much, but its the later levels in each world that really push your solving skills.","Dev Is Creative","Baba is You and Awesome!","Baba is You... at least until you decide that Baba isn't good enough for the level and start transforming You into all sorts of other things.The main premise is simple logic. Words appear on screen that give the rules for the level. You have some control over the rearrangement of the words, provided you have access to them in the proper order. Push, pull, etc. the words and objects until you fulfill a stated win condition in the rules for the level. Sounds simple. Wrong. VERY WRONG.Levels will almost immediately start forcing you to think outside of the box to discover proper answers to levels. Yes, this does actually mean that sometimes a winning answer to a level isn't the right one, as all of a sudden you get a repeat level designed to make that previous solution unsolvable. It will require some experimentation on your part to see what does and doesn't cause a fail state in a level, but have no fear. You can undo moves and reset the level with a push of a button.This also applies to the sheer ability to pick up and play the game.It should take no more than a minute between the game finishing a boot up and you getting into a level, and gameplay can be contained into mere minutes of free time. Very few games possess this ability, really allowing you to play at one's leisure.And of course, we can't forget the best part.Rose is RedViolet is BlueFlag is WinBaba is YouOne of the best puzzle games I've seen, let alone played. Sublime in just how far presumably simple mechanics can be extended into the Full Metal Jacket of cranial boot camps that is Baba is You. The only thing that would make it perfect is a good soundtrack...Which it has.Rock Solid 9\/10. Highly recommend to even the least interested in puzzle games due to its pick-up-and-play ability.

It's unique. It's great. Mind bending puzzle game. It's challenging, but really well designed. It throws new concepts at you in quiet a high pace. Which would be my only critique, it could have a bit more gentle learning curve, where concepts are taught and later raised in difficulty (think the witness), instead of trowing the player into cold water by the minute. But that's really a minor issue compared to what is has to offer. If you're into puzzle games this is a must buy.","This might be the best puzzle game I have ever played. One of the few games in my steam library I paid full price for and would do it again. The concept seems so simple, yet whenever you encounter a new keyword you are just amazed at how the hell there are there more words\/mechanics left.","BABA IS DOOR.","I was waiting to post a review until I finished but there are just so many puzzles and I really want to talk about this game.This game is phenomenal. The creativity of the core puzzle mechanic is equally matched by the creativity of the puzzle design. The sign of a good puzzle game is that goosebumps feeling once the eureka moment kicks in on a puzzle. I've lost count of how often that's happened to me in this game. LAVA\/ICE IS PUSH PogBeyond the puzzles, the art style is delightful but also, importantly, simple. Your goal, the rules, and the current state of each puzzle is immediately clear at all times. The music is also really pleasant and suits the ponderous nature of the game. Garden and Forest songs stick out in my head.My only gripe is really minor but it held me up on one puzzle for a while. When you \"die\" (there are no entities \"IS YOU\"), the only button hints at the top tell you to restart or undo. But they leave out an incredibly important third option...I won't say what it is but that simple UX issue cost me a lot of time on an early puzzle. Granted, the puzzle was still tough knowing that but not tough enough to warrant all that timeOther than that (which I think was really partly my fault), the puzzles and mechanics in this game are crystal clear and the only thing stopping you from solving is your own blockhead. The core mechanic is refreshingly creative and forces you to think outside the box constantly. If this doesn't describe a good puzzle game, I don't know what does. You are seriously missing out if you don't play this.It's the kind of game that makes you jealous because you didn't think of it.","This game makes me feel smart for doing better than the streamers I watch, yet at the same time stupid for not figuring out the answers to some of them without having to look at youtube solutions. Worst of all it makes me feel inadequate because this is a genius idea that will unlikely ever come from my head.10\/10 would recommendAlso the music is great","Ever since I first saw \"Baba is you\" (it had 8 or so levels then and was distributed as a .zip archive), I knew it is going to be a stupidly great game one day. It is baffling that something so simple in its core has only appeared now, and it is absolutely, disgustingly fascinating.It has everything that you expect from a puzzle game, and even more that you don't.GAME            isGOOD","Brain is DefeatI am edit Review for Steam :)","This is a charming little puzzler that hides brain-wrinkling puzzles behind its primitive\/minimalistic art style. Love it!","Baba is you is a mindblowing game that will start out simple and progressively get more complex as you go along. By the end it is very complex, but the solutions are often simpler than you'd expect. In the beginning you'll just enjoy the game for its uniqueness. By the middle, you'll enjoy the game for the sense of accomplishment every time you beat a level. By the end, you will enjoy the game for every twist and turn and change the game pulls. At that point, you simply desire to push on to see how the game can surprise you next, and at the very end... When all is done, you'll look back at the entire journey that took you there, and you'll see how this game somehow made you grow not just as a player, or a puzzle solver, but as a person. To persevere through this game is incredibly rewarding and satisfying. Every time you solve something you've been stuck on, it's like a weight is lifted off your shoulders.That doesn't even begin to touch on the flavor of this game. It's bizarre and adorable and yet so... driven by rules. Everything feels like it all fits together, like all these characters are simply mindless pieces of a jigsaw puzzle, but they're all so cute and lovable. The music fits the flavor perfectly, and also makes for great thinking music. The soundtrack grew on me a lot as I played it, to the point that I really adore it now and I'm wondering if Hempuli's been brainwashing me.I couldn't recommend this game any more than I already do. (Also, as of writing this, I have 52 hours in the game. I've 100% completed it. The game has seriously impressive longevity for a game with little replay value. There's no point to replaying the same puzzles, save for a few special cases, but the game has so many puzzles that by the end you won't feel like you've been cheated out of your $15)","Brilliant game.  I hope this comes to IOS - it would be perfect as a portable game or something for Apple TV!","I really wanted to like this game. I thought the concept of manipulating words to create sentences that effect the level was really interesting and creative. But so many of the puzzles revolve around weird and unintuitive movement mechanics that much of the game just left me feeling frustrated.Some of the things the game expects you to do feel like glitches, and not something it seems like you should be able to do. Often I would repeatedly try to solve a puzzle, sometimes for  over an hour, until I would eventually get fed up and look up the solution online. And more often than not it ends up being some ultra-specific thing that doesn't make sense why it even works. And the game doesn't do a very good job of introducing you to all the little engine quirks it expects you to know by the end of the game either.Due to the the quasi-programming nature of the sentence building mechanics, I also thought this was going to be the type of game where puzzles could have multiple solutions. But the vast majority of the levels have only one. (And from what I've seen online, the developer has even updated the game to remove solutions he had not intended.) I know most puzzle games are like this, but it's just another reason why I was disappointed by this game.I usually like puzzle games. And I did enjoy a lot of the puzzles in this one. But for every enjoyable puzzle, there were several frustrating ones inbetween. Maybe I'm just not smart enough for Baba Is You. Judging by all the positive reviews it's very likely you'll enjoy it more than I did. But I personally can not recommend it.","Baba is You is  basically Sokoban with MORE mechanics. I actually hate Sokoban to be honest, but Baba is You is the best puzzle game I've ever played, and I've played quite some puzzle games in my time.There's a lot of deep and intelligently designed content in this game that challenges you in many different and always new ways. Most levels are very open and you can be quite creative with your solution.The visual style is also very, very cute and saying all the dumb sounding phrases out loud, while you're thinking about a solution, is quite fun.The only aspect of the game, that isn't 'perfect' in my opinion, is the music. While it is quite good music to think to, I wouldn't enjoy listening to it in my free time. Some 'cuter' music that matches the visuals would have been nicer, but it's alright.A level editor is also being developed right now, which would provide infinite content once released, making this game almost perfect to be honest.","If you're not playing this game then, quite frankly, there's no hope for you.","Baba is You is not that fun. Sure it is innovative, but most puzzles after 2-3 hours are based on one specific interaction of its rules that are unintuitive. At the same time, those unintuitive solutions are what allows the game to show how far the \"rewrite the rules\" mechanic can go. The direction that the game goes at the end really cool and unique but getting there (or solving the puzzles at that point in the game) is not that fun.After about 2 hours the puzzles start to become a chore to solve, and I started too look up solutions more and more because I didn't want to spend half an hour trying to solve 1 puzzle. There are also a couple of puzzles which use moon logic (see Prison - Dungeon). I eventually gave up and just looked up the ending portion of the game where Baba is LevelI still think its worth looking at even if it is only fun for 2 hours","A unique, fun, and particularly challenging entry to the puzzle genre. If you're like me and you like games that fit into the loosely defined \"puzzle\" genre, but think that most tend to be too easy, this game should strike your fancy. The soundtrack suits the game but it could have been a little more interesting melody-wise.I'm still playing through it, but so far I've enjoyed it enough to heartily recommend it to any people who are browsing the reviews and think the game might be up his or her alley. I bought it at full price and I'm please with my purchase.","In the sweetspot between \"there is the one perfect solution\" and \"build something that kinda works i guess\"","This is where I wish Steam had a more nuanced review system than Thumbs Up, Thumbs Down.Is Baba is You a detailed, novel, innovative game that deserves the praise it's getting? Yes, absolutely. Have I enjoyed playing it? No. Would I recommend it to other people? Also no.In a game supposedly about changing the rules to win in your own way, a lot of the challenges seem to revolve around one very specific solution that most often is completely unintuitive. There's a whole lot of mechanics that aren't explained very well. I found myself looking up solutions more often than not, and that's not something that's fun to do when you're playing a puzzle game. Part of the appeal of a puzzle game for me is learning the game's internal logic and becoming better at the puzzles even as they get harder. Baba is You obviously wants me to think in a different way, and occasionally, very occasionally, I can tune my brain to its wavelength and ace a puzzle which probably left other people stuck for hours. But those moments are too far apart for me. Just because I didn't enjoy the game, doesn't mean it'll be the same for you, but I can't recommend it on the basis of the experience I had.","Baba is HardsinceMe is DumbbutMe is Not MadsinceBaba is Cute ^3^","Ow. My brain. Must play more.","Baba Is Worth","Baba Is You is just an incredible, unique puzzle game. I remember when Vinny from Vinesauce streamed this game at launch and it's probably been to date the fastest I've bought a game upon first seeing it, I was immediately hooked. The whole concept of changing the rules of the puzzle to solve it is not only a concept well explored in the many puzzles that are featured, but also creates an amusing metaphysical narrative in the midst of the interactions, such as where the lack of identity means you, the player, no longer have control over the world, or certain objects or characters are annihilated from existence just from redefinition.I recommend this game if you are a fan of brain-busting, out-of-the-box lateral thinking required puzzles. Even if you aren't, I'd still say give it a shot, the game does a good job of easing into the mechanics. At launch there were a few puzzles whose mechanics were not introduced gracefully enough, but patches since then have worked to pace this progression better, making this game even better than when it started.It's also deceptively long. The time I have clocked doesn't even take into account the extra hours I spent thinking of solutions to some puzzles. Well worth the money.","Rose is Red.Violet is Blue.Baba is not not hot.Me is weak.Empty is me.","The idea is cool but the logic doesn't make much sense when you get into the game.

Good music.","My third eye has opened to the truthGOTY","I hate this game. It makes me feel like an idiot.I love this game. It makes me feel like a genius.","This is a puzzle game that will make you stuck very long for some of the levels, thinking of several hours (or days) and when you suddenly have the idea you will like you are a genius (for figuring out the solution) and a idiot (for not think about that earlier) at the same time. The core idea is simple, but very flexible with enormous number of possible combinations which provided a lot of twists and surprise to the game play. In some levels there are also multiple way to solve the level. There are also a lot of levels (200+), divided into \"worlds\" which most of them introduce some new mechanics. Also, with the editor (which is not intended for players to use but there is one in the game) I can't wait to see how this game will become and what players will create in the future. Pros: Genius ideas and mechanics A lot of levels, some are really good at cleaver misdirection Level editor (which might be publicly open in the future) Fitting graphics and musicCons: Somewhat down if stuck on a level for way too longFinally, something obligatory: BA I  YO\nBA  S U\n\nI \n S\n \nWI\nN","The most clever puzzle game I've played in ages. This is a great, well designed game.","Love the game, love the concept. I however have two (Three but one is supposed to get fixed with an update later on) issue with the game :- There is no level editor (Should be present in a future update I heard)- There are no in-game tips. Now I'm not asking for tips to show whenever you want but a system like a very vague tip on how to solve the level after 15 minutes of being stuck like an idiot on a level would be nice. I really don't want to ruin the game by looking at guides that spoil the levels for me- The 15$ asking price seems way too high for this kind of game. Not an absurd price of course but to me, 10$ would have been better to swallow. Though for how fun the game is I don't really mind having spent 5$ more than what I would have liked","BABA IS ME AND STUPID","I think \"Mind bending\" is the word I'm looking for.It's a game you simply have to experience (both the idea, and the execution full of unique, interesting and fun puzzles), even if you don't play it to completion.I do think the curve is too steep, the difficulty quickly goes up. I often find myself struggling with a puzzle and thinking \"I need to solve some easier puzzles first to get my head wrapped around the mechanics\", but the easier puzzles are not there in sufficient quantity.I hope the game will be updated with more puzzles of varying difficulty to fill the gaps. On the plus side, the progression is mostly nonlinear, so if you struggle with one puzzle you can try others and go back to it later.","-","This game is a perfect example of how too much freedom can absolutely melt youfadssjdfkljadsf","Baba is You is one of the best puzzle games I've played in years- maybe the best one ever. For a game made by a single developer, it shows an incredible amount of depth and complexity. I feel like it shines the most in the later levels, once several concepts are thrown together and the player is allowed to mix them together and see what works well. My only complaint about the game is that a handful of solutions were so out of left field the only way I ever would have thought of them is to mess around until I accidentally stumbled upon them (which happened on more than one instance). If you've got a friend who enjoys puzzle games, I would actually suggest playing through with them. Having a second person to bounce ideas off of really helped me out and made the experience a lot more fun than on my own, when I could be stumped for over an hour on a single level.","Delightful, clever, and challenging. With a lot of good surprises. A must play for anybody who likes tough puzzle games such as Stephen's Sausage Roll."],["best puzzle game there is tbh","Real gem of a puzzle game. Definitely one of the best I have ever played. Added bonus of sounding insane when talking yourself though a puzzle.","This game is absolutely incredible! At first I was worried having the rules of the level being malleable would make it a tad easy, but rest assured that is wholly not the case. This game is tough as nails, though (once you understand the rules of the game) is completely fair! It's also stuffed full of content that never repeats itself; all the levels and areas feel extremely unique! Also, the game still retains its cutesy charm after staring at it for over 24 hours, which is very impressive. BABA IS GOOD. So good.","Lodenstein IS NOT Puzzler AND IS BadHASLoveFORGame","exceptional","A really good puzzle game","BABA IS YOU\nGAME IS HARD AND GOOD\n   STUPID","A really great game. Challening though, but I found a great deal of fun trying to work out different solutions for each puzzle.","This game best represents the indie spirit. Its rule-changing mechanism is very simple yet deep. And it grants the game extra layers and fun.","So, I finally completed the entirety of the game.The game is very unique and interesting with more than 200 puzzles, but some of them are HARD. I see myself as an expert when it comes to solving puzzles, but there were still a bunch of them that took me more than an hour to solve and that appeared to be impossible.If you like REALLY REALLY hard puzzles like me, then this is definitely something for you.If you just want to solve puzzles easy and quickly, then you may enjoy most levels, but many other ones in this game will overstrain you and take too long for you too solve.I'm giving this game a positive review, because of it's very unique style and because making such an amount of incredibly difficult puzzles is also a difficult task and not something you will see very often.","Baba is You challenges you to think outside the box, then take that box and use it to think outside reality.On the surface, it's a super simple block pushing game where certain block arrangements have neat little effects. But once you peel back the cutesy veneer, you discover that the blocks actually form a declarative programming language that alters every single aspect of the rules, and reality.From almost the word 'go', you'll be transforming walls into sheep, making lava fly, creating duplicates of yourself to turn into rocks, and pushing the void. The act of simply discovering all of the ridiculous reality alterations you can do and how those fit neatly into clever puzzles is so satisfying and compelling that you tend to always want to do more after you've just finished a batch of them. And there is always more. Way, way more. Over 200 puzzles total, to be precise. And they keep throwing new things in so it doesn't ever get stale.That said, that length also ends up being somewhat of a drawback. The hardest puzzles are tough. Really, really tough. You'll be spending hours on them. As such, I recommend putting this game down when you have other mentally-demanding tasks to do, because the multiple dozens of hours of brainwracking it puts you through can legitimately give you a headache if you're not careful.","BABA IS WIN","Love this game.It makes me think out of the box.","~50 levels into the game. Loving it a lot! Truly outstanding game!","This quickly became one of my all-time favorite games. An astounding wealth of gameplay, with difficulties ranging from trivial to nigh impossible. The perfect balance of simple core mechanics in endlessly complex combinations.The graphics are actually a huge strength. Simplifying the look and feel gives the developer a lot more freedom to push the limits of the gameplay, and gives the player a reliable context. Almost any level can be solved simply from a screenshot.If you enjoyed Portal or any other similar puzzle game, you'll be both charmed and thrilled by Baba Is You.","Just a fantastic puzzle game from start to finish. If you watch two minutes of the game or the trailer and think it looks fun, then you will certainly get dozens of hours of enjoyment (and occasional frustration) out of this game.","Baba is YouGame is Hard and Good","Baba is You is not really a sokoban game. Expecting something like Kickle Cubicle is not going to happen here, On the other hand it is a game of simple grammatical relationships similar to the puzzle games found in zachtronics releases, but somehow more pleasant and pulled off with a twist of the sentence that makes it memorable. Baba is You is exactly the weirdness of baby talk blended with so many good ideas and so many fun plays on the possibility of it's grammar that it becomes really something special. It's a little indie gem that made me smile and also managed to make me think in ways I had not before. If you love this genre this is a good reward.","This game makes you feel like a genius sometimes. Other times, you will wonder how you ever made it this far in life. It's not extremely complicated or complex, but isn't easy by any means. The solutions will usually be in front of your eyes, and most of the times you will figure out each of the pieces, and all you have to do is apply the mechanics of the game. That being said, I breezed through a lot of the game until I hit this one particular level. I spent one hour coming up with idea's and complex idea's that were not supported by the mechanics of the game, thus weren't possible solutions. I tried so many combinations, and I felt like I was so close every time, yet I got thwarted back from the end screen. I took a little break and it hit me, that all this time that I spent thinking about these other solutions, I skipped over a much easier solution. An hour in a puzzle game is not the same as in other games. It's an hour that your brain is working hard. An hour that you are being frustrated by failure. An hour that kicks you straight in the balls for messing up. So, when I finally returned to the game, to find such an easy solution, I decided that I needed to recommend this game. Because so many puzzle games sometimes feel unfair, or makes the player feel cheated. Not this one, this one just slaps you in the face by showing you a mirror of how dumb you are. It's a good feeling that you'll remember for a while and it brands the game with a unique aura, for having some many levels that are sooo easy, but still make you feel like a genius because of how clever they are.","Love this game, love the style, the music, and I particularly love the mechanics. It's a great puzzle game that will very much test your critical thinking skills.However, I do have two problems with the game. Firstly, this game has wildly varying difficulty in some places, one level might be very easy, the other would keep you up for days trying to figure it out. While almost every level early on is relatively simple in practice, the difficulty curve spikes pretty early on.Secondly, this game is updated way too much. Since it's release, it's received updates every 1-3 days, and these updates aren't just bugfixes or minor changes, some of them change entire levels or the order of these levels. This renders a lot of solutions are that are already online completely obsolete and creates a differing experience between you and other people.I do recommend the game, but be aware that the game is both extremely hard, and updated with major changes very frequently.","this game pleases my girlfriend more than i probably ever could.thank you!? i guess?!...","Good soundtrack, cute art style and some of the most fiendish puzzles imaginable.BIY is a severely good game that will absolutely destroy your brain. Somewhere out there, theoretically, is someone who's beaten every single level without a hint, and they're some sort of godlike being who could enlighten and uplift all of Earth's societies.Instead they're playing puzzle games.","For the longest time, puzzle games have had to meet certain criteria to be enjoyable experiences. Entries in the genre had to straddle a paper-thin line between too easy and too hard. Games that are too easy can insult the player's intelligence, while games that are too hard achieve their difficulty through frustratingly arbitrary riddles or needless complexity that makes you bust out the ol' pen and paper and doesn't lend itself to fun very well.I picked up this game about two weeks ago and didn't stop playing until I had achieved 100%. Baba is like no puzzle game I've ever seen before because it takes this preconceived line that a good puzzle game has to balance on and throws it in the trash. Perfect difficulty curve aside, every puzzle gradually introduces a fresh idea to discover without always introducing a new mechanic. The core principle of the game is introduced immediately and the little quirks of the engine have a myriad of applications, all of which you will learn to exploit to your advantage. (EDIT: I was never as glad to be so wrong. It is of course not \"all\". It had the foresight to save some of the most absurd leaps of logic for custom levels.) The sky is the limit with the solution to a Baba puzzle. The game never hand-holds, never insults your intelligence, and never uses any solution you can't figure out from a VERY close and deep look at the problem. Rest assured you will be entertained if you stick with it. This game is cool as balls but not for impatient people. The most mind imploding parts of Baba is You are in places that 0.1% of players will reach without a guide. Keep in mind that the game STARTS with playing sokoban with the game rules, and just gets better from there...14\/10 best game of all time (for me personally), undoubtedly best puzzle game of all time looking only at the puzzles themselves.","This game makes my brain hurt very mucho","The average Baba Is You level is deliciously obviously impossible. Baba's puzzles are not hard because they have a thousand different things to try. They are hard because they have 2 things to try, both of which obviously cannot work.Which makes the \"Aha!\" moments -- \"Oh! You just do this!!\" -- so sweet.This game has so many new ideas. There is no filler.","Brilliant game for not so brilliant players.","My head hurts playing this game.","by area 2 you can see that the real gimmick is what you cant interact with instead of what you can do","BABA IS YOUBRAIN IS MELT","GAME OF THE YEAR!!!!!!!!!","The smartest, most creative, most original, most adorable, and most mind-bending puzzle game I've ever played. If you want my advice, never look up the answers, or even take hints, you'll feel like a genius once you finally figure out the hardest puzzles. There's tons of levels that all feel finely-crafted, and the hardest puzzles require not only your understanding of how the commands function with each other, but how the commands themselves (and you) interact with the world (and you). A very, VERY smart game. The only thing that'd make it for me is if it had a level creator, and it seems like it'd fit right in given how modular the game seems in its construction. I highly recommend Baba Is You to anyone looking for the best and most original puzzle game since Portal 2.","When I started playing this game, I knew something was up, but I stuck with it and didn't refund it.Now I 100%'ed it and honestly, it's not good.90% of this game is anything but \"Baba Is You\". It's full of mini-games or Sokoban with extra steps. Only in the 10% of the playtime are you actually figuring out the mechanics of the game.The pacing of the levels (assuming you play them in numerical order) are all over the place, tutorial levels barely explain new mechanics and some levels are completely out of place, either being too hard\/not in the area's theme or being too easy\/time wasting. It really feels like the dev just found some quirks with it's game mechanics and just sprinkled them out  trough the levels with 0 thought put in.Far too often you come into a level just to be met with a CVS receipt of already set rules that you can't change. Then you have to mentally exhaust each and every interaction you can think of and then pat yourself on the back for finding the solution.The ~200 levels is both too much and too little. After completion I felt like I still don't have an intuitive understanding of many mechanics and also that I wasted quite a bit of time solving levels that nether were hard nor thought me anything about the game.Nothing felt intuitive, nothing felt smart and not a single level made me say \"aha!\".Lastly, an open letter to the developer: Why the  are you changing levels post-release?","Fantastic pure puzzle game. The design is both simple and ingenious- you construct and change rules from the text blocks on screen in order alter each puzzle to make it winnable. No reflexes, no aiming, just you and your brain versus a clear system of rules for you to figure out. There is quite a lot of content, and it does get pretty difficult. There's even a level editor. You get a lot of value for such a cheap indie game. Highly recommended.","This is the perfect puzzle game, it encapsulates everything the genre should be","i like this game and we share the same name so that's pre cool","Really makes you think differently to solve each puzzle. Frustrating at times, but there's always that \"aha\" moment when the solution clicks. Also, not sure why, but I've grown really attached to Baba and co over the course of playing this. Plays like a warm toasty cup of soup on a rainy day.Fair warning though, if you're the kind of person who thinks they have a solution and *must* try to make it work, this game's puzzles aren't for you.","It's a wonder why people aren't raving about this game more. What a unique and innovative concept, designed by a brilliant mind, to be both intriguing and infuriating. Not only is it a great concept, but it is implemented fantastically, with so many levels that you are sure to get hours out of this game. All the puzzles are intriguing; some are manageable in the first few tries, others still elude me. The level system seems perfectly balanced so you'll never be truly stuck on one problem with nowhere else to go, but it still requires you to solve a decent number of puzzles to progress. Everything else about the game is simple and wonderfully built, so you can focus completely on solving the puzzles and exploring this ingenious system.On the technical side, I am so pleased by how the game works. It's available on Mac, it loads in an instant, and it barely takes up any of my (dwindling) disk space. I feel I can open it, play it for an hour, and tear myself away - knowing I can easily come back to it at any time. I'm so glad the creator has taken the time to code this so it runs so smoothly and efficiently.What a truly fantastic game, and well worth the asking price. Don't be fooled by the simple graphics - this game is as elegant and challenging as it gets.","I don't write many Steam reviews, and I don't like giving negative reviews in general. However, this is a game I can't recommend to anyone. The concept is neat, but most of the levels aren't any fun. The first couple dozen are good, and then after that it just becomes incredibly tedious. The majority of them have only a single solution, and the developer has even gone through to explicitly remove unintended ones. So when you solve a level you don't feel particularly creative, you just feel like you pushed objects around in the precise way the developer wanted you to.On top of this, a lot of levels are incredibly frustrating in that you have to do a series of multiple unintuitive things to solve them which means that even if you think you know part of the solution you still have to fight with the game in order to execute it and move on. This also makes it nearly impossible to play in tandem with another person because, unless that person was playing the game every moment with you or also playing on their own, they would never have enough information to be able to give you any useful suggestions.The level order is also really bad. The game isn't gated heavily, and so at any time you have a decent number of levels available to play. On the surface this seems good, but now that I'm at the halfway mark I find myself wishing all these levels were in a much more explicit order based on the skills you've demonstrated as a player so that the difficulty curve wasn't so random.~200 levels seems like a lot of levels, but this game has so many concepts that even with that number it doesn't feel like it would be enough to teach you all the things the game wants you to know to solve them. This game feels like it would have been better with half the number of areas and twice as many levels in each of them to smooth out the progression. I'm stuck on a few levels, and I really have no idea if going to a different area is going to show me anything that could become a hint for these levels so it feels like I may as well just look at a walkthrough or stop playing.I don't regret buying this game, but I think most people should stay away from it. It's not the kind of creative fun experience that you might assume it is.","The best puzzle game I've ever played, bar none.This game has a simple, creative concept that leads to an ample number of creative, and sometimes incredibly difficult, puzzles. The art style is simple and charming. The music is very pleasant to listen to. It's inexpensive. Some of the profits go to charity.There's no reason not to get this game.","Baba is superb.  The game is full of engaging and challenging puzzles right to the end.  It also avoids becoming rote through the introduction of new ideas and mechanics all the way through and by avoiding designs which fall back on repeated use of the same tricks to solve them.  I cannot rate this highly enough - well worth every moment.","Game is masterpiece","I feel so stupid. Love this game.","Baba is you is ridiculously innovative, clever, and mindblowing all at once. I laughed, I cried, I spent 40 hours of my life completing every puzzle and I don't regret a second of it. If you have even a casual interest in puzzle games, You. Must. Play. This.Baba is you.

It's rules are incredibly simple...but, that also means that they are easily mixed and matched and implemented in all sorts of combinations and manners of ways. Not to mention, it does the good game tutorial thing, where rather than telling you what to do, it just shows you what to do and leaves you to figure out the simple steps and then builds upon that. I can't remember the last time I've had such an emotional rollercoaster of an experience of feeling like a genius then like an utter idiot and so on. There are a few weirdnesses that may take a bit to figure out (e.g. Open doesn't just open things, but touches Close and has them both destroy each other), but once you understand the game's vocabulary, it's amazing how brilliant of an experience it ends up feeling to be.","It never ends.

Great implementation! ... very addictive! - Well done Sir!","Too difficult too quickly. Felt like I was dealing with advanced concepts once I hit around level 10, and the game felt too much like a mobile game. Also, some gameplay mechanics felt random and unintuitive.

I believe there are some unfair puzzles because of certain strange interactions that I feel the players should have learned in a tutorial level but there is still logic to the answers. I've only finished most of the game's content but even that was still a lot.","GA    IS    HAME           RD","A charming and addictive game.  Sometimes the levels are too rigid, preventing alternative solutions... which seems to be in direct conflict with the game's design philosophy, honestly.  I'll think I've come up with something really clever, only to find a lingering \"Skull is Sink has Wall\" that renders my solution impossible.  I wish the developers hadn't walled off (both literally and figuratively) many levels in this fashion.Levels with the rule \"Empty\" were the hardest, at least for me.  Also, the ones that require 'tile ballet', where multiple Babas must be moved in a very specific manner, weren't very fun.  I prefer the ones were you change the rules to solve the puzzles.The wiggle effect causes eye strain: if you have any vision problems (even minor) I recommend disabling it in the settings.Anyway, the game is definitely worth your time if you like puzzles.  You always have the option to set a level aside and come back to it later; I recommend doing so whenever you encounter an unnumbered, so that you can learn new tricks before facing a puzzle you can't solve.  You may even need to abandon whole zones until you've completed other areas, but don't give up!","One of the best puzzle games ever made.What makes the game great - its simple and beautiful difficulty - will make some people angry though.","ME IS DUMBISWIN","Best puzzle game I have ever played!","BabaIsYouIs HardIsIsCuteIsGood","Previously, I had qualms about the near constant level changes during the first 6 months following release. Now that game has had time to mature I've been enjoying it once again. I highly recommend if you're into puzzle games to take a look at this.

Everything is driven by the core mechanic, which is one of the most innovative and novel systems I have ever seen in game software.","Probably my favorite puzzle game ever. Its unique and brilliant logic is just... whatever, there are tons of reviews that explain why it's so good. It just is.","Some of the logic on the puzzles was inconsistent is my only real complaint(some of the rules did not work on some levels). Fun challenging game tho, but it was a deal breaker and a refund based on that.","This game is fun, though I suck at it.This is one of the more unique puzzle games out there, like in most puzzle games I've played, the rules don't change. A specific entity does a specific action, and you have a list of moves you can do. However in this game, the rules are defined by the level. You can interact with the text defining the rules, but they also interact with the world. (e.g. an entity could walk into a a rule and change it)The level format is pretty standard, however at the start it's easy, but the difficulty increases fast. It doesn't have a steep learning curve, it's just the difficulty increases. It isn't necessarily bad. The first few levels you'll be able to get in one sitting, but then in your next few plays it'll be it bit harder to progress.It's nice to play this game it's nice to do a 'Slow Burn'. Beat 2 or 3 levels each try. And also, if you're stuck on a level for a long time, don't feel bad to look up walkthroughs. Like seriously, you'll need those.9\/10 - Would Brain is Hurt again","I first played this a few years ago as a game jam demo, and was pleasantly surprised to find it now fleshed out into a full game. Baba is You is almost hands down the most clever puzzle game I've ever played. So many of the solutions are incredibly clever, but at the same time very simple. \"Thinking outside the box\" may be a cliche, but this game absolutely personifies that phrase. The difficulty is fine for the most part; it's not as brutally punishing as say, Stephen's Sausage Roll, Space Chem, or TIS-100. Particularly since you're able to select from multiple levels at one time in a world, and you only have to beat a little over half of them to move on to the next world, so if you're stuck on a level you can just try a different one. The end game however, gets *incredibly* meta and brutally hard, and I fully admit to having to look up much of it in a guide. It's still really fun and very much worth playing through.Baba Is You joins The Talos Principle and Portal 2 as one of my favorite puzzle games of all time.","Wonderful game, absolutely worth picking up and if I recall correctly there's going to be a Level Editor coming up soon, so there's some replayability there.","Anybody who writes a negative review either wants to hate the game just cause, or hates puzzle games and this isn't for them. This game almost punishes you for overthinking.","Baba is You is a brilliant little Sokoban-style puzzle game where you quite literally have to break the rules to solve its puzzles, with tons of increasingly-creative solutions and \"Eureka!\" moments.

(Though every single one is great, I finished them all).","Far beyond my brain to comprehend but I'm glad it exists.","I've played computer games for quite a while, but this is really something new. Highly recommended."],["A fresh mind-blowing simple indie puzzle game. This game is a piece of art and a unique jewel. It has a nice learning curve, offer various incredible \"think out-of-the-box\" style challenges. Many levels will still be accessible even if you get stuck at a particular one, and the game is not punitive : you can cancel any of your moves whenever you want, not forced to start again from the initial setup.The crude graphics still create a very to-the-point atmosphere. The music participates nicely to this feeling, though it could be a bit repetitive at some points, which is frankly the only \"not-so-perfect\" point that I could find to write here.This is by far the best puzzle-game I ever played, completely different from the one I know.Try it, buy it. Alone or with friends, you won't be disappointed if you like games that surprise you \/ make you think differently.","I've decided that I am too dumb to play this game.About half way through it gets harder than The Witness. I'm not kidding you. I've spent hours just looking at a level.

Baba Is You features great level design that will force you to try everything you can think of. Thankfully, the game's \"undo\" button is an excellent control that allows you to to quickly and precisely test any of your ideas step-by-step.Of course, you are not expected to complete every single stage. Completing a fraction of the stages in an area will unlock the next one, and you will still find that there are a great number of stages to play.

My 8-year old thoroughly enjoyed it and kept talking about it after we've finished the initial playthrough. I was slightly concirned about the artstyle and it not being \"pretty\" but it looks better live because of animations.","Baba Is You is one of the best games I have ever played.

If the trailer and concept seems appealing to you, this is definitely something you should pick up. The soundtrack is pretty, the visuals are adorable and simple, which complement the game really well!! I am really happy with the cute aesthetic they gave this game, it makes all the puzzles really nice to look at. The puzzle\/level design is also always very fun, every time you get to the next level there's a whole lot more to unpack. It's really satisfying when you finally see the congratulations screen after trying some insane solution that you weren't sure would work. The game executes what it promises to give you perfectly. This is probably my favorite puzzle game of all time. Super super fun.","I saw this game at a friends house saturday evening. It's now sunday night (early monday morning really) and I've already sunk quite a lot of hours into it. It's really addictive. There are times when you'll scratch your head and wonder how on earth a particular puzzle is possible, but as long as you keep on trying out new things it will work out in the end. One of the very best puzzlers out there.","Just 100% completed Baba is You, and I feel comfortable saying this is a very good sokoban-style puzzle game. There is an enormous amount of content in this game, and for me and everyone I have talked with about the game, many of these puzzles take over an hour, sometimes up to 3 hours. There are some extremely clever smart puzzles, but also a few ones which feel a little unfair. It's unclear when a puzzle is trying to teach you a new mechanic, or whether you are supposed to just be using what you already know. The developer is actively patching the game and addressing these issues, so for me and numerous friends puzzles change between sessions as we are working on them due to these adjustments. There are definitely moments where after an hour of fiddling you find a new way the words can be used and it feels like these teaching levels should be much more limited to guide the player into learning the mechanic. They often have red herrings and many options which seem plausible but are incorrect. Many of the mechanics interact in unintuitive or quirky ways (namely Shift and Swap), and there are a bunch of rules in place that are unwritten (mostly around the words Text and Level). You just need to fumble your way through understanding these quirks and memorize them. Even with all those negative points, the number of really brilliant fair puzzles more than make up for them. This game is absolutely worth playing if you like puzzle games.","This game brainwashed me. Now I go about my day and my mind is like \"baba is you, you is baba, rock is baba you is move is baba stop is jelly baba stop is you ... ect\"","This is as close to perfect as a game can be. To be honest, it's nothing but just a bunch of arenas where you push things around. Yet, such a simple concept can be be turned to such a challenging and creative game, is hard to imagine until you play it. It's super fun but super-er hard.","This is the work of a genius! A masterpiece! Highly recommended and a must-have if you like puzzles and problems that are incredibly difficult to solve. Definitely not a 'shooty-shooty-pew-pew-do-this-and-do-that-and-you-win' game and does require a heck of a lot of patience and time. Starts very easy but gets deadly hard quickly. There are times when you will feel like some problems are absolutely impossible to solve. And that's where lies the fun!Rumour has it that a level editor is coming soon, and the community is already making extra levels so that's definitely a good thing. Love the soundtrack. Doesn't require a lot of CPU and GPU resource so it's possible for me to keep it running in the background and play during those hour-long trips in flight sims. If you are bored and would like to throw a bunch of very difficult challenges to throw at your brain from time to time, buy it. At around $15 dollars (11.39 in UK) the price is affordable too.","A cute, simple game at first, which gets genuinely complex over time.The puzzles are split into themed sections.Each section uses a bit different color scheme and introduces a new mechanic, on which it builds upon, until it gets really hard to solve.You don't have to do all puzzles though.

Levels can be tricky, (especially Extra levels), but solving them is always satisfying. My only complaint is that a non-trivial subset of levels basically devolve into Sokoban, where it's clear what you need to do, you just need to line up the various blocks properly, which is always tedious (particularly levels where you need to control multiple characters to push things at the same time).

Great, even. I loved the gimmick of this entire game and how it presented itself (graphically and musically). It's easy to pick up and play... but it's not easy to figure out most of those puzzles.I picked this up via word of mouth from a friend, thinking it'd be challenging but fair -- something like the Portal games, which I really enjoyed playing through. That held true for the first few levels, but then it just... skyrocketed in difficulty and complexity.I can only recommend the game to hardcore puzzle fans who REALLY want a challenge. I had to use a walk-through to get thorough most of the puzzles later in the game,  and... it didn't feel good. Either I had a moment of \"OH, I'm dumb!\", or a moment of \"How could anyone figure that out?\". The puzzles I DID figure out myself felt great - it's very reminiscent of the feeling you have in old retro games, where you have a really hard time with a stage, but when you get through you just forget it. Of course it's not the same here, but the feeling is similar.I see the appeal of this game, hence why I said it's a great game! Again, I really love how this game looks and how it sounds - the music is a perfect fit for the type of game, something chill and relaxing, helping dissipate some of the frustration you'll face with some of the puzzles... However, as it is right now, I can't recommend it unless you're a hardcore fan of this genre. Personally, I gave up after realising I couldn't solve ANY of the puzzles, in any of the worlds without a walk-through.","It's rare that I watch the video for a game and find myself giggling with glee at the base mechanic. Logic puzzles usually require you to make use of what there is, to change what there is, within the rules of what is. Here you change the rules of what is, turning the whole thing on its head. Bend your mind whilst altering reality! Highly recommended.","Good game","I like the game at its core. It's charming and accessible and Baba is a cute character. But this game is egregiously difficult. By far the hardest puzzle game I have ever played and I'm not even at the end of the game. There are so many new keywords and tricks to learn that it's hard to keep up with, and the syntax seems inconsistent at times. I think it's a good game, but I absolutely cannot recommend it unless you can get it for free or you have found every puzzle game you have played to be too easy.Another chief complaint is that when you start playing the game, it gives you a world of options. It lures you in with as many solutions as your creativity can muster up. That ends quickly. After an hour in the game at the most, the puzzles stifle creativity wherever possible and make absolutely sure that there's only one possible solution to most puzzles. So not only is the difficulty naturally ramping up, but it also artificially increases by telling you that your innovative and fun solutions aren't acceptable.","absolutely infuriating. 10\/10 anni is best","I must say the game is super hard but it is so satisfying when you find a  solution to a stage where you didnt even see the potential of a possible answere.

I love the brilliant game design, and really appreciate the mix of creative thinking and logical deduction required in the puzzle solving process. On top of that, you are continuously introduced to new mechanics and tricks as you progress, which helps keep the game new and engaging. I would highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys puzzle solving.The only thing I can complain about is the background music. While the sound effects are pretty good, the BGM gets a bit annoying for me personally and detracts from the puzzle solving experience, so I usually play my own music over it. I would prefer something that feels more relaxing or zen-like and helps me concentrate.","An absolute masterpiece of a puzzle game. As someone who drops puzzle games very quickly if they aren't interesting, this one held me over for 50 hours as I cleared every single level (on the Switch version). Even if you don't play puzzle games, absolutely pick this one up. It's expertly crafted from beginning to end.Edited for the 2019 Steam Awards. Lol.","Baba is You manages to be both brutally difficult and extremely accessible at the same time. In all the right ways, Baba reminds me of the Zachtronics games: from its difficulty curve, playing with logical systems, sandboxiness, and overall feeling of cleverness. As new concepts are introduced, the difficulty dips, before ramping up extremely toward the end of a set of levels to demonstrate your mastery of said concept. Thankfully you don't need to have completed every level of a set in order to progress, so you can flit back and forth between levels to try and learn new tricks that will help you with the harder levels that you found yourself stuck on before.For me, the sign of an excellent puzzle game is one that allows you to get stuck because you need to change your way of thinking. Baba is extremely successful on this front, as its entire premise is shifting the rules of the game, and by extension the way you interact with it. I'm nowhere near done with the game, but I've already had to walk away from it a couple of times to let solutions for the set of levels I'm on gestate in my subconscious. Coming back with a fresh perspective and hitting that \"A-ha!\" moment is the best feeling in a puzzle game, and Baba is just stuffed to the brim with such moments.I cannot recommend Baba enough. Just remember: if you get stuck, walk away, you probably need to come back with a fresh perspective to solve the level(s) you're on.","Absolute magnificence. One of the best puzzle games I've played, right up there with the Portals.The extremely simple yet absurdly creative system is very fun to work with, and has so many options for interesting puzzle design that it can have a couple hundred levels and EVERY SINGLE ONE introduces some kind of wacky new idea, which all-too-frequently blows my  mind. And it doesn't even have to pile on tons of new mechanics to do this. And even after the novelty of being able to do LITERALLY ANYTHING YOU CAN THINK OF wears off you're left with a well-executed, challenging and engaging puzzle game which respects the player's intelligence. No annoying tutorials here, and this is no easy game. But it doesn't throw stuff at you which you don't have the means to figure out, and you don't have to beat every level to progress so it never feels punishing.Visuals and audio aren't stellar like the gameplay but they get the job done.I cannot stress enough how often this game had me saying \"HOLY HELL I CAN (insert hilarious emergent gameplay feature)\". If you're even the tiniest bit interested in puzzle games I'm convinced you will find value in Baba Is You.","One of the best puzzle games I have ever played.  Worth the first few hours of kind of standard feeling gameplay to get to the mind bending meta fun that comes later.Suffers from a slower start, and while most of the puzzles utilize the amazing core gimmick, a few are pretty much movement puzzles that feel like that traffic jam game with the red car.

After a while, just about every puzzle's solution leaves you thinking \"what the fresh hell was that.\" I say this as lovingly as possible. If you're the type to insist on never looking up hints, you'll get hours and hours and hours out of this game. If you're the type who does look up hints...you'll probably still get hours and hours out of this.

A game mechanic that I have never seen before in this form, which makes it hard to name comparable games here.This game is the most \"bugged\" game I have ever played. For many of the later levels there is simply no solution. The only workaround is to search for the level in the background on Youtube and watch the video. Then suddenly your own game does what it's supposed to as well ...Seriously, many of the levels are really, really difficult. It makes you feel really stupid to watch a solution video after 3 days. Often you have the thought that you probably wouldn't have found the solution in 100 years on your own. But the moments in which you suddenly come up with the solution on your own are simply terrific.So, if you keep in mind that you are not necessarily as stupid as some of the levels make you feel, the game is enjoyable and as it is also very unique, I recommend you to try it as well.","Baba is youiswin","A MUST PLAYER FOR PUZZLE LOVERS","Puzzle is here.Here is brain.Brain is ."],["Only for people with 2000 Intelligence.","Great game with a great concept. Definitely try it.","I, a random internet stranger, completed every puzzle in this game, without any hints. Surely you won't let a random internet stranger one-up you, right?More seriously: This game is basically \"Think Outside Of The Box: The Game\". In almost every one of the 226 levels, you're given a box to think your way out of. You start with some nice boxes, moving on to more evil boxes one by one. New mechanics are introduced throughout the game, and the game wastes no time at all forcing you to use them in several utterly unorthodox ways each.The game has a very nonlinear worldmap, so if you get stuck on a few levels you can just go complete some other levels instead, then come back with a fresh outlook and an epiphany waiting for you. You'll definitely be happy about this nonlinearity, because this game, more than any other game, has the unique ability to make you think \"This level is literally impossible\". You don't just get the feeling that it's just very hard and you haven't found the solution yet, you literally think \"Yep, there's absolutely no way this can be done.\" You're always wrong, of course. The correct statement would probably be \"Yep, there's absolutely no way this can be done using the techniques I am aware of\". So you need a new technique, a new approach. And guess what: The new approach is always outside the box. Sometimes outside several boxes at once.The game is not unfair. The rules of the game are ridiculously simple. To solve the puzzles, you need to learn to understand them. For each word in the game, you need to understand two things: what the word means, and what the word doesn't mean. The game loves to mess with your preconceptions like that: for example if there's nothing on screen meaning \"LAVA IS HOT\", then lava isn't hot, no matter how intimidating it looks.If you're out of ideas on some level, try to think backwards. What needs to be where for YOU to WIN? What needs to happen to achieve that? Very often, the game wants you to plan ahead and build a certain setup, one you can't just find through trial and error, but one that becomes way more obvious when you think about what needs to have been done.Later on in the game, you'll notice that the game has secretly begun to build more boxes around you while you were playing it. It lulls you in, repeatedly shows you things you'll come to expect, acts like there is an underlying structure to things beyond just the written rules. And then... it just starts subverting your expectations, mercilessly, one by one, without even breaking any of its rules. It's absolutely magnificent to experience, and it's all your own fault for believing there are limits in the first place.The game has an unlimited undo feature, and it's the one feature you'll use most in the game. You will live the undo, breathe it. It is a good feature.Now get to it, buy this game.","Towards the mid game I would get repeatedly stumped and when I looked at the solutions I knew I never would have thought of them which led to me just feeling frustrated and kinda stupid. If you're good at thinking outside the box you will probably have a better time.  Also there are several guides that give hints without giving away the whole solution but the game had already worn me out by the time I found out about them.","Whoever made this will probably develop psychoactive powers and enslave humanity. 11\/10","Baba Is You is an extremely addictive and very challenging puzzle game that's nothing like any other game out there.

The word swapping mechanic to change how the level works is a fresh idea that works really well. It doesn't get old in the entire course of the game as a bunch of new mechanics are added in every major area. It lets you learn the mechanics well by always giving a level to introduce new mechanics, allowing you to experiment and figure out how it works.While the game does have a large amount of extremely difficult levels, it doesn't really go from easy to hard in its overall progression. Instead, each major area in the game has a mix of easy and hard levels, meaning that you can progress without having to beat every single level in an area. It also means that you can break from a certain puzzle without stopping the game entirely, by simply going to another level or area (at least you can after the first major area).I also don't feel there is any filler; The game demands your attention in order to solve all of the puzzles, and so almost of the time I've played has been proper playtime (almost as some of it was AFK). I haven't yet completed the game fully, and I'm already above 27 hours as of this review.

Its a new game from Arvi Hempuli Teikari. Its also is a game that scratches that particular itch of mine when I look for puzzle games. Its not just about the rules the game makes, but rather how you deal with them, change them, and make your own rules. This is Baba is You.GraphicsBaba is You is a simple puzzle game, there doesnt appear to be a story, and the graphics as youll see below are a bit plain, however, Baba is You does quite a bit with the simplistic graphics.The titular Baba is a sheep, perhaps. Admittedly, its not always clear what certain objects are, there are three major names that are confusing. Baba Keke and Me. Each refers to a different object that youll eventually recognize through repetition. While one can make guesses of what these objects are, such as sheep, cat, and human, it really doesnt really matter. As long as you know that Baba, is the vague white shape, you have the full knowledge that you need. Each word refers to the same object for the entire game, so theres no confusion with what each word refers to after the first encounter.Itll become clear once we dive into the gameplay, but the name of an object has no power. A Baba, is just an object, as is a wall, a tree, or a rock. As long as the names of objects are clear, Baba is You is able to work efficiently.Some of these names can be confusing but names and objects are presented at the same time, so while there might be some confusion on what a Fungus means, the fact that theres a mushroom on the level make it clear what the player is looking for.But to be honest, the graphics in Baba are serviceable, because they are not very important. Players should have something to look at, and be representative of iconography but the gameplay is where Baba is You exists, if youre coming to look at the game, its in service to that gameplay.Similarly, there is no story with Baba is You, at least nothing beyond Here are some puzzles. Similar to Stephens Sausage Roll, Baby is You doesnt require a story beyond that, this is a pure puzzle game, where even the names of the levels are very minor hints or jokes on the theme of a puzzle.GameplaySo what are the puzzles? Well, Baba is You is unique in that the rules of the game are on the screen at all times and they are the puzzle. If there are three words next to each other forming Baba is You, then the Baba object (the sheepish looking white blob that is in a number of the images) is considered the player.This creates an understanding of how rules work. When words form a sentence, thats considered a rule and usually is implemented immediately. Similarly, if those words are separated, they lose all effect. I say usually because sometimes rules can come into conflict with each other, but thats part of the learning process.Normally I dont refer to my pictures directly but this is a special case. In the screen above, you have four very specific rules.Baba is You The grammar is poor but necessary for the game. Everything is set up to be Object is action or Object. In this case, it simply means the white Baba is controllable. Next to that, we have Flag is Win and thats just telling us in order to beat the level, the flag must be touched. We also have Wall is Stop which means the wall is impenetrable. And finally Rock is Push which simply means rocks are pushable (And impenetrable).So from here, we have four rules. You control Baba, objects cant go through walls, rocks are pushable and touch the flag to win. This is a simple tutorial level where the player just has to push the rock out of the way to win.But thats not the only way. Each word is a pushable object so the player can move Is and Win over to make the Walls the win condition. Suddenly the Walls are the goal. Of course, if they make it so horizontal where Wall is Stop still exists, then both conditions are true. The player cant enter the wall, but the wall is the victory condition. A similar situation can happen with the rocks, as push operates somewhat similar to Stop in that the player cant enter the rock.But a quick push on either Is or Stop\/Push and suddenly those walls or rocks are enterable. The player can even get tricky and set up Baba is You and Baba is Win and instantly win, my personal favorite way of beating any level when possible.Theres only one danger on this level. If the player moves any of the words of Baba is You in such a way that nothing is You the level stalls. The music will die down, but essentially, the level ends, and the game tells you to undo or retry again. This might sound strange but from the gameplay its simple. If nothing is you then nothing is controllable and you cant change the scene.Of course with some work, the wall, the rock, or the flag can be you as well. The fact is each rule is malleable and the player has control to make what he wants happens, in fact, thats most of the players agency.The other levels on display here show more complex versions of the game and rules, and these are hardly the only rules in Baba is You. Baba is You is broken up into sections of the game, each with a number of levels, and each section seems to introduce something new, usually in the form of a new word to use. These words can be anything from a rather large list but some of them are Not, On and even Text itself. Each word has a purpose. There are a couple of words late in the game that are some of my favorites, but Ill hold off on sharing them here.Baba is You excels at its level design as almost every section starts rather easily teaching a word, and then grows incrementally more complex. This isnt done through increasing the number of moves but rather the thought process required. In fact, theres no dexterity required as the game only moves after the player makes a move, and most solutions become as simple as realizing the series of moves and then executing them relatively fast. The most complex puzzles probably only require a hundred steps at most, and most will take under 30 seconds to complete once the solution is known.Its the puzzles that allow Baba is You to excel. I found myself amazed at how many times Baba is You could deliver multiple different puzzles in a row using a similar collection of words, and yet each puzzle feels unique.Much of Baba is You though is staring at the puzzle and trying to understand all the elements and the process to succeed. Early on, theres usually more than one way to beat a puzzle, but eventually, puzzles require specific solutions. Though the game is very clever about them.If you want to read more and see a final score, you can see the full review with pictures and video athttps:\/\/kinglink-reviews.com\/2019\/05\/25\/baba-is-you-review\/.

There are no time constraints, and you can undo your moves as far back as you need to, so it's surprisingly relaxing for a game consisting entirely of seriously difficult, often terrifyingly complex logic puzzles.  It's so tightly designed that there isn't a single puzzle I managed to solve by accident, without understanding exactly how I did it, and there were many, many occasions where my totally brilliant, horribly complicated (but ultimately wrong) solution would have worked if only this one single piece of wall weren't there, or if this moving object were one square ahead or behind at a specific moment, making me acutely aware that the designer had anticipated my every move and planned accordingly.Less because of the nature of the puzzles (although there is some similarity there) and more because of the overall level of difficulty, branching map with themed puzzles, and artfully simple visuals, Baba Is You reminds me most of Andrew Plotkin's System's Twilight.  I have been carrying a torch for that game since the '90s, to the point that I have an emulator set up just to run it and the two other great Mac-exclusive games - so for me to consider a game in the same league as System's Twilight is really high praise.Baba Is You is better than System's Twilight.","Brain is melt","Brain HurtyMore Specifically it's a game about thinking outside the box, but even when you think outside of the box you have to think your way out of another box to get to that glorious flag, or wall that you made have that little win box","This game is very, very good.","Endlessly creative and surprisingly difficult puzzle game. My wife and I love to play this together.","Very mind-blowing puzzle game as you try every possible means to change the rules in each level for accomplishment. It can be frustrating sometimes (okay maybe more often), as is usually the case for puzzle games, but it won't stop you from enjoying the rest part of it. The game gets more and more abstract (or say meta) as one progresses, and there are always a lot to discover---surprise!As more mechanisms are introduced, their interactions can be rather complicated given that the basic rules are seemingly quite simple, but they can also appear very weird and have some underlying assumptions for the level to work. Personally I'm not very comfortable with these peculiarities, but that can be improved (if I were to develop). It does not affect the whole game experience nevertheless.","There is nothing wrong with this game. I am just stupid. I will never finish it.

(And there's a lot that use unexplained mechanics. Expecting you to just stumble upon them when trying every solution possible in a desperate attempt to finish it) It becomes nothing more than a frustrating mess where you'll look up solutions and instead of saying \"welp i'm dumb\" you'll just say \"how was i ever supposed to think of that?\" And this is the case for atleast half the levels so far and I'm only 2 hours in (no refund :( ) and i've heard it gets much harder lategame, that sounds like a nightmare.Good idea ruined by terrible execution - 1\/5(also my goodness the music is so obnoxiously repetitive)","Prepare for brain hurt.","Great premise, great execution.

I'll summarize my thoughts below:First off, the premise of this game is divine; the inspired concept of rule bending to solve an otherwise impossible puzzle is truly inspired and exceptionally unique. The first parts of the game were incredibly fun, finding weird and interesting ways to solve various levels was what made the game as fun and interesting as the reviews make it out to be.But once you cast aside the starting region; things begin to take a turn for the mundane. The fun rule bending concept is suddenly clamped to the form of a single solution to every puzzle and you find yourself no longer trying to think outside of the box; but rather being forced into a single viable solution with a set of steps that need to be followed to win.In the context of a pure puzzle game, this isn't strictly a bad thing; harder puzzles usually mean the solutions are more tightly wound. The problem is that the core tenant of this puzzle game is rule bending; and what makes rule bending fun is that you don't usually \/have\/ to adhere to any one singular solution to anything; being able to think outside the box to solve a level is what makes or breaks the concept as a whole and what ultimately makes it fun and engaging.Whats worse; is that what few examples of truly creative solutions that players have discovered for some of the later levels that allow them to ignore certain 'words' or 'phrases' is apparently unintentional enough to warrant developer action to make those solutions no longer viable; further cementing the idea that the game has taken the wrong approach for its concept; at least in my eyes.Ultimately, it winds up being an example of a really cool idea that completely fails to live up to its potential; but still results in some tricky and interesting puzzles, at the very least. I can still recommend it to anyone who likes a good puzzle or two.","There are not many single player games that I've played for more than 100 hours - it is one of them, and it is not a game made by some large company. The concept is really simple and each puzzle can be executed quickly even though some levels may take hours to understand the main trick. Special thanks for the the part beyond the main one in the game, this is awesome! Just when you thought that you understand how the game works, it sends you deeper and rules start to matter everywhere, you may even start to see them in your room, but I hope not. One of the best puzzle games I remember, for sure.Graphics, music, controls are simple, but I like the way these are done and overall style is pleasant. Though after some tough levels I had to turn off the music, some of it was hard to listen over and over, but, well, partially it is because of my slowiness.Thanks for the game!","GAME is GREATPUZZLE is HARDisFUNBRAIN is HURT and LARGE((If you love puzzle games, this is a must buy))","Very Creative Game","This is the best puzzle game of all time, and it's not close.","holy guacamole this game is hard","Baba is love.

Controlling Baba just feels awful, and there's little in the way of interactivity outside of pushing blocks.

So far seems a little less frustrating than SnakeBird (which I liked, but got pretty hard mid-way though). A little more logical than pure spatial like SB. Really enjoying the soundtrack.","Are these game designers such geniuses???","Amazing puzzle game with a large connection to debugging\/programming","An incredibly creative puzzle game, starts off simple but the puzzles really ramp up later on","Incredibly Fun Puzzle game definitely recommend it to any puzzle lovers","This very original puzzle game will melt your brain. It's simple premise could be described as Sokoban, for the block pushing mechanic, mixed with computer language scripting.You control Baba, a sheep living in a world were the very rules of the universe can be re-written. With you on the board are divers objects. Blocks that form the scenery on a black background, \"text\" that represent some of the backround objects, and conditions such as \"is\". With those text block and conditions you can form sentenses that define the properties of objects on the board. Indeed, \"Baba Is You\" is the very fundamental rule that allow the player to control Baba. Break that rule by pushing a block off alignment, and the little sheep will not respond to your inputs anymore. Do not worry however, mistakes do not mean death, as the game includes a very handy rewind option that allow to go back up to the very first step you took o n the board.With these basic principles, push text, changes the rules, move blocks, your goal to clear a board is to reach the flag. However, the clever player will find unusual way to clear a stage; in fact it is very much expected of you to think outside of the box to \"break\" the rules and be creative to solve a puzzle. The more advanced levels are absolutely devilish in difficulty and you might find yourself stuck and pulling hairs over seemingly unsolvable situation.The game becomes very hard very quick, but if you have the patience for it, it is the kind of brain teaser that will keep you entertained and ponder solutions for dozens of hours as you conquer more than  200 levels. A charming yet challenging experience with minimalist presentation, soothing music and heeps of content. To play on the go or in long binge sessions.","amazing puzzle game 9.5\/10","Stupid is you","A challenging puzzle-solving game with a unique mechanic.If you are willing to stew over puzzles for days, or recreate whole maps on paper, then this is the game for you.If you want something with a bit more fast-paced action, or an in-depth storyline, then it probably isn't the game for you.","The best puzzle game I've ever played.","YOU IS WIN","I'll keep my review simple. I finished like 50 levels and then I developed a new routine in my life. I have to finish a new Baba is you level every day. That way I keep my brain working. This is a great puzzle game.","Steam made me write a review for points. Blame them for this and ignore my post.","Review is Positive","Baba is Good","Looks silly and innocent, but holy hell is it a brain twister...","This game makes me feel like I don't have enough IQ to solve any of its puzzles but it's still really funplay it","One of the best games I've ever played that helped me get into the puzzle game genre. It has very simple controls, graphics, and fundamentals. In the beginning, you'll learn the basic mechanics and breeze through the first two worlds. Easy to learn but hard to master is what's most accurate. As with most puzzle games, it's best to go in blind, but I'll explain the basics. I'd like to note that I haven't 100% completed the game (yet), but I have beat the game.Controls-Movement is purely wasd\/arrow keys. It's all tile based and top down.-The undo button is your friend! Give Z a push as many times as you want.-Quick and easy resets with R.-The only other key you will use is space to \"wait\" later on.The World Map-You do not need complete every level in a world to move on, so you can easily switch between levels if you get stuck (which WILL happen). -A certain number of dandelion puffs (?) are required to complete a world. You get one per level. Completing a world will earn you a flower and will unlock 0-2 new worlds. (Note: Completing a world does NOT mean 100% of the world is completed.)Gameplay-Basically, you make the rules of the game by forming sentences with individual words. (Remember syntax!)-Move, push objects, push yourself?-Repeat with a multitude of variations.Graphics-Very simple pixel graphics.-There's a toggle for some settings. Personally, I turn off the constant wobble effect, enable grid, and force high-contrast colors (makes some worlds look way less gross imo).-Character design is cute.-Objects are easily recognizable symbols and get to the point.MusicVery simple, like the graphics. A majority of the time I played with music off and listened to my own stuff in the background. However, this does not mean that the music is bad. It's really relaxing and reminds me of a retro game\/lo-fi(?). The whole soundtrack is available on Youtube if you want to check it out https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=X98pchrBVu0&list=PLMoZgWjm14OF2AWFfPc3cyQH7T2SC89jo. There's only one track per world, so I could see the music becoming repetitive if you kept it on the whole time.Difficulty-Levels range from extremely easy (usually the levels introducing a new mechanic\/word) to extremely hard (usually the extra levels\/ later worlds).-The levels never seem unfair. After you complete a level you were having difficulty with, you'll end up saying, \"How did I not figure that out? That was actually so simple!\" or \"WHAT? I'M SO STUPID!!!\" A LOT. -It feels amazing when you don't look up a guide or hints (this guide is great if you need it btw https:\/\/www.keyofw.com\/baba-is-hint\/overworld). The wait until you figure it out yourself is worth it, so please don't do yourself a disservice and look up exact solutions.ConclusionOverall, don't play this game if you don't want a challenge, but if you like puzzle games\/want to get into puzzle games, then this a fun way to spend your time. Most importantly, the game is exactly what it looks like (with a few fun surprises that I don't want to spoil), so if it looks fun, then you get what you pay for.","This game is really innovative with its ability to change the rules. Just be prepared to suffer - these puzzles are very challenging and require a lot of outside the box thinking. And that's why I like this game so much.","Solid and mind-bending puzzler.","Very fun and unique","Game is good","BABA IS GREATISME IS NOT BOREDANDHARD","It's a very good game.-The art style is nice to look at.-The puzzles are fun to solve, but incredibly difficult (it feels like trying to understand quantum mechanics, not very easy to say the least).-it has quite a large amount of levels and with the difficulty of solving them, you'll be spending quite a few hours if you wanna beat game 100%.-the way the levels are organized by themes makes solving the puzzles less frustrating, as concepts are \"explained\" it prior puzzles.so yeah, tis good game, give it a 8.5\/10 (the soundtrack is kinda annoying and makes it hard to think so i'm dunking a point).","Mind bending fun!","Great brain teaser if you are looking for something like that.

The premise is easy enough - you move words around to make sentences that change the rules of the level. The levels themselves are endlessly complex. 20 hours and I'm nowhere near completing it, even after finding the secret area. Finding the solution to each puzzle is a joy and trying to work out the intricate machinations of the cute little Baba is an amazing experience. It is perhaps marred by some really bizzare and unintuitive solutions, particularly those involving moving two words onto each other, but it is still a fantastic game you should try.","I'm on like area 3 and this game stumps me on just about every other level.

It perfectly nails that mindbending aspect of good puzzle games without being too showstoppingly hard, and there's a real sense of accomplishment on the completion of a level. Like the Portal games, there's a very specific way of thinking needed to progress, with new elements being presented along the way. There's also something to be said about the quality of a game that requires no real hand-holdy tutorial.The visuals are charming and reinforce the notion that good concepts are much more important to puzzle games than compelling graphics. The music is simple without being too annoying and repetitive.I'd say that this is an excellent game for puzzle game novices and experienced players alike.

It grows, and changes it up without mixing it too much.Instead of fitting the same solutions into new levels, it changes how it thinks.When you are thinking about the sentences in one minute, you start thinking about the movement in the other. Then in another level it introduces something completely new.When you think you might be breaking the game, the game actually wants you to break it more.

It starts off quite easy and many of the puzzles offer various ways to solve them, but you also quickly get access to some real headscratchers in the optional levels, which were more tightly designed. The box can be pretty loose sometimes, since there is usually a need to modify the level itself to solve it, so the solutions can feel creative even while they stay inside the limits intended by the puzzle designer. The puzzles (at least in the early parts) are mostly built around one or a max of two tricks, and the necessary elements are mixed into the scenery. Some of the control mechanics for other entities in the levels kind of resembled puzzles from the Adventures of Lolo, back from who knows how long ago. All in all it's a very comfortable game that offers enough challenge to last for a while. An easy recommendation for anyone who enjoys puzzle games.","10\/10 really hard levels.

This is one of the most difficult puzzle games I have ever encountered, which makes it all the more rewarding when I successfully complete a level. I am not ashamed to admit I have used a guide a few times for puzzles I have been stuck on for days, but it is just that challenging. It has nothing to do with the faults of the design, but rather it is an inevitability of having a game play system as deep as this one. I found that some sections of the game spike in difficulty, where some worlds offer harder\/easier levels than others, but that could entirely be dependent on who is playing.Overall, this is a wonderful puzzle game that is packed charm, and I recommend it for those who enjoy good thought-provoking puzzles.","Baba is Finnish.","Good puzzle game","pretty interesting and hard VERY hard puzzle game,but its very enjoyabel","Simple, brilliant idea executed perfectly.One of the best puzzle games without doubt.","good","Great puzzle game with an interesting concept","BABA IS GOOD","Game is Good","Fun little puzzle game","Quick version: Buy it if you like puzzle games, try the free Game Jam version if you're on the fence.This quickly goes from standard box pusher in the first puzzle to a completely original type of puzzle game. The sheer number of puzzles the solo developer has made out of this one concept is amazing. The general game design is great as well; there are difficult bonus levels that will make you feel like a genius if you get them right on the first attempt, but later main levels will teach you what you need to do if you feel like going back. Another plus is that you don't have to beat every main level in an area to unlock the next one, with each area having a mechanic it revolves around. So if there's one you struggle with, do all the easy levels and move on to something else for a bit. You won't be put in that frustrating situation where you can't figure out one puzzle so everything else after it is locked away from you.At this point I still have a long way to go, but already feel I got my moneys worth, especially with the sale on.","Baba is Rabbit is Cheating is Fun","BA    IS    YOUBAISGOOD","A great mind-bending puzzle game.

Fantastic game and concept.","simple design but the puzzles are great","Very fresh and unique take on a puzzle game. Essentially, instead of trying to complete puzzles with defined rules, the puzzle lies in how you can manipulate and change rules to reach a win condition.There's tons of content, and you can very easily pick it up and put it down, either doing several puzzles a day or a puzzle every couple of days. The art style is cute and simple, making it easy to look at and process. The music is nice, but can get repetitive after a while spent in the same area.I think people with experience in programming will have an easy adapting to the kind of problem-solving you have to do, but others may find it harder to wrap their head around some of the puzzles. That said, when you finally figure out a solution, you mind will be blown and you'll feel like the smartest person in the world.So, all in all, I highly recommend this game. Check it out!","WOW.  I never thought a game could make me feel so dumb so quickly.  But in all seriousness, this game is amazing.","Super simple concept, super fun game.

After a bit of watching the stream, i decided to purchase it pretty much on a whim. This is one of the greatest puzzle games i've ever played, right up there with the portal games. The unique premise of changing the rules to work in your favor is worth the asking price alone, let alone the genius behind the puzzles and how much content there is in the game.

I will post a full review soon, but here are my initial thoughts.Baba is You is game about getting your character to the objective. Your character, the objective and objects on the screen all have characteristics that are based on words that are also on the screen. You can manipulate these words to change things - such as the objective. The objective might be a flag, but you could potentially switch the word flag for tree and then go to a tree next to you to beat the level. It gets complicated because of barriers and object positioning. You cannot always move things if they are in a corner for instance. This game makes you think and is very different from most games I have played. I would definitely encourage people to check it out if they are looking for a challenge.","Great small puzzle game based on logic and spacial awareness. No coding is required, it breaks it down into caveman speak (Baba is you, Water is hot, Box have key). It's quite challenging mainly because of the spacial aspect of the puzzles. It can also be tricky when the game introduces more elements where certain objects do not collide with each other, but I think the majority of the challenge is around manipulating the logic structures in the right space.","Great puzzle game! I love it","Baba is you. you is confused. confused is always. me is like.","Most difficult puzzle game I have ever played.","Very creative puzzles, would highly recommend","A very difficult game but the complete puzzle gives a lot of satisfaction.On the minus, I have to admit that not all rules are obvious - it probably requires abstract thinking, which is have not enough.One of my top 10 games.","Good puzzles, very original.","A refreshing take on a puzzle game.","A frustrating and brilliant game to play.

Basically, the rules are defined with short statements X IS Y (it gets more complicated, but this is the very basic idea), and you can then change the parameters of the level completely: How do walls behave, What can kill you, How do you win, What are you?I'll give one example that put a smile on my face. The flag was defined as the goal, but was seemingly out of reach, so I made my character the walls, then moved all walls simultaneously, and when one of the walls touched the flag, I won.","GAME IS GOOD AND SUBSCRIBENSTEIN IS DUMB","What the  am I playing?","baba   isbrilliant","yeetus","This game is amazing, great \"casual\" style puzzles but very difficult.","One of the best puzzle games 10\/10","Amazing game, really creative, most fun I've had with a puzzle game in a while.

I finished the game with 100% completion in ~35 hours the first time through, though your mileage may vary (expect anywhere from 20 to 60 hours to finish the entire game) - note that I replayed through the whole game several times, though obviously repeat playthroughs don't add anything new to the levels, only a knowledge of the solutions and quicker progressin short: 200+ puzzle levels with a cute pixel art style; difficulty ranges from trivial in the \"tutorial\" levels to moderate-hard in later areas; stresses an awareness of the game's rules at all times and an open mind; overall a substantial amount of content for the price and definitely worth playing if you enjoy games in this genre","Extremely fun and hard puzzle game. Sooo clever. My brain broke multiple times.","A refreshing take on the puzzle genre, highly recommended!","Rose Is RedViolet Is BlueBrain Is DeadBaba Is You","I really can't say enough great things about this game. You might be turned off if you're not a fan of the minimalistic art style (which reminds of games like Minit or Undertale), but if that's the case you're likely not to care much about puzzle games anyway. If you do like puzzle games and are itching for one with a clever, original idea, this is it.Simple put, every stage of this game comes with a set of rules defining attributes for objects and the environment around you (such as walls stopping you from moving or rocks being pushable or even what character you play as). In order to beat each stage, you have to manipulate those rules. Rules for every stage are written in text boxes that can be pushed around to turn off or enforce new rules that completely change how the environment works.Sometimes puzzles are entirely different from the ones that came before. Other times there's one minimal change that nevertheless forces you to come up with an entirely new solution. Sometimes the solution will be easy to quickly figure out. Other times you will be stumped for quite a while trying to solve what looks like an insurmountable obstacle.The really good thing about this is that due to the nature of the game design no puzzle feels unfair. Whenever you finally realize the solution you get a satisfactory \"A-ha!\" feeling rather than a frustrating \"How was I supposed to have thought of that?\" moment, so even when a puzzle gets head-bashingly hard you still a sense of satisfaction once you complete it.Still, there are a couple of anti-frustration features, like the fact that you don't need to complete all puzzles in succession, as some of them can be played in any order, and you don't need to complete every puzzle of every level in order to advance to the next one.As it is, though, you'll likely want to complete all puzzles anyway just because it's so much fun to do so. The fact that the game is designed to make its puzzles organically follow an established set of rules not only makes the game hard but fair, but you never feel the sensation of poor design you get in other games when you stumble on a solution the developer didn't think of and find out it doesn't work. Here, if a solution is correct, it'll always work, which rewards creativity.I could spend a good more time singing this game's praises, but I'll make it short: buy it, play it, have fun.","goty","I consider myself a good puzzle solver, but this game broke me.Nevertheless, each puzzle are very clever and satifying to solve","ROSES ARE REDVIOLETS ARE BLUEFLAG IS THE WINI'M IN LOVE WITH BABA IS YOU","This game feels like it should be super easy as every level can be solved under a minute... but you get stuck and it makes you feel awfully humiliated when you finally find out how simple was the solution...

Being open minded is the key and, through that aspect, it is very relaxing. My only real complaint is that I have not figured out a way to back out of a level without closing the game entirely and when I still want to play but get stuck on several levels in a row all of that rebooting of the game can be annoying.

While its central mechanic may be easy to understand initially, it very quickly becomes devilishly difficult and makes for some incredible brain teasers.

Extremely fun and interesting. While there are a few dud levels (like maybe 5-10), considering the game has ~225 levels that is to be expected. Since almost everything about the game is perfect, there isn't much to say except the negatives.The biggest flaw of the game is two fold:1.) The timing of some interactions is confusing and some of the \"puzzle gimmicks\" are a bit obtuse such that you'd never really get it without trial and error. This is not that major of an issue though.2.) The bigger issue is the structuring and difficulty of the levels. They jump all over the place and are seemingly organized by a few keywords, thematic ties, and gimmicks. However, that will sometimes have you trying to complete levels that you don't have enough background knowledge gained from earlier puzzles to solve. This can be extremely frustrating when another level teaches you a certain mechanism that might be required for other levels. Without a true level structure you can be ill prepared for other levels simply by not doing them in the \"proper\" order.Besides those issues, the game is pretty much flawless. Once it gets a map editor and a few polishes it will be one of the best puzzle games of all time. Solid 9\/10.",".","I may not have played this much, but i can tell you with confidence that this is the best puzzle game i've ever played, and might be the best one i've seen yet. If you think you'll be interested at all, its worth it, trust yourself.","If you like to stare at the screen and think about whether Baba should truly be You (spoilers: it doesn't always need to be), this is a game for you.The idea is very innovative and it actively breaks the rules imposed by common sense, such as that a wall does not necessarily have to stop you, or that reaching the flag is not always the way to win (e.g. you can make something else the winning condition, or make the flag be you). Once you boot this up, you'll start feeling the smell of burning brains and sounds of grinding gears in no time.As with many puzzle games, you'll sometimes be sitting staring at the screen for a few minutes, but finding the solution is very rewarding. (And do me a favour, don't spoil the solutions you know for others if you let them play it.)In my opinion, being a programmer also makes it easier because we sometimes have to think outside the box too (or strictly with defined rules only).This is also a very lightweight and small game (~115 MB only!) and it loads up immediately, so you can play it on literally any PC or laptop that runs Steam.","Brain Is Smart","gets too difficult after a while for me","Roses are RedViolets are BlueFlag is WinBaba is You","Absolutely stunning, Baba Is You is quite possibly the best puzzle game I've ever played. The game gives you words that dictate game rules, and you determine a way to solve the level using rules you create. Wall in between you and the goal? just  become the wall  and walk into the goal. And that's just a simple example. There are a number of very complex puzzles that give you incredible satisfaction when you realize the solution, you feel clever when you find a roundabout way to get to the goal besides the \"intended\" solution. As the game progresses you oftentimes have little or no opportunities for solutions other than the intended method, but even so it doesn't feel like you're being led down a pre-determined path, as every step of the way requires thought and experimentation. If you have trouble with some levels, they are able to be skipped, and aren't required to complete the world. While I think I'm pretty experienced with puzzle games, I don't think there are too many levels that are too difficult assuming you're willing to spend a bit of time thinking and trying out stuff. Baba Is You provides a unique experience and executes it's premise in a perfect way. the game is very intuitive but still houses many interesting mechanics and interactions that allow you to keep learning how the game works. It's difficult to replay many puzzle games due to knowing most of the solutions beforehand, but even in that scenario, you can still impose a challenge on yourself to find an alternate solution, which adds a good bit of replay value to the game, not to mention there are over 60 unique levels, with many bonus levels that are just more difficult versions of other levels.

Cons: You'll have to fight the urge to look up the solutions to harder puzzles. like how the frick do i complete half of these, those are impossible.I'm sure it only gets better from here.","My brain likes it, I think.","A puzzle game with a clever concept inspired by coding and simple cute graphics.","The game offers a  seemingly simple concept of a logical puzzle, but boy it can get complicated. Definitely worth playing if you're not afraid to struggle with multi-layered problem solving.","Game of the Year, and easily the best sokoban game I've played. Baba is You explores all of its gimmicks incredibly well, and seemingly has an endless supply of them up its sleeve. It also understands how to properly challenge the player. Some levels focus on an \"Aha\" moment, 1 fresh idea or move that's required to solve the puzzle. While others may simply be fun, asking the player to come up with their own creative solution to the problem presented. And it rewards creativity constantly. Many levels allow for multiple solutions, and if they don't then that's usually because the lesson being taught it important for future content. Finally it'll only require you to complete a handful of puzzles before unlocking the next area, and because areas tend to offer branching paths this opens up the game to a variety of players. Whether you'd prefer to fully complete each area before moving on to the next, or skip around exploring the easier gimmick introductions, Baba supports it.TL;DR - If you enjoy puzzle games, you'll fall in love with this.","Hard and I hate it. Very fun.","This has to be one of the best puzzle games I've played.After you play it, you begin talking in the terms of the game, imagining what the rules would look like for the real life scenarios you find yourself in. You repeat back to yourself the clever rules you wove in the levels that initially had you stumped but made you feel like a complete genius for solving.That's what you want in a puzzle game, something that seems impossible at first but opens up its solution when you give it a real good think and rewards you with the feeling that you are essentially Einstein.Yet all you did was make \"BABA IS WIN\"","I LOVED this game. I actually 100%ed it.It's definitely a good buy if you like things that are meta and unique.","Rose is RedViolet is BlueFlag is Win   (Usually)Baba is You","this game is incredible. if you like stephens sausage roll, the witness, or any \"coding\" style game you need to get it.","reallll illlll","A very creative and original puzzle game, which has great fun playing with classic genre tropes. Each world introduces new keywords which all lend themselves to creative lateral thinking puzzles. Every mechanic is (literally) self-explanatory. You have the ability to undo any number of moves so you'll never have to repeat everything due to a mistake.I should also mention that the *content* of the puzzles is also entertaining and varied. Each level paints its own story in its setup+solution. Some of my favorites so far include a poem that you have to scramble into your solution, one where you need a \"friendly\" ghost to push you down a hallway, one where you need to stop being the main character long enough to get pushed across some deadly terrain and then somehow regain control, and one where you have to alternatingly throw yourself and your name into water until you can make a sentence that turns you invincible.","Baba is good","Best puzzle game I've played in a long time.Huge variety of levels covering a wide skill range, ramping up in difficulty as you progress.Cute aesthetic, music provides a good background for solving problems.Baba Is You?Baba Is Best.","Ever wanted to play a puzzle game dedicated to thinking outside the box?In this game, you are the box, the inside of the box, the outside of the box, and the 6 dimensions above our dimensions.

You complete levels by messing around with these logic rules until you can create a win condition, e.g. \"[Flag] [Is] [Win]\".  As you may imagine, increasing the number of words and connectors exponentially explodes the number of possibilities you can create, so you have to be clever and act with a goal in mind rather than trying things randomly.The difficulty ceiling in this game is astronomical, to the point where I've spent hours on some puzzles and still not cleared them.  However, there's hundreds of others to choose from and the game includes many quality of life features like \"undo\" and \"restart\" buttons which are very quick and easy to use.  It's also pretty good about making the hardest puzzles not be roadblocks so you can make a lot of progression even if you struggle on the hardest parts of a world.Baba is You is a puzzle game straight up with nothing getting in the way or slowing you down.  At least several hours of fun for an average player and dozens more for those willing to struggle to uncover and leverage the game's more bizarre and complex logic.","Awesome game.

The game encourages you trying to \"break\" the levels, often with hilarious results. \"Baba is you\" is a perfect example of what a good puzzle game should be.I should also mention that the game is hard, some of the levels took me more than half a hour to find the solution, and I haven't entirely finished the game yet.

And this is no exaggeration. This game is everything it claimed to be and even more. I had only one fear when purchasing the game, and it was that the game might be too short (only a few worlds with ~10 levels each). I was pleasantly surprised to see that the game is infact, really really long. So I want to go a bit more in depth. This game is based on a really unique aspect, and that is that you control what things do inside a level. Normal rules on any other 2D puzzle game would be that wall stops you and flag is win. In this game though, wall can be you and flag can be stop. This mechanic that the game is based on is simply genius, and having had a lot of experience with 2D puzzle games in the past, I can safely say that it's extremely unique and original. Another amazing thing about this game is how there are new mechanics being constantly introduced. Thatmakes all the levels unique and fresh, even the bonus levels ,which are slight alterations of others. If I could find a drawback in this game, it is that it is a really difficult game. It needs consentration and patience to play it. That is a great advantage at the same time though, because if the player is in the mood to play this game, it will definately be a great time. I feel like 6 hours of gametime barely scratch the surfice of this game, and having seen other reviews, I think it is true, this game just keeps on getting betterClosing thoughts: Baba Is You is the best modern puzzle game I have ever played.

You play as the titular BABA (a white, dog-like creature) and try to reach the flag to win the level. to do so you can play around with some objects properties by moving words around, so while a wall stops your progress look for the word group [WALL] [IS] [STOP] and break it up. and suddently you can go through walls.the game starts up with simple puzzles to get the mechanics down but after a few stages the levels become deviously head-scratching. and oftentimes a strategy that worked in 4-5 will spell disaster in 4-6. the game thrives on you having to work and trick mechanics by using the IS YOU or IS WIN commandsthe graphics look lovingly hand drawn and the music is pleasing.

This difficulty soon ramps up though, and it wasn't long before I was skipping levels with the intention of solving them later when my brain had a few days to reset itself.While the difficulty can jump around quite significantly at times, a lot of this is due to its nature as a puzzle game. There are certainly a few later levels that were much easier than ones that came before, and asides from the occasional solution that feels a little \"unfair\" or \"unintended\", the vast vast majority of them are excellently done.I don't wish to spoil the much later levels, but boy when you think you've finished there are still secrets to be found, in some of the most unique and bizarre ways I have ever experienced.Also Baba is Cute.","Incredibly creative puzzle game, love it!","Brilliant little puzzle game with some really fun and clever mechanics.

Really shows how to create a full-fledged game based on single good game play mechanic.","Brain Is Melt","i gained 100 iq by playing it until the 3rd area then my brain shut down","I'm honestly shocked that I didn't like this game. tl;dr Baba Is You is an awesome logic puzzle game that, roughly every other level past the first world, makes you do your taxes before you can continue playing, and if you make a single mistake and don't immediately catch it you have to start over.The game punishes you - severely - for not being a chess computer that plans 25 moves ahead before taking a single step.Basically, there's two puzzle games going on in any Baba level - the one where you figure out what objects you need to carry across the level to get the right ___ IS ___ AND ___ sentences set up, turning the rules on and off and moving things in to the right position to take advantage of the changing rules... and the incredibly tedious Sokoban-esque tile shuffling required to get the pieces in to the places they need to be in order to demonstrate to the game that you've solved the fun puzzle. I know exactly what I have to do, but every time I try to move my pieces in to place I end up accidentally pushing something in to a corner or behind something else so I have to undo several steps back to try again - or I realize I accidentally moved something one tile too far to the left twenty five steps ago and I have to re-solve two thirds of a puzzle I've already solved because I subtly painted myself in to a corner.You can think of it as a good game with bad controls - it's very difficult to predict what effect your control inputs on the individual block and tile scale will have on the whole-level scale, and in the levels that are meant to be a challenge rather than a tutorial your actions will usually just screw yourself over.","Great Game!","Baba Is You and good and me is dumb.Baba Is You and is a Sokoban-type puzzle game about manipulating rules, made by Hempuli, who had previously made the lesser known (and underrated) Environmental Station Alpha. Baba is quite a departure from that game in terms of genre and atmosphere, though for those familiar with the second half of ESA you would have recognised his fondness for puzzles. It's also much more light-hearted and quirky than ESA - everything has this derpy look and wobbly effect that makes the game look surprisingly cute (and Baba may be my favourite abstracted animal-type creature in recent memory). The music also has a mellow, lo-fi sound that eases the potential frustration of puzzle-solving.The best thing about Baba is that Baba is you, but also that 'thinking outside the box' is an ideology that's central to this game. The game is literally about making and breaking your own rules: a skull could mean defeat or it could also be you; a wall might be something that impedes movement or is what wins you the level (or is you). Gradually new keywords and mechanics get introduced as you unlock new zones until it feels like there's an entire logical grammar based on them, and the game utilises them very well in its puzzles. A solution rarely feels the same for any two puzzles, and little time is spent tutorialising new mechanics with filler puzzles. Some keywords are particularly amusing to play around with (the Chasm zone is a personal highlight), and some levels have some especially mindblowing solutions (e.g. The Floatiest Platforms, and a certain Scenic Pond level). A small issue is that a few keywords did not feel like they were explored to their fullest extent (e.g. directional keywords, Facing, More), although the promise of a level editor would alleviate that somewhat.Baba is not an easy game to complete - I'd put it as harder than The Witness, and while the puzzles are more bite-sized than Stephen's Sausage Roll's some of them are on the same or even higher level of difficulty. There are many 'extra' levels that are both genius and diabolical in their design, iterating upon a previously existing level but with a few subtle changes that make it far more difficult. Even in the first world there may be levels that are that remain unsolved until you suddenly have an 'eureka' moment five worlds later. The beauty of this game though is that even those who rarely play puzzle games can experience most of the overworld due to the leniency of the area completion threshold, the freedom to choose multiple different levels at almost any point and the accessibility of the introductory levels in each world.Puzzle solving in Baba is inherently based on experimentation - it's nearly impossible to visualise a solution simply by starting at the initial state of the level. There's potential to feel as though you stumbled across a solution by pure chance, but the level design manages to steer away from that fairly well - every element in a level usually has some reason behind its inclusion. Deductions are often a case of 'what if these keywords could be arranged this way', or 'is it possible to manipulate the level into a specific state'. That said, there were some puzzles that felt far too open or unintuitive as to where to start, and a few that focused on a niche application of a keyword without easing the player in first. The developer has been open to suggestions though, and since I started playing the game certain behaviours have been made more noticeable, and several levels have been designed to be more intuitive to approach while maintaining the same solution concept.There's a wonderful sense of discovery in Baba: seeing what a keyword does for the first time, or wondering what new keywords might appear in the next zone, or simply how many levels there are. For those who have finished ESA you may be expecting some sort of twist in the middle of the game; I certainly was. To my delight, this indeed does happen in the form of a keyword called Level, where the level itself can now be manipulated and turned into objects. The rules at the bottom right of the overworld suddenly have a purpose, and 'winning' the overworld rewards you with yet another world one layer above it. This moment of discovery happens multiple times, where gradually the rigid concepts of the game begin to unravel themselves. Everything appears to be fair game now: letters that constitute keywords take up their own individual spaces, the level select maps themselves become large meta-puzzles that require the manipulation of its sub-levels to complete, and even the cursor that selects the levels themselves may be transformed. The true ending that is unlocked after traversing the final world (coincidentally titled Meta) caps the game off wonderfully, starkly contrasting the happy earlier one with a spoonful of existential dread. It's true to the style of ESA - once again I wish the game had gone even deeper with that aspect, though understandably enough this isn't much of a game for story.To put it succinctly, Baba is one of the best games that's come out this year. It has an extremely novel concept that is developed thoroughly, with a satisfying amount of content that feels rewarding to complete. I spent about 35 hours focused on completing the game, with extra time revisiting levels and trying out the early version of custom level functionality. This seems to be on the low end though, and your time will greatly vary depending on how quickly you pick up on the mechanics and levels. Even at full price the game is absolutely worth it, and with an official level editor and new mechanics on the horizon my wholehearted recommendation can only get better."],["GameIsBuy","Very likely the best puzzle game ever made. Brilliant.I am in the later stages and have been continually impressed by how the game reinvents itself every few levels. It is customary to attempt a level for the first time and think it is impossible. Then there's an \"aha\" moment, maybe more than one, and it's on to the next thing. Sometimes this takes minutes and sometimes hours so the puzzles are nicely balanced.The game I am reminded of most is Super Meat Boy, although they are in completely different genres. They have a similar success in distilling the best and avoiding the worst of similar games. Baba Is You also has a similar overarching structure as a platformer. Many puzzle games suffer from an overarching flatness of game experience, meaning the last levels are quite similar in difficulty to the first. Here there is quite a bit to differentiate each \"world\" that is centered around a new set of mechanics. As with Super Meat Boy, most players will reach a point where they have to buckle down and spend many hours per level. This high difficulty ceiling is wonderful for a puzzle game as the genre by nature lacks replayability.The aesthetic emphasizes functionality above all but still manages to be cute and easy on the eyes. Overall there is a sense that nothing is wasted. No spoilers but there are some pleasant surprises as well. If you are a fan of puzzle games then you will get what you want here and you will get it in spades.An essential puzzle game.","      ,       .","Just spent 51 hours of game for 100% completion.

A puzzle game where you need to stumble upon the solution is not a puzzle game.  (This is my revised review of the game after giving it a second chance. The rest of the review below is my first review, it still stands)The game mechanic of changing the rules seems genius at first, but it'a actually just a novelty. It will slowly become a generic sokoban game. Slow enough for you to play it for more than 2 hours and unable to refund it. I wish i could've refunded mine.Later puzzles has a lot of \"restricted rules\"; rules you can't change because they're boxed in or at the very edge of the puzzle. Puzzles usually only have one solution so again, a generic sokoban game. By watching the trailer I thought I could be wild with my imagination and break the rules, nope, \"restricted rules\" stops you from doing that.Introduction of new \"tiles\" are unintuitive and inconsistent. Some solutions may actually feel \"gliltchy\"; kinda like \"wait, you could do that?\". With the game mechanincs that's understandable, you break the rules in the first place. I remember one puzzle that made me say \"that's impossible\". It was too simple looking and there was not much to move. But the solution actually requires you to overlap with the text, which feels glitchy. That game never teaches you the new tiles and the byproducts of breaking the rules. You're basically left on your own to see what stick and what doesn't. Some rules can't be overridden too.I can understand some might find the game frustrating to the point of just googling the solutions. And a puzzle game where you need to google solutions is no fun. I'm capable enough to not experience that, but I agree it can be frustrating. This is not a game that you can binge play, you're gonna need to take breaks. The game also requires you to be more creative and experimental more than logical and orderly, I'm not sure if that is a good thing or a bad thing. If you have a 300 IQ and is creative genius maybe you could get something out of this game, but really it's just unintuitive, inconsistent, frustrating, tedious, and generic. The novelty of the game mechanic will wear off. And with 200+ puzzles it will be a drag sooner rather than later.","Baba Is Great","I'm not smart enough to understand this game","Challenging and rewarding puzzle game.

I've only had that feeling once in this game so far, and that's after about 50 puzzles. The vast majority of the time, the rules make sense, the resources you have available to you are clear, and you can see where a puzzle is going well enough to not get too frustrated while mulling it over. It's easy on the eyes with clean, cute graphics, and the movement is snappy with fun sound effects. Everything comes together to make a really immersive experience with what seems to be an insane amount of quality content for the price. Would definitely recommend to anyone who likes the thoughtful side of zoning out.","Solid puzzle game that does things differently than most.","A fun puzzle game, where the rules of the world are made of objects in the world - and can thus be manipulated.

Baba is a really special game, the concept was pretty unique since it was announced for the first time, the main concept of this game is \"you don't play under the rules, you make the rules\" and that's awesome, there are tons and tons of different ways to play the game, and that's what makes Baba something special. The game is literally a playground for you to test with different combinations, just a few are correct but not because of that you should not experiment with the options, A door can be the key, a Wall can be Baba, A tree can be water, almost everything is possible with the right word combination and that's just awesome and the puzzles are not something that easy to get, some are really well thought and a bit tricky. Visually is really simple but effective, it's a pretty standard pixel-art with a a great OST at the background, nothing too laud but something more soft which is great. There are a lot of levels and content waiting for you to play with, it's an amazing game, something really different and unique and deserves to be explored, really recommend this game to everyone, it's a puzzle adventure that makes you consider all the possibilities when it comes to make the rules work, tbh, if you like puzzles even just a bit you can't go wrong with this one.Hope you all enjoy it because it's amazing.","Game is simple and challenging.Great game","baba is good and pure","This game was challenging to keep me puzzling for hours.Minimalist art enhances the setting and allows you to work on the most critical elements.Great experience to see my friends solve some levels in completely different and novel ways that I didn't think about!","very nice reflexion game","This game has a pretty enjoyable puzzle aspect that is fun to experiment with to see what you can do. Some of the puzzles can be frustrating when you can't figure them out, but the reward when you do figure it out is always great.

Arvi Hempuli Tekari is an insanely talented game developer whos previously released Environmental Station Alpha (a metroidvania) and is currently working on Noita (a magical action rogue-lite), and in between these two we have this gem.Its an incredibly compelling mix of Sokoban and pseudo-programming, for lack of a better term. The ingenuity of the game lies in the number of ways that you can rewrite the levels rules by pushing around the text blocks. There are typically a few fixed rules that are shoved into a corner or wall and thus remain true for the whole level, but they are often allowed to be interacted with in other manners (and especially, in the case of one puzzle, you have to somehow find a way to break up a fixed rule). In spite of the fixed rules, you still have a fair amount of freedom with the blocks you are already given - such that finding the correct solution feels occasionally like finding a needle in a haystack!But when you DO eventually get the puzzle solution though, you usually get overwhelmed with at least one of two emotions - 1) feeling like a genius for solving a tricky puzzle, and\/or maybe 2) stupidity or shame, for not immediately seeing the solution, or for overthinking it massively. At least, thats how I usually personally felt, and frankly its a wonderful thing. And I am honestly looking forward to experiencing these emotions the more I play the game, as I get up to grips with the new text blocks that get nicely and gradually introduced. This game might look and sound deceptively cute (the sprites are terrific and I have the main menu theme and the lake theme playing on repeat in my head), but its very well one of the best puzzle games released this year.When to buyHours worth of puzzling goodness abound. Highest discount is 30%, but if you have a knack for solving puzzles you'll likely sink enough hours into it to offset the cost even if you pay full price. (Not that that's a bad thing.) 9.5\/10"],["excellent, very challenging puzzle game!","Cool idea that is never used.For some reason the main mechanic changes in later levels from the unique idea of changing game mechanics into \"flag is win, you can't change it or anything else in this level. Just figure the movement required to get to the flag\".There's a level where you need to directly calculate the amount of steps required so that you can touch a button with a crate. There's no thinking required, just math. There's another level where you just push text for 10 minutes straight. I checked the solution online, it's the same, long and easy task that I was doing. There's levels where you never touch text, meaning you cannot change the game mechanics. The solutions are obvious, and you never use the mechanic of CHANGING HOW GAME MECHANICS WORK.Later levels never use the main mechanic of the game, or have few levels that do.If you are interested in the main mechanic alone, do not buy this game. This game isn't about the mechanic shown in the first tutorial world and the trailers.","","A clever, mind-bending puzzle game. This game has just over 200 levels, with a good amount of variety between them. Baba can get quite difficult in some places. As a non-genius, I've resorted to hints a few times to handle puzzles I couldn't make heads or tails out of and recommend the same to most players.Update: After a certain point, the puzzles became too difficult for me. I think there are enough easy\/medium levels in there to still recommend the game to most people, but it's clear to me that \"elite\" puzzle gamers will enjoy Baba the most.","too hard. whatever.","enlyre is smartiswin","I very much enjoyed this game, its quirky style and innovative puzzle mechanics. The presentation was basic but it worked well with the systems and information was usually conveyed clearly, through level design. Thats probably one of the most impressive parts about Baba Is You - theres no tutorial, manual or a guide telling you what to do or how mechanics work. A player has to figure out everything by themselves.This is both the games greatest strength but also its biggest weakness. The puzzles are challenging and with no hints, a player will find themselves mulling over a level for up to half an hour, trying things out. This means getting tired and burned out is a certainty so playing in small doses is preferrable. Definitely dont recommend playing in long sessions, its pretty tiring even though it ends up being satisfying. It also suffered the problem of many other puzzle games in that the music became very repetitive after a while.","All the other negative reviews on this game are basically spot on. A great idea hamstrung by extremely poor execution. Many of the initial puzzles require you to bend rules in fun and creative ways, but later puzzles often have one ultra-specific solution that is based upon rules\/mechanics that the game straight up didn't tell you existed and you're left to bumble into on your own.It reached a head for me in stage 2, Solitary Island, that one puzzle requires you to push text over yourself to complete.Another example is a level in Stage 1, with the very first puzzle requiring you to push text into something to \"sink\" it, which the game never tells you is possible, you're just meant to blindly stumble into it.Continuing on, many levels have different rules that you can't alter in any given way by just locking them off from access, which points you in the direction of those ultra-specific solutions with rules the game forgot to tell you it had. You can't really go hog-wild with the rules to make your own solution, because I see (as I kind of thought earlier) that that would necessitate samey puzzles and lead to the same solution for many of them. Still, I thought I'd give the game a shot, and it disappointed extremely.The music is extremely repetitive and boring too, just to top it off.Watch a playthrough if you wanna see the game yourself, don't buy it.","Baba is you is an incredibly creative, challenging, and unique puzzle game. There's seriously nothing on the market like it. If your into difficult puzzle games and drink brain hurt juice regularly than this is most definitely for you!","Five out of five stars.

And if you dont, try it out anyway.","I play a lot of puzzle games - this is one of the puzzle game greats.  Up there with Braid, Recursed, and Stephen's Sausage Roll.  Has a mechanic as good as that in Recursed, and puzzle design as good as that in Stephen's Sausage Roll.","While Baba is You is a fascinating concept, it communicates its rules poorly to its detriment.Baba is You is a game about discovering the solutions to tricky puzzles, and also discovering the rules to the game itself, which you manipulate.  When it's working well,this is a brilliant experience, whether easy in the simple beginning, or dastardly difficult once you've escaped the initial levels.However, the game is designed deliberately to encourage you to build false ideas of how the rules might work.  What does \"Is Shut\" actually mean?  You won't know the first time you encounter it, and your first experiences will probably give you wrong ideas about it.  Later the game will expect you to find those blind spots and fix them in order to progress.  Those experiences, however, are often combined with puzzles that require additional lateral leaps.  Not knowing the ruleset of the system you're working with while simultaneously struggling with a logic puzzle may be joyous to some, but in practice it can often boil down to random fumbling until something you don't expect happens.The game would be much stronger if by level design or available information, it was more readily discoverable what the rules actually are before you're stuck in a complex puzzle with no idea that you missed some important mechanics.  It's not like this is a novel problem in puzzle game design.  All puzzle makers run up against the problem of the solver not being able to make progress or get anywhere in their puzzles at some point. The good ones eventually learn that a poorly clued puzzle is just a puzzle that isn't very good.","You know that feeling when you beat a hard puzzle and go AH-HA! well, that's not Baba is Youit's more of a \"really? that was it? just had to make my self the whole level and touch the win?\"this is not, good game design, that would be teaching you new game mechanics and making you use them in clever ways, this is just cryptic bs where you have to remember and bend every rule you can in order to continue. with some \"line up the guys and set them to move and stop them at the precise right spots\" tediousness.Baba is not currently enjoyable, but i will beat it giving it's two-hundred 2 minute puzzles.

In most levels at the early-mid game at least, there are so few moving parts that brute-forcing works.In a couple of levels, I have had the patience to reason things out beforehand. These levels have brought me the most enjoyment.I'm still playing it after over 20 hours though, so I guess I'll have to give it a thumbs up anyway.","Brainlet is me :(","A beautiful, challenging, and all-around well-made puzzler.

I'd recommend getting your own music if you want more variety.If neither of those things is a problem, pick this game up right now, I guarantee you will love it. If the difficulty concerns you, I'd perhaps wait until it's on sale.","One of the best puzzle games that I ever played.  It's rare to see Metalogic in games.","(tl;dr: For hardcore puzzle gamers only, otherwise this game will repeatedly make you feel like an idiot.)What is a \"good\" puzzle game?It's one that is challenging, especially in the later levels, but you know exactly what the core mechanisms are. It has zero ambiguity about the basic moves while a great deal of ambiguity on how those moves should be executed. An example of this is the Lemmings franchise. Though there were some horribly difficult levels throughout the games, you never once failed to know exactly what a blocker did. Or what a builder did. Or what any of the other roles did. Your focus was using those roles to get enough lemmings to safety through harder and harder levels. This is a major reason why the franchise was so successful.By contrast, Baba Is You excels at developing challenging levels but fails miserably at explaining what some of the conditions make things do and don't do. It is not just difficult because you do not know WHAT to do; it is too often difficult because you do not know what you CAN do. For example, there's a level where the \"win\" target is also STOP with out any way to either change the target or remove the STOP. And yet to solve it, you have to get Baba and that target onto the same space. Turns out that there is a way to do it that the game simply never explained; it expects that the players will figure it out for themselves.The core mechanic of changing each level's rules on the fly is a clever one. But using the example above, the solution requires deducing a caveat to STOP that the game never explains. It's too easy to think that this caveat doesn't even exist. That's not a good challenge: That's bad game design.If you're a masochist when it comes to solving extremely difficult levels, you may safely ignore my warning and play this game that will hurt your brain so good. But if you're not into that kind of intellectual flagellation, you should know that Baba is You will have you constantly feeling like an idiot. When you do finally figure out levels--and you won't figure out every one--the satisfaction will be minimal, because you'll never know if the next level is one of those tortures that seems designed to make you fail. Save your money and look elsewhere."],["It says I've played 3.3 hours but I'm sure I've only played half. The other half was me staring at the screen trying to figure out what to do and feeling stumped. If you like games that stretch your creative thinking and push you \"outside the box\" then this is for you. It's one of those games that each level seems impossible until you find the solution, and then you feel dumb for not thinking that way to begin with.","this is the yes that hurt my brain the most","Easily the game of the year.If you're stuck, that's because you're still thinking inside the box.Brain is melt.","With the DROD guys retiring from service, I didn't think Stephen's Sausage Roll or The Witness would get another sequel so soon. As a programmer, I thought this game would be home turf, a logical manipulation of rules with which I am accustomed, but Zachtronics spake \"No, this is not my domain\", and thus I was cast into a pit of dumbitude here. I have to admit to consulting a few no-spoilers hint guides on a few of these and regretting it later because those levels where you spend 45 minutes brainstorming \"There's only like 3 possible paths here, what am I overlooking\" and then you step away from it, let your subconscious ponder it for a few hours and the answer clicks are just jewels you take to your grave. Usually it's a solution that involves powergaming the rules, for lack of a better term - something that entails a risky maneuver which seems dead obvious after the fact. None of the solutions require elaborate and lengthy patterns to solve.It is concise and terse and towards the end a little exploratory. Early puzzles that seemed impossible are obvious when you come back to them, and building your brain muscle like that is a hallmark of a well designed puzzle game. 11\/10","Simple design and concept, immaculate execution.You know when you \"cheese\" a level in mario maker or another platformer, or perhaps pull off one of the many glitches in other video games?Baba is You is not only about finding that answer, but also then building on top of that, and taking it to a limit so extreme you could have never forseen it in the first place. That feeling of letting the rules click together and getting another damned dandelion is priceless....also it's getting a level editor in spring, literally what are you waiting for?!","Game is greatBaba is youBaba is buy","Short reviewBaba is puzzlePuzzle has rulesRules are wordsPlayer moves wordsRules are changed Puzzle is hardBrain is meltPlayer finds solutionFeelsGood Baba is must buyFull reviewBaba Is You is a puzzle game where the rules of each puzzle are defined by the words you can see in the level, and the player is able to rearrange the words to change the rules. For example, \"[object] is you\" identifies the character you control, and \"[item] is win\" identifies the thing that you need to touch to solve the puzzle. If \"Baba is you\" and \"flag is win\", you control Baba (a white animal, possibly a cat) and you need to touch the flag. But what if Baba and the flag are on opposite sides of a stream, and \"water is sink\"? As soon as you touch the water, you'll die. You could push \"sink\" away from the other words, and safely walk across the water. But what if \"water is sink\" is on the other side of a wall, alongside \"wall is stop\"? Now you can't get close enough to rearrange those words.  Perhaps there's a way to make something other than the flag be win. Or maybe you don't have to control Baba. This is where the enjoyment of this game begins, as you start rearranging words to experiment with different rules. The main puzzle mechanic is easy to understand, but the complexity comes from all the different words that appear in later puzzles, including \"shut\", \"open\", \"move\", \"defeat\", \"float\", \"hot\", \"melt\", and many more. You can transform an object into something else. You can control more than one thing simultaneously. You can set up an object to push blocks into position while you do something else. Eventually you'll make rules using more than three words. The level design is genius. There are more than 150 puzzles to solve, and the world map is arranged so that at any time you'll have access to 10 or more puzzles. This means that when you get stuck, instead of getting frustrated, you can try a different puzzle, and come back to the other one later with fresh ideas. The later puzzles become very challenging, but they feel great when you finally figure them out. You don't need to solve every puzzle in an area to unlock access to the next one, or to finish the game, but the more you solve the more achievements you'll earn. The length of a puzzle game is quite subjective, but after 25 hours Ive still only solved around 75% of the puzzles. Baba is You is one of the best puzzle games I've played, alongside Talos Principle and Portal. The puzzle mechanics are genuinely unique and I recommend it as an absolute must buy.","Probably THE best puzzle game out there. I enjoyed everything about it. All the puzzles are somewhat unique but there were so many genuinely clever ones - I was impressed. As any good puzzle game, it makes you feel clever and does not unload all the mechanics at once but instead of tutorials everything is laid out in front of you to play with. It is really well put together.If I could have one criticism - the music does not quite do it for me, especially because when I am solving something for a long time it just gets repetitive. I don't think there's a workaround for that problem. From the puzzle perspective - any level that used 'empty' did not feel right.10\/10 - game designed and executed just right","Baba Is Win","Very Good, Baba is Wow and Thank you?","I have not even finished half of the areas in this game yet, but I love it so far. It's INFURIATINGLY brain teasing on many of the levels I've encountered. Much of that frustration tends to be \"Oh, I didn't know I could do that\" or \"Oh, changing those works like that,\" which could be good or bad depending on your perspective and how you play. It's definitely satisfying when you finally figure out a puzzle, though I'm finding a lot of them tend to be more word-based puzzles than mechanics puzzles.The ONLY real complaint I have about the game is that there is only one music piece when you're in a puzzle. It's not a bad background song and much of the time I forget it's even there, but if you like musical variety, you may want to play the game in spurts rather than long sessions.","Game is good, but ehh...","iyi","Amazing puzzle game! Keeps surprising with new interesting mechanics and creative solutions. Highly recommended"],["Right upfront - this is a \"this didn't work for me\" downvote, not a \"this is a crap game\" downvote.There are lots of things to like about Baba is You.I think it's very clever - some of the puzzles are amazing in their creativity and complexity.  The idea is wonderful, and the implementation is perfectly adequate.I should love this game.I was hoping that this would be the kind of charming, quirky puzzler that I could recommend to my mum and we could talk about it.  But as I was playing I realized ... I don't think my mum would enjoy playing this, heck I don't think I'm enjoying playing this.Thinking about this I think it comes down to the (structurally inevitable) style of the puzzles.  They are very very \"programmerly\", which is unsurprising given that it's all about manipulating rules, iterating, testing, thinking about the possible approaches using the available tools and resources, etc.  Again, as a former software engineer this really should be right up my alley.And yet.  The thing that makes a good puzzler game, as others have pointed out, is having that gap between what you know how to do and what you don't (yet) know how to do, and for that gap to seem not insurmountable with enough chipping away and determination.  The puzzles in Baba is You just get so opaque and confounding that it's just ... wearying.  I'm quite happy to accept that I'm just not smart enough at this kind of thinking, but I think there's also a problem with how rewarding it feels to solve these.  There were several instances where taking a break, having a sleep, coming back to a puzzle fresh, did allow me to have a new look at the problem and get to solving the level, but it didn't feel particularly rewarding.  I find myself increasingly reluctant to dive back in knowing I'm going to be bashing my tired brain against seemingly impossible arcane puzzles.I wasn't enjoying launching the game.That's a problem for a game for me.","I'm happy for everyone who enjoyed the game. I didn't.A good puzzle game has to have balanced difficulty, reasonable learning curve and a sense of accomplishment after you beat a level. Baba has neither. About 15 puzzles in I had to start to regularly check walkthroughs and in the end I often discovered the game just didn't explain its mechanics properly and there was some secret behavior I have no idea about. Many solutions felt like exploiting a glitch more than anything else.Sometimes the game even breaks its own rules: You can SWAP into a STOP wall; there's even an animation of you moving into a square which you should not be able to move in. \"A is B and A is C\" sometimes changes A into both B and C and other times says it's invalid. You can FALL through DEFEAT objects even though they should kill you.  And I still have absolutely no idea how EMPTY tiles work.Although I'm a completionist, I gave up halfway through this game, just couldn't bear it any longer. I'm not sure if I've ever played a game more frustrating than Baba.","Rules are simple, but The game is hard. ,Estimate difficulty level  :A to A+  ---  (for normal people) B to A-   ---  (for those who study science\/maths ) Recommend to those who love to use their mind or test their IQ.IQIf you can finish 30+ locations, you're already good.30, 60 locations, your IQ is surely above average.60 IQDon't feel upset\/sham if you can't finish even one area. , .*** Just like real life, some of the problems we're facing have just \"\"ONE\"\" solution and some of the \"rules are hidden\".

That's a little sad, but true. I don't want every game to be built around me.  But when the game initially provides so many beautiful variations in solving puzzles, and eventually all that variation goes away, it just kind of gets sad.

Really really really worth the money!!!!","yes","This is probably the best puzzle game I've ever played. I cannot recommend this game enough to anyone interested in problems that require lateral thinking.Baba is You is a block-pushing game, at least superficially. A classic kind of puzzler with plenty of challenges in its own right. But Baba is You offers a twist on this mechanic that is so all-encompassing that it may as well be its own genre of game, with block-pushing taking the backseat.Every level carries its own rules, typically including \"Baba is You\". So long as those are connected, you control Baba. Perhaps \"Wall is Stop\" will be there as well. So long as they are connected, walls are impassable. The trick is that they don't have to stay connected. Often, you'll be forced to form your own rules in such a way as to make the level beatable or even break rules!It's in this that we find the genius of Baba is You. Puzzles are devilishly simple, but require constant rethinking of how the game's logic works, something unaccustomed to most people. Every level asks you to reconsider how you thought things worked and find ways to make things work in such a way that you can win. The challenge is almost entirely in conception: thinking of what the mind-bending solution is. It's never a trial and error challenge of trying every combination and order, but of figuring out exactly what the challenge really is for that level.Add to this, a pleasant aesthetic with calm music and a charmingly simple gameplay system, Baba is You really has no disappointing aspect for me. Reading the negative reviews, the consensus seems to be that the faults are that the game is underexplained or that interactions are often unpredictable and unclear or that the main mechanic isn't used sufficiently. I can't say that I agree with these faults.Baba is You really doesn't need explaining: any explaining would just diminish what makes it interesting. Every level that has a new text block makes you excited to see what it does, how you can use it and what to make of it. The entire appeal of Baba is You is the slow mastering of every level by experimentation and abstract thinking.Unpredictable and unclear interactions in a game about changing the mechanics of the game seems to be trying to have your cake and eat it to me. I fail to see how a game that is about constantly shaking up how the game works could have ONLY obvious and intuitive interactions. To me, the unclear and unpredictable is part of the fun. You are often cast into the deep end and have to try to think your way out.Finally, not using the main mechanic comes up in some reviews, usually accompanied by saying that later levels often have stationary text that cannot be changed out. While I admit that this can seem superficially disappointing, it's ultimately what leads to actually compelling and interesting puzzles. With some locked rules, Baba is You forces you to play around those limitations which can themselves be changed from level to level. If every level was just about changing the rules of the game and allowing all text to be interacted with, solutions would likely just default to whatever the player last used to beat a level.So in short, I think this is possibly a perfect game and that the criticisms of it that appear here are not really applicable.

This game consistently surprised us with solutions and any levels that were too difficult were usually because we focused too hard on one particular mechanic being the right way to go about things (I'm looking at you Deep Forest-12). Often times I even caught my mind drifitng during the day trying to think of solutions to the puzzle that had stumped us the night before. The puzzles were engaging and entertaining for the entire 60 hours it took 100% the game and I was legitmately sad when Baba was done.Any DLC would be an instant buy for me.","I love puzzle games and I love the brilliant mechanics and puzzle design in this one.But holy crap this is hard. Usually it takes a few levels for me to \"get\" a puzzle mechanic and then the puzzles become a bit easier, but somehow almost every single level in this one manages to break my brain anew.","I have a feeling this game will last me for awhile. I love puzzle games, especially ones where you have to figure out the mechanics and rules by yourself through trial and error. I bought this on sale, but I would have definitely been happy paying full price for this game.","BABA IS GOOD","clever girl"],["Simple and lot of fun!","I love the mechanics of this game, 100% original idea.I'm not recommending BABA is YOU because i feel like most puzzle games teach you how to play pretty well. Whereas this game has an insanely hard difficulty ramp.

It requires you to actually think, and some puzzles can be quite easy, mind you still not \"easy\" in a normal sense, and then there are \"those\" puzzles. Like, what the hell am i supposed to do? And then you give up, search for the answer online and its so simple. I think I bought this for like 5 dollars, worth the pain to me.","Baba Is You may very well be the perfect puzzle game. It is definitely one of the best puzzle games I have ever played, if not the best.The reason BIY is so good is that it is purely a game about logic, eliminating any randomness, trial&error and other similar problems many puzzlers have. The main gameplay consists of moving around the tiles that make up the rules of the level. For example, forming \"Rock Is Push\" means you can push rocks in the level; removing \"Push\" from this equation by moving that tile away means rocks cant be pushed anymore. It is as simple as the art style, but it forms some really mind-bending puzzles: a total of 226, in fact, if you do all of them. The rules never change, but what you do with them defines how you solve puzzles - which is probably the best approach for puzzle games.BIY also makes me happy because I am actually able to say \"Wow, I am just too dumb for this level lol\" instead of blaming the game for it. Its a game I had absolutely no shame looking up (many) solutions for, since there was no way I wouldve been able to finish the game 100 % otherwise. Its both simple and amazingly complex, and it may very well be the perfect puzzle game (with a simple and clean soundtrack to boot). If you love to challenge yourself and find your limits, or if you love any sort of puzzler, just get this as soon as you can.Personal Rating: 10\/10.","Great GameGraphics 4\/10Lag NonePuzzle 10\/10Story 0\/10","Deserves a Nobel Prize in game design.","Brain is Hurty","Baba is you is a great, creative and challenging puzzle game.

I find the difficulty fair, being that it is possible to derive the solution without trial and error most of the time. That said, not everyone appreciates such endeavours. The levels are frustrating to solve and only those of us who can see pass the suffering can appreciate the game as it is -- a well-crafted puzzle-solving gem.There is a vibrant community out there creating level packs that cater to a wide audience. If you have purchased the game and find the main game unpalatable due to the difficulty, there are packs that aim to demonstrate the possibilities of the game while keeping the puzzles accessible.

If you'd like to watch some gameplay and listen to an audio reading of this, follow this Youtube link: https:\/\/youtu.be\/P_I78z8MWS0 I shouldnt be surprised that I cant even come close to finishing Baba is You. If its world map is any indication, I got just under halfway through before running into a wall, the likes of which I cant get past without collaborating with others during my livestream or resorting to a guide - The latter however feels like a last resort in puzzle games. Its to no fault of the game as it functions, gives you all the necessary information up front, is simple to control and introduces new rules at a healthy rate which only opens up new possibilities and obstacles which can be bonkers to overcome later on. If anything the fault lies within my silly self not being able to wrap my head around being Baba.Word Conjunctions and Statements: The Game wouldnt be that far off in explaining what Baba is You is all about. Take word blocks and put them together to create rules which then affects entities, objects and the environment. Baba is You means that the titular sheep-looking-thing is controlled by the player. Wall is Stop means that walls are impassable. Skull is Defeat means that bumping into a skull requires rewinding or restarting so on. The game has such easy wording to follow that it doesnt take long to read the level and figure out what each rule means in relation to how to win, but putting the pieces and words together to allow said winning is where things get difficult - When I say putting words together, thats meant literally. Pushing a block allows one to break that rule or to use it elsewhere to form a new one. For example: Wall is Stop can have any of those blocks pushed out of the way which leads to walls no longer being impassable barricades, but pushing Wall into is Win leads to said wall tiles now allowing victory if touched. The early game might sound easy but that doesnt last very long. My first thought about the game was how it uses grade school english and somehow won the hearts of many - Typical cynicism of me which naturally ended up being wrong. I would catch snippets of game developers on social media praising it but was curious as to why the press and other consumers were mostly quiet about it. Well touch on why I think that is later, but in hindsight its clear that people who make games had more to say about it than those who play them for work and hobby. Baba is You has that funny knack for making you feel like the smartest person in the room, but the very opposite is true when stuck on a puzzle and just staring at it in disbelief - With simple words and all the tools available, one just needs to push the right words together, right?Box has Key but Box is Weak, but why not then make Box has Key and Box so that when Box breaks from Weak it spawns a new box but also a key? But Key doesnt have is Push so that when Key appears it cant be pushed into Door since Door is Shut which leads to Flag is Win. Why not make Key is You so that when Key appears you can control Key and to go Door, but using yourself ends up in a fail state since Key is gone but youre no longer Baba and-You can see how things get silly. Dont even get me started when Baba is Baba is introduced.Later levels end up having so many working parts or needing to break the rule logic that once the solution clicks its a wonderful rush of satisfaction - Said clicks take a while to arrive though, and in my case I spent more time scratching my head and humming in thought than racking up solutions. I frequently threw my hands up in exasperation claiming that a level is impossible, only to then have everything make sense once the solution came together.I try to avoid using tropes whenever possible but I have to pull out my this game isnt for me card. A friend of mine on Discord, Maxwell, summed up why that might be pretty conclusively:  It's a game by programmers for programmers. It's a niche that got big for a while, and while this game is far more accessible than most of the field, there's still going to come a moment where a layperson's ability just won't be enough.While unable to contact the developer for clarification, when looking at Baba is You through the eyes of a programmer it makes astronomically more sense as to why later levels become so heavy and thorough with the number of rules to form and break. This also is likely why other developers took more from it than others.I found my brief bouts of solving levels and its ensuing joy being overshadowed by how often I would stare at the screen in stumped frustration. Some people can enjoy being in that situation; figuring out and solving these brain busters and getting gratification out of it - I just end up feeling really dang dumb. To reiterate, Baba is You is far from bad or meriting criticism for being so challenging. Its a puzzle game where the solution is right in front of you, its just a matter of piecing it all together -  I just dont have the cranial capacity for it and still have a good time while doing so. Its a weird position to be in; recommending a game that I cant complete to save my life without resorting to a guide, but here we are. Baba is You is rotten for having so many sly, canny moments and ideas that definitely merits a buy, though under the caveat to know what youre in for.","i love this game as its new its refreshing its a new idea the idea is great and also greatly executed and also really hard plus only 70 mb so you can play it on anything 8.5 outta 10","duuuuuuuuuuuuuuhh UhgggHH uuuuuuuuu              mmmm mmm uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuhhhdyuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuGGGH !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

In terms of the mechanics and the puzzles created with them, I'd consider Baba is You to be the equal of the Portal games and that is not praise I offer lightly. It is rather lacking in some other areas because the central mechanic (clever and well-explored though it is) makes it nearly impossible to tell any kind of coherent story. Also, the only concession to making the game less frustrating is that you can skip a ton of levels and still progress.Still though, Baba is You is an excellent game to spend a few days on, and I'd heavily recommend it especially for anyone with an interest in game design.","BIG BRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIN"],["One of the best puzzle games I have ever played.

In the face of some of the puzzles this one throws at you. Each level is brilliant, devious, maddening, and each one also usually teaches you a different clever trick about how to manipulate word combinations or world objects.Put your sudoku work book away, THIS is how you get to Big Brain Time.Despite this seemingly severe appraisal, I really love this game. The spritework is cute. The music is simple, pleasant, and unobtrusive, a perfect tempo for your brain to grind its gears so while you ponder. The game's options are pretty comprehensive- want the world to stop wiggling? Checkbox for that. Want it to stop its animations too? Checkbox. Fullscreen? Ye. Windowed fullscreen? Ye. Music? Begone. Warning menu for restarting a level? Up to you!The game world moves in ticks and only ticks when you move or take a wait action, so you can sit there and stare dumbly at the puzzle before for as long as you'd like. If you've pushed a block or object somewhere you don't want it to be, there's an undo button that rolls you back a tick every time you press it, all the way to the very start of the level. Instead of mistakes requiring restarts, it asks you to do little rollbacks instead, and so the time to fix things is literally in seconds. Your inputs are in four directions, to wait a turn, and to undo. That's the entirety of the controls of the game (well, and the restart button, but), and there is a massive, maddening collection of truly brilliant puzzles built on that.It boots up quick, every puzzle is self-contained, there's no time constraint, and the fundamentals of the game are all simple enough that you can pick it up and put it down literally any time you want. Ten minutes to pluck at a puzzle before work? Got it. Leave it on in the background while you muse over it while preparing dinner? You can do that. Gotta step away to feed Baby? The world wiggles on, but waits right there for you. Haven't played in three months? Right there where you left it, and everything is familiar again.And that's it, really. Six buttons, a little over two hundred puzzles, a bunch of wiggly sprites, and some words to push around. It's brilliant at every step.Full recommendation. Buy it full price.

If you love breaking rules, this game is definitely for you.","baba has become meI am one with babaI shall spread baba to the world","Mechanically unique. If you like puzzle games in general, there is no reason to *not* buy this game at least to try it out.I feel like some of the levels get a bit too complex with a dozen of objects to move around, but that's just a subjective problem. Many of the smaller levels with only a few (4-5) objects are almost as difficult, but I really like how these minimal puzzles can get really difficult with only a couple of moving parts.It does get repetitive at times. Personally I like to play this in small doses, a few levels now and a few more levels tomorrow.As for the amount of content: there's a lot of levels to play through (176). You can also skip about half of the levels and still progress forward to new levels, so it's unlikely that you'll get completely stuck.4\/5 would buy again.","Wonderful concept with a good level design.

It looks like a really simple game, but it very quickly becomes quite challenging.  Many puzzles require a shift in perception to succeed.","Changing the rules is surprisingly fun.","Baba Is You is a fun, unique and clever puzzle game. Most puzzle games are very simple and straightforward or revolve around spacial reasoning (worst yet there are puzzle games with arbitrary reasoning and poorly crafted hints). Baba Is You is different and does a heck of a job at testing your cleverness. Be forewarned though a good portion of the game is testing what sentences you can form and what effects they have. Sometimes through this testing the solution will pop out.","BABA is YOU is FUN and EXCITING. PUZZLE is CHALLENGE and BRAIN is MELT not PAIN. START is SIMPLE. NOT START is HARD.

Solving harder challenges is super satisfying, though, and even though I'm probably only halfway through the game I've heard that things get pretty crazy later on and I'm exciting to see just how deep the rabbit hole of rule-shaping and breaking goes.","Clever game with a cute style.","I bought this game expecting (as a computer science major) a relatively simple challenge. What I received was a simple in concept, yet deceptively difficult puzzle game. And honestly? I'm loving every second of it. For reference, I've spent most of my hours in FPS titles for most of my current life. I'm about 90 or so puzzles in, and I have to say, not only is it one of the most refreshing games I've played - it is quite possibly one of the best games I'll ever play, puzzle or otherwise. Let me explain. I have more hours than currently listed on my profile for this game, as I'll find myself staring (essentially idling) at the screen, sometimes with a friend or two watching and throwing out ideas. It's a game that requires you to experiment and tinker with your board state, and ultimately rewards you for doing so. Fixing a mistake is as simple as undoing or restarting, and thankfully, the game doesn't punish you for it.No other game has given me as much a rush of exhilaration as this one. Solving a puzzle that you've spent a bit of time on is incredibly gratifying. They may take time - sometimes more time than you'd expect. You might have to take breaks and come back to it later. Sometimes, you'll have to bounce around puzzles to understand how one mechanic might help you somewhere else. That moment of clarity that you get after clearing a puzzle is, without a doubt, one of the best experiences you'll have playing this game, but I'd argue that the journey before getting there is where this game truly shines. It's difficult without a doubt, but using a guide to play this game rids yourself of these moments. It's not it makes you a \"bad\" gamer - you just lose out on having these moments, which ruins, I think, the entire purpose of this game. It's going to require some testing and a large amount of lateral thinking. If you're even thinking about buying this game, don't rob yourself of the journey by watching someone else play through the game or by reading a hint guide.Not every puzzle has to be completed in order to win the game. And yet, I've never felt more compelled to go beyond what the game requires. Never mind the money you'd spend to play this game - Baba is You is absolutely worth your time and effort.Tl;dr: Read my review, and then buy this game.","One of the best puzzle game in the world !","Baba is you is win","Countless hours of joy.

Puzzles range from incredibly easy to mind-destroyingly hard.","Brain is hurt","Baba is you is a puzzle game that is hard by design. to explain, Baba at its core is difficult but cannot be tweaked or changed without making it not Baba. this makes Baba extremely unique as some puzzles will sometimes take hours to complete. baba also has a smooth linear progression in puzzle difficulty, which slowly introduces players to new mechanics while finding new quirks about old ones. for example, baba is you and baba is move makes you move 2 spaces and unable to go through some hallways in a conventional way. another way baba is difficult is not finding the solution, but all of the 'not solutions'. you will more than likely try something in a level and have it not work, allowing you to indirectly progress through said level, albeit very slowly. baba is also meta-physical, so the game encourages you to try things that logically shouldn't work, but ends up working anyways. this often times leads to the solution to a level.to summarize, baba is the greatest puzzle game of the decade. and I can say that statement with confidence.Review is Done.","These puzzles are frustrating and make my head hurt, but every time you solve one you feel so good.","This game is really creative. It seems to start out simple, but you'll still be like \"damn I'm glad I can manipulate the level like that\". A lot of levels have multiple ways to win, and hilarious ways to interact with it. The later levels get really difficult, but it makes it all the more fun to solve them. Sometimes you'll stare at it for a long time until it just clicks as to what you need to do.This is one of the most creative games I have played, and I can *easily* recommend it for anyone","GAME is AMAZINGSeriously though, this game has so much inginuity and originality ! If it weren't for game developing, I think the devs of this game could single-handedly save this planet and transcend our species to the next level. Too bad we're just stuck with an amazing game. That said, I've been on and off of it since it is so hard, but you can't ever get stuck in the way that you can't do anything. If you can't do a level there'll be tens of others that unlock even more of them.To end it all off, I'd like to quote the video review that convinced me into buying this game:\"You want out of the box ? In this game you ARE the box\" - and that can't be more on point","This is probably the most innovative, inventive, and creative game I've played in ten years.","A superb puzzle game. The rules are written in tiles that can be pushed around, allowing you to reorganize them. The puzzles are small, compact and just the right amount of challenging to require out of box thinking and to really wring your brain cells without becoming long-time blockers.","This is my Game of the Year choice so far for 2019. It's the most unique puzzle game I've ever played. I was interested in the early game by the unique game mechanics and interactions. By midgame I was impressed to see that each new level was still fresh, and the creator didn't seem to run out of ideas. By the late game I was amazed at what the game did with the concept. A lot of puzzle games wear out their welcome, but Baba is You saved the best for last. This game is worth sticking out until the end, and it's worth staying unspoiled and experiencing it for yourself. There's nothing quite like feeling you've exhausted every possible option on a level, and getting that moment of realization. I learnt a lot of how blind my brain is to some solutions, and the game can make you feel like a genius and an idiot. If you get really stuck, you can find a hint guide \"Baba is Hint\", which gives gentle nudges in the right direction without giving the direct solution..","epic game.","If you're into puzzle games it just doesn't get better than this","[baba][money][is][buy][play][and][fun]","baba is you is great puzzle game and i recommend you get it","great idea great execution","Baba keeps kicking my ass.If you like difficult puzzles, then you'll like this.

It's closer to learning a programming language than it is solving a jigsaw puzzle.If you like game design, programming, puzzle solving, or all three, play this game.My brain hurts.","Mindblowing! Innovative! Very very long...","Don't get me wrong, the game isn't bad and the first levels are interesting and fun, but the later levels are way too difficult and to solve them you often have to use strategies that more feel like abusing glitches and less like developing a valid strategy. It would also be better if levels had multiple solutions, but unintended solutions are often patched out instead of embracing them.Another problem is that you often have tons of available levels at a time, but many of these levels are pretty much unsolvable as you haven't solved the level yet that introduces the required strategy. But you don't really know which levels requires which level as a prerequisite. That could have been solved by making the levels more linear.The biggest problem so far is that the game doesn't really teach you. The first puzzles are easy enough on their own and don't require tutorials or anything like that, but the later puzzles are really hard and it's frustrating to be stuck because you can't figure out a new and unintuitive mechanic on your own. Giving little hints through a story and again making it more clear and linear, would improve the game a lot. Kinda like how the Portal series teaches the mechanics through the story and little interactions without giving away the solutions to the puzzles.To add to that, graphics and music are fine, but they could definitely be better and the music gets repetetive after some time.","Yes.","Baba Is Recommended","I'm sure you've heard this all before in other reviews etc, but Baba is You really is a brilliant game. It's a simple idea; you can push words together to change the rules. For example, BABA + is + YOU means that you control the character Baba. WALL + is + STOP means that the walls stop you from passing them. Remove a term from \"WALL is STOP\" and suddenly the walls don't stop you anymore and you can walk through them. Perhaps you want to become the wall, and with some careful fiddling, you can!All the levels in Baba is You are puzzles based around these rules, and it isn't as easy (or difficult!) as it might sound. I found it pretty easy to get my head around the concept, and the game is full of creative ideas. When a new word comes up, it's exciting, and though I haven't finished yet I'm going to try my best to get there.BABA is GOOD.","Easily one of the most creative and mind-bending puzzle games I've ever played. I personally wasn't quite able to wrap my head around the later portions, which is why I haven't been able to finish it, but that should be a testament to just how good it is at testing and breaking your logic. Plus it's super cute.","A great puzzle game. Hard puzzles that are fun once you figure out what all you can do.

Sometimes it's too hard, but that's why you can skip levels!","Very clever","Just buy it. no description will do it justice.  if you like puzzles , it's awesome. you really need to think outside the box.","A mind twisting game with a lot of efforts put into its creation. Great design, lovely characters, and many hours that would cost you in the game.","challenging and rewarding 15\/21","","too great","This game is very interesting","It's a brilliant puzzle game that plays like nothing else out there.Now, the game starts off easy, but still very fun. It's pretty open, allowing you to solve puzzles in a variety of ways and learn all the small intricacies of its mechanics.Later on though, Baba is You becomes brutally hard. Now, I'm not a master of puzzle games, but I wouldn't call myself terrible. Well Baba is You kicked my butt only a few areas in. I cannot imagine what kind of stuff happens later.Of course, this extra difficulty also means that the levels become progressively more linear, with only one way to solve them (occasionally there might be a second). I feel like the openness of the earlier levels and all the ways we could play with the mechanics was by far the most fun thing about this game, at least for me.With new levels come more mechanics, more and more toys to play with. And because the mechanics are literally words that you see on screen at all times, they are always easy to understand and remember.The inclusion of the undo button makes any minor mistake instantly fixable, which meant that something that would frustrate me in other puzzle games is completely solved.If there was one thing I could really complain about, it would be the graphics. I do not like how the game looks. Does that change my opinion on the game? Not one bit. The graphics being good would have been a bonus.","Baba is You is a the personification of a meta game. You change rules to be able to solve puzzles, but as you progress through the game, you will transcend the definition of a level and fall down a rabbit hole where all the meaning of the world dissolves as you learn more and more ways to manipulate things you once thought were core mechanics innate to the world.At first, you will stumble blindly, trying to make sense of what you see. You experiment, you make mistakes, you're forced to take a step back (with the handy undo function) and rethink your solution. But the pieces gradually fall into place as you figure out the trick, and armed with the new knowledge, you can solve the puzzle. But as you gain mastery over the game's mechanics, you will manipulate not just pushable blocks, but concepts, core mechanics of the game, and at the end, you will push around entire levels to your liking as just a simple step in solving an even greater mystery. (That's not just me being poetic, that's an actual thing you do later on in the game.)You will learn to appreciate the beauty of a puzzle solution in a way that somebody that has not gone through the same acute pain and riveting revelations can never understand. You will learn to open your mind in a way that is essentially zen meditation. You will learn to see all things as the meaningless empty vessels they are, think about how to fill them with meaning, and use them to achieve your goals. And you will emerge on the other side as a better person, albeit with a melted brain.","This game is just hilarious!!! It's surprising that this kind of a game was released so late, but fortunately it's here. Big kudos to the creator!!!","Possibly the hardest game I've played. Super creative. Worth a play if you wanna feel really dumb a lot and then really really smart like once every four hours","much gooded","Game is good","This is a great puzzle game that you can play whenever you feel bored. Most levels are difficult enough to make you think about what to do for at least 5-10 minutes, and the harder ones I haven't even finished yet10\\10","yes, but you need a major in astronomy, psychology, and rocket science to get past LEVEL FOUR","Probably the most interesting and challenging puzzle game I've played. It's literally about modifying the rules to create a solution to a problem, it has a lot of mechanics and possibilities.However, I was quite disappointed that in a lot of levels, multiple solutions would have been possible but the developers created rules to make all of them invalid except for the one that they expect. It would have been more interesting, in my opinion, to let multiple solutions be possible, which gives more freedom and creativity to the user while keeping high challenges.","This is the best puzzle game I've ever played. It's insanely clever and incredibly rewarding.","puzzle  very cool","good","Baba is You is one of the most brilliant puzzle games that I have ever played, and I don't mean that lightly. The game does so much with so little in that it seems simple but actually becomes incredibly complex. It's a game that challenges what you are used to by having you alter the most basic rules of gameplay to your convenience. The game has many concepts in the form of words, many of which are incredibly unique in what they do. The game adapts a showing-rather-than-telling mentality in its tutorials, allowing for experimentation instead of explanation, which is excellent for a game like this. Not only are the mechanics interesting, but they also work quite well with other mechanics. These words never get stale. As soon as a word seems to run out of potential, the game combines it with various other words, which greatly increases the potential for these concepts. Every word has an abundance of potential, and with a few unfortunate exceptions, all of these reach their full potential, or at least a higher potential than I would have come up with. It's possible that there are even more secrets to these words that are not apparent from the main game. Each area of the game introduces new words before expanding upon them, as previously mentioned. However, the words are not the only creative part of the game. The level designs are extremely unique. No two levels feel the same. They all have extremely different solutions and ideas to test. That includes some levels that look incredibly similar. There are some bonus levels that look almost exactly like regular levels except for one change. That one change drastically changes the solution into something brand-new. I never knew what I was going to face next. The game gets even more insane in the final areas (I'm not giving any spoilers for that greatness, but you'll know it when you see it). In terms of difficulty, the difficulty curve is amazing. The game starts out very easy, giving you time to learn the mechanics, but within a few areas, you will likely start to struggle. The game ends with some of the hardest puzzles that I have seen in a while (and I'm a big puzzle game fan). There are also plenty of challenging optional puzzles in the early areas to keep you entertained\/thinking until it really gets hard. As for the cost, this game is incredibly worthwhile. 100%ing this game took me about 50 hours to complete all 226 levels (at the time of me writing this recommendation). This game is only worth $15, which is absolutely a steal. If you are a puzzle game fan, this game is a must play. It is very challenging, and the creativity is abundant. I would say that the only thing that this game is missing is a level editor, but the creator is currently working on that (at the time of this comment).","Baba Is BestInLibraryIsWin","Game Is What?Imagine a Sokoban-style game that involves pushing blocks around and whatnot just like all the other Sokoban-style games. Now, imagine that the game's rules are written on some of those blocks. Imagine what you could achieve if you moved those words around and rewrote the rules. And imagine everything you could make possible...... or, you could play Baba Is You and experience it instead of just imagining it.Design Is CleverThere are two key things you need to get right when making a puzzle game:1. Come up with interesting game mechanics2. Design levels that make great use of said game mechanicsThankfully, this particular game is one that fulfils both of these with flying colours. It's one thing to be able to manipulate the rules of a game, but it's another to present the player with such clever and crafty level design that requires hardcore outside-the-box thinking. The overall concept may sound simple enough, but the ways in which the levels use the game's mechanics so creatively are what make the entire experience truly incredible.Now, I refuse to give spoilers in this review because I don't want to ruin the experience for those of you who haven't played this game yet, but one thing I will say is to expect the unexpected. There's more to this game than meets the eye. Everything's not what it seems. You get the idea. This is honestly the first puzzle game that has ever made me feel a real sense of exploration and excitement, as though I am \"entering the unknown\" and discovering things I'm probably never supposed to know. Parts of the game will leave you shocked and astounded. You will be confused, and believe me, you will enjoy this confusion immensely.Presentation Is LovelyIn addition to being a fun, exciting and rewarding game to play, Baba Is You is also beautifully presented. All the graphics have a playful wiggly outline thing going on (Ed, Edd 'n Eddy, anyone?) and, despite the art style being very minimalist, I find the sprites really cute! I mean, who in their right mind wouldn't want to hug Baba? The typography is also of a consistent style that compliments the art and animation perfectly, and the typeface is clear and easy to read. Which is especially important for a game that revolves around making and breaking the rules.A simple yet absolutely charming soundtrack and suitable in-game sound effects go hand-in-hand with the game's visual aesthetics. I actually find the music quite calming. This is one of the few puzzle games I've played (right before going to bed, I might add) that hasn't lost me any sleep, which is surprising because there were times where I was stuck on a level for days. But this game never left me feeling anxious either. Confused, yes, but not anxious. Perhaps the sweet graphics and chilled music played a factor in this?Game Is RecommendedI am so passionate about Baba Is You that I just want everyone to play it and experience it for themselves! As I already said, there are no spoilers in this review, but for that reason I can't rave about it as much as I want to either. So play it, see for yourself what I'm all hyped about, and let's chat. It's that kind of game.My personal favourite game of 2019!"],["Will make you realize just how stupid you are while at the same time making you feel like a genius. Not unlike actual programming.","It's a good puzzle game but it pretty quickly abandons the \"break the rules\" aesthetic to become a standard puzzle game that accrues new rules faster than it teaches them. The style is great but it would have benefited a lot from a more gradual difficulty curve to teach the various rules before piling them on, even if that meant abandoning a little variety.","I have no clue what I'm doing but I've made it like 2 steps into the game and I'm already lost.","Where most puzzle games tend to be easy and then ramp up to medium when they end at 4 hours, having barely explored their mechanics, this game has dozens of hours of great puzzles that emerge from a simple set of mechanics. This is easily the best puzzle game since The Witness.","This game is fantastic! It's so fun to play.","This game is amazing","Possibly my favorite puzzle game ever.  Very difficult but rewarding.","It's just a really fun and innovate puzzle game, I don't really have much else to say about it though.","Tried hard to enjoy this game as I am a fan of puzzle games. I'm also a retired computer programmer, so when I looked at the videos for this game I thought if would be perfect for me.Unfortunately, after the first few levels, the game became pure frustration. I think the reason I didn't enjoy the game is my programmer\/analytic brain  - I want clear rules and if by those rules a solution should work, it has to work, otherwise the game is a failure.This game reminds me of a bad computer adventure game, where there are multiple logical ways of solving a puzzle, but only one works.","Very frustrating, like a good puzzle game should be.","Well thought out puzzles with interesting solutions and great progression. Not too slow or too quick.","Severe case of \"out of the box thinking\".It's a mind-bending, cerebrum-melting puzzle game, where the premise is quite simple: every rule that defines the level is also a part of the level itself and can be interacted with.The consequences of the above are massive - I wholeheartedly invite you to delve into this game and see for yourself (and have your head scorched from intense thinking).DEFINITELY recommend.","Easily the best and most complex puzzle game I've ever played, designed in a brilliant way to build a stepping stone path of ideas as you learn how the world works and add new tools to your belt.

I am too stupid to play this game.If you're good at puzzle games you've probably already played this, if you haven't, you'll probably like it.If you're dumb like me, steer clear.","This is the most mind bending game I have ever played, and probably the best puzzle game I have ever played. It's quite possibly even the best game I have ever played period.In Baba Is You spatial puzzles are elegantly combined with lateral thinking puzzles. The puzzles are designed to explicitly test your curiosity and challenge your intuitions, giving you a very satisfying feeling of revelation when the puzzle pieces finally fit together and you understand how the level works. The puzzles also reward you for exploring by showing just how devoted the game is to its concept. It's incredibly satisfying to wonder \"wait a minute, if I do this, what would that actually do?\" and to have my curiosity rewarded with some pretty incredible surprises.The game seems to go out of it's way to restrict some puzzle solutions, but many levels can still be solved in a few different ways, so it only restricts the gameplay just enough to keep everything interesting and to keep the solutions to the levels unique and satisfying. Often times after looking at a level that at first seemed easy I would have to rethink everything about that level, and sometimes everything about the mechanics themselves, in order to solve it. This has the effect of slowly teaching you how the mechanics work without ever needing to resort to hand holding.A word of warning though, some levels can be very challenging, so be prepared for that. Its a good thing the levels are so easy to pick up and put down, because Ive got stuck on some of the trickier levels. You also unlock enough levels in normal play that if you get really stuck its always possible to just move on and come back to a level that has you stumped with a fresh mind later.As a final note, I think this game has genuine merit as a general educational tool to introduce someone to some concepts in programming and logic and it encourages creative thinking. I actually think I'm better for having played it.10\/10","This game surprised me in how many different twists it had. I won't go so far as to say that EVERY level had a new trick, but it did happen with striking regularity. Playing through this game isn't just a matter of grasping a few methods and applying them on increasingly bigger and more complicated levels - it is a journey of discovery, where you are constantly challenged to figure out a new way to combine the elements at your disposal.","Amazing","Fun small game that get's progressively harder, meaning it's a challenge or good for anyone that enjoys a good puzzle.Has a lot of content to.","Just got this for a Sunday afternoon with the family.Very smart and enjoyable.

Still, the satisfaction when you do finally crack the inscrutable logic of a particularly frustrating puzzle and manage to walk to the flag, or walk the flag to you, or just decide the flag doesn't mean anything and win with a door instead can't be over-stated.Baba is you. Everything is Baba. Baba is win.","This game made me realize i'm more stupid than I thought.","This game is simply amazing.

It has pretty unique game mechanics and I recommend it to people who are looking for a \"think outside the box\" type of challenge.

It's hard to believe that a game where you only use the arrow keys and don't have a time limit can be so difficult.  However, the game's challenges are based around changing the rules of each level as opposed to simply trying to reach the exit.As a side note, this game is arguably one of the most successful \"Sokoban\" type games, which there's been dozens of them and many are here on Steam.  Believe it or not, this game was developed by a single developer, Arvi Teikari, who came up with the idea at a game jam while he was still a student at the University of Helsinki.  The game won the Excellence In Design and Best Student Game at the IGF Awards, which is unprecedented.","Baba Is You is an absolutely brilliant game.Every level completed will make you feel like Albert Einstein on cocaine discovering (E = MC^2) TWO.The constraints of the game are set, explored, then broken, then set, then explored, then broken over and over again.There is no puzzle game that compares.","One of the most challenging puzzle games I have ever played.

The biggest reason I enjoy the puzzles in Baba is You is because they're (weirdly) less about how to get to the end and more about how the mechanics allow you to get to the end. It's a very specific difference that is hard to describe, but if you like puzzle games you should 100% pick this up.","Baba Is You is probably one of my favourite puzzle games. What it lacks in story is makes up for in raw gameplay mechanics. The gameplay is akin to programming language, using keywords to assemble the rules for every level. My only main complaint is that in the later levels the difficulty can spike erratically (though your mileage may vary.)","Fun.","Awesome puzzle game. I still haven't beat every level, some of them are very difficult. Simple concept with some interesting ideas.

Genial!","YOU NOMINATED THIS GAME FOR:THE BEST GAME YOU SUCK AT AWARD","Baba is You.You is Win.","Baba Is You is, generally, a pretty simple game. Not simple in that the puzzles are easy, but simple in action, direction, and goal.The puzzles start pretty simple, but slowly start ramping up in difficulty as you start to learn new conditions or encounter new obstacles. The conditions in the puzzles, as well as the thinking in the puzzles are reminiscent of software programming at a low level, starting with simple equality statements, with AND and NOT operators appearing soon after. Finding which one takes precedent is part of the experimentation, as well as learning what new modifiers do.This is a kind of game that will definitely take a lot of brain power, and if you ever get frustrated, do not despair! Take a break from the game, stand up and stretch, get a drink of water, and come back at it with a fresh look at the puzzle.If I had the option, I would nominate this game for almost all of the 2019 Steam Awards categories it can apply to, but since I can only nominate this game for one category, I think that Baba Is You deserves my vote for Game of the Year award.","This game is way too smart for my brain.","Amazing logic puzzle game with a fantastic twist. Still haven't beat it because it's so hard for me! 6.5\/10","Very cute game with interesting game play mechanics.The many different words and many different interactions allow for introducing the game chunks at a time and slowly introducing new words and how they cash and interact with other wordsThe game itself is quite difficult once you dive deeper into the game as it gets a little bit META, but otherwise its a cute puzzle game with many different cute and colorful puzzles.","Baba is you and heart","the baba was me all along","I've only played this game for a few minutes and I can already say that the clever design of the puzzles and the cute animation make this game a delight to play and a nice little challenge!","Fantastic visual style, with clever and interesting puzzles!","This Is Review","baba is you is a puzzle game that breaks the rules. literally. you must push around rule blocks in order to create a ruleset that allows a solution. word blocks must be reconfigured to create new rules and dismantle the old ones. It's hard to explain, but it's sokoban with logic operators in an incredibly tight presentation. Some of the later puzzles have taken me days to complete. some of them will frustate you,  some of them will make you laugh, and others are oddly heartwarming. ALL are challenging. I swore to go through this game sans walkthrough and that pushed my complete run to about EIGHT FANTASTIC MONTHS. if you don't mind cheating and actually dedicate yourself to completing puzzles in chunks, you could probably run through it in a month, or a week if you are a genius (or cheat a lil bit). after a while, i played like a crossword or sodoku, just doing one every few days. There are over 215 puzzles, and about 150 of those require real, dedicated thought to complete. I know my play time is short here, but thats because i have finally completed the game on Switch. I have purchased it here to support the dev and snag a sweet soundtrack. Baba is you has meant a lot to me since it's release. Every morning or so as part of my routine, i would fire up a puzzle take a crack at it, and let it sit around in my head over the course of the day. this software is a eureka generator. a few times i would wake up in the middle of the night with the solution. it really gets in your head and changes how you think about rules and operation as a concept.I would reccomend baba is you to anyone looking to listen to some chill tunes, solve riddles and enjoy a good game.","Nominated this game for the most innovative gameplay. It is pretty creative and quite challenge. Typically puzzle games are fairly easy but I struggle with this one in a good way.","this is a great game with innovative mechanics","you're a little sheep blob solving puzzles, what's not to love?","The puzzles are designed in very planned way. It pushes you from the level 1 itself to think and complete the puzzle. After completing each level the proud feeling touches sky high. Moreover, the puzzle system in the game is something ,where you have to create your own instruction and make rules for the game. So, yeah, the game turns out to be a fun puzzle game, which i recommend.","Challenging and fun!","GAMEIS GOODIncredibly unique gameplay with puzzles that will leave you feeling mentally challenged (in a good way).","surprisingly good puzzle game","An adorable game with simple controls but complex puzzles to solve, Baba Is You attracts players with its charming art style and deceptively-challenging game play.

They force you to apply the knowledge you have about the mechanics in new ways. You'll have to think outside the box, and finally solving a puzzle like this is great.Unfortunately, there are several levels where the 'outside-the-box' application of a mechanic that you're supposed to use is incredibly unintuitive and almost impossible to discover without trial-and-error. These puzzles are not fun, and I've have looked up the solutions of a few puzzles like this (You can usually tell that the level kinda sucks when you look up the solution and know that you never would've even gotten close to figuring it out).This complaint does seem like I'm just bad at solving the puzzles (and perhaps it is), but since I can solve most of the levels as long as I think hard enough, I definitely feel as though there are just a few random levels that really could be more clear.Overall, however, Baba Is You is a great puzzle game.","GAMEISGOOD","I'm too dumb for this game but it's very good","Very good game","It good","BABA is FUN","I am bad but game is good","GAME IS GOODISINNOVATIVEANDCHALLENGING            BABAPLAYER IS YOU             WIN","one of the best logic\/puzzle gamesif you love puzzle games you should definitely play thisthe game mechanic is simple but so ingenious. the puzzles are well designed and can get really hard really quickly, even with only a few puzzle elements. but it rarely gets repetitive\/boring and is very good at introducing new concepts along the way it forces you to think outside the boxalso soundtrack and visuals are great, so that's a plus","Brilliant!","jogo de puzzle muito bom, acho a progresso de dificuldade meio acentuada mas ainda assim  bem divertido.

However, as you progress, game introduces more words to play with and forces you to think out of box. Understanding how those words  really  work and what you can do with them is the most important element of this game.

It has been a very long time since I had so much fun with a puzzle game.","This game is so quirky and complex, and brain bending in the right ways. If you like puzzle games, you'll love this game, it takes the usual puzzle game fare and proceeds to break your understanding of how games work to create a brain scratcher of a game.Thinking outside of the box is very much encouraged, as you will not just be expected to find the correct sequence to finish a puzzle. It is seldom that simple. You will use word crafting, move planning, and outright ignoring the boundaries of typical video games to do some really satisfying, loopy puzzle solutions. It can be very difficult to wrap your head around the game, even if you are good at thinking unconventionally.If you have a lot of patience and a disposition for exploration of mechanics, this recommendation could not be more in favor of your tastes. For those who lack patience, you will get stuck, you will be left staring at the screen or testing moves for a long time, but the novelty of Baba's puzzles and mechanics are one of a kind as far as I know.I feel the weakest point of Baba is that the video scaling is really poor if you play around with the resolutions too much, everything becomes a blob that melds together in really nasty ways, and ruins the retro 2d aesthetic I tend to enjoy. This game is in sore need of a pixel perfect scaling feature or an easier way to use standardized resolution options that don't make everything look crappy. The music is fairly forgettable too.","is gud","Doge con su orejita volteada","Baba is wow","A very clever and well-designed puzzle game.

I can't stress enough how amazingly well done this game was and how good the game is. The only caveat is that a few levels seem unfairly difficult (Weird mechanics that you had a very low chance of figuring out were possible) but I have only had to look up maybe 5 or so levels out of the whole game.

The art and music are endlessly charming, and the unique concept of changing the game's rules to solve puzzles not only works well in practice, but it has been executed and explored in such detail and with such creativity, it's mind blowing.I've been slowly playing this game for the last eight months, without the use of any guides or hints. When playing this way, Baba Is You ranks up there as one of the most difficult games I've ever played. I have sometimes been stuck on a puzzle for over a month, but when the answer would eventually come to me, it was always very satisfying due to how cleverly this game makes use of its ideas and mechanics. The solution to even the game's most difficult puzzles is always simple, requiring you to become very creative and think way outside the box to discover mechanics and interactions you didn't know the game had. Sometimes I thought I outsmarted the game when I would come up with a strange solution to a puzzle, only to find a later puzzle featuring that same obscure concept.The amount of content in this game is very impressive, with more than 200 puzzles. It will stretch your brain to its absolute limits and then some.I really can't overstate how much I enjoyed this game. It's brilliant beyond all comprehension.

Worth full price if you're into this type of game.Update: 100 levels cleared and finished the \"A Way Out\" level which lets you finish the game without completing the whole game. Very smart decision by the devs to let the player get some sort of closure. The game is hard in the later stages and get be frustrating because of this. It couldn't be fairer though and there's always a solution to the puzzle. I'm not sure I'll continue on beyond this, but if you like logic based puzzle games, this is the one to get.

I would recommend this to literally anyone who enjoys puzzles.Graphics, controls and overall style are simple and functional, with gameplay focused solely on the glorious puzzling. The soundtrack is especially of note, being simple, but strangely compelling.Could expect something between 30-70 hours of playtime to fully complete official levels, depending on ability, and willingness to look up hints\/solutions.","Great puzzle game.

There are bigger games out there. There are AAA titles, but as an atmospheric indie puzzler, Baba is close to flawless. A few puzzles expect you to use mechanics that weren't introduced to you, like in the Prison level, but don't doubt that this is a -very- good game. Especially for the price.Finding solutions in this game can make you wonder if you solved the puzzle in an unintended manner. Did you break the game? Did it glitch? Or is the game simply so well designed, that it constantly stays a step ahead of you?This gives you the feeling of the game designer reading your intentions - and vice versa; a rare and beautiful connection that I haven't felt in a game since Undertale.TL;DR Baba Is Perfect","is GUD as ","Great level design."],["for the bug brainzzz","This is my second favourite game of all time it is such a masterpiece of a game. This may not be very popular but i sure is good for improving on your problem solving skills and its also really cute","Fantastic Puzzles and engaging atmosphere!","Such a simple and yet completely unique and innovative concept. At it's root, Baba Is You is a Sokoban-style block pushing puzzler. The blocks you are pushing are made of text or objects. By repositioning the pieces, you can rewrite the rules of the world. For example, Wall Is Stop can be broken to allow you to walk through walls. While it starts simple, the puzzles quickly become mind-breaking and the creativity the game allows for is incredibly deep. There's very little hand-holding and some of the puzzles are intentionally devious and misleading, so you have to be quick on the uptake and think outside the box. Definitely my favorite puzzle game this year. Every time I think I've reached the end, there are more layers. I'm 40 hours deep in this thing and the meta levels are making my brain hurt.","8.5\/10Gewd puzzle game, do recommendThe soundtrack reminds me of the alan parsons project - I Robot.","BABAISGOOD","Incredibly creative and brain-numbing!

Mightily impressed.","Absolutely mind-blowing puzzle game! Makes me feel stupid for hours until I figure out the puzzle. Then I'm the smartest person in the world......until the next level. Seriously, just get it.","You know those games that start simple and then 5 levels later you're slamming your head against an in-game wall?  And then you wake up at 3am yelling because you've worked it out?  Baba Is You is one of those games.","Baba Is You markets itself as a puzzle game that rewards outside-the-box creative thinking.  In my experience, it mainly rewards persistence.It's a pretty clever puzzle game, where the blocks physical positions also construct the logic of the game world.  That said, the puzzles get really hard fast, and there are no hints and the player is often left to learn new mechanics on their own through trial and error.  As such, this is not a goal-oriented game where the player gets to use their understanding and creativity to plan and execute a solution.  This is a puzzle game with one single solution that can only be found by randomly moving things about until it clicks into place; at which point you experience disappointment and relief, not the thrill of success.It is on the opposite end of the puzzle-game spectrum from Opus Magnum.","One of the most fun and surprising puzzle games in years. A few simple overarching rules are taken to their extremes with every world giving you a new mechanic with bonus levels that stretch those mechanics to their satisfying limit. The graphics and music are minimal and wholly adequate for a game you'll spend dozens of hours looking at and hearing. It's easily one of the best games of the year, let alone puzzle games of the year.","Very cool, thank you Baba.","GA   IS   HA   AND   GOME         RD              OD","bab","Baba is Youisfun","Hard","At time of writing: 31 hours, 4 worlds fully complete, plus some odds and ends. (Overall, a bit over 100 levels cleared.)This is a tricky, brain-bending game - basically a programming challenge in the medium of a top-down block puzzler. Its minimalism in presentation is charming, but it doesn't hold your hand - it really wants you to get crazy and out there with puzzle solutions. It takes almost no time at all to ramp up and start stumping, so if you get frustrated easily, this is a harder sell.Conveniently, everything is 'turn' based (nothing else moves unless you make a directional keypress or a 'pass') so that you can rewind the puzzle at any time, step-by-step, if you feel you've made a critical mistake. Either way, little replicates the feeling one gets when they bring You on top of the object to Win - this is a must-play for puzzle\/programming fans.","big brain","This is like sokoban but instead of the boxes you move conceptions.Play this if you like challenging puzzles!Very simple but brilliant game.Difficulty increase very fast thought.","G  B  ","Really cool and innovative type of puzzle game!

The main concept is simple: Push text around to create statements like \"Rock is push\" or \"Flag is Win\". Each of these Statements immediately change the rules of the game.But it`s not as simple as it sounds, because you can have thousands of word combinations and most levels only have one solution. This is due to the fact that some words are unreachable and the design of the levels is great, because there is never a simple solution and you sometimes have to learn entirely new mechanics to beat a level. The biggest challenge is, changing your way of thinking. For example: You don`t always sink in water and keys are not always used to open doors. You can use keys to open rocks, or have water floating, you can have boxes that contain more boxes, you can transform all stars into flags, you can have grass moving by itself, or you can even control a wall. The possibilities in this game are endless and there is so much thought put into the mechanics of this game. I`m not really good at puzzle games, but I still had a lot of fun with this game. Sometimes it takes a very long time to beat a level, but if you have finally done it, you feel amazing, trust me. The game is not very expensive and a gem of 2019, so I would recommend buying this game, as long as you don`t totally hate puzzle games.","I haven't played this game in a bit and my brain still hurts","This game looks amazing, is fun (to an extent) and has a great soundtrack, however I found a massive problem with this game was how unintuitive it felt to play. I have been having the same problem as many other people who have left negative reviews of this game. I know I am not the smartest but I often enjoy a puzzle for it's challenge and learning how each mechanic works ON MY OWN. The game begins well and it feels great to figure out how to complete the puzzle...however there comes a point where the logic you have gathered in the first few levels is not nearly enough to progress through the later puzzles. I ended up going to walkthroughs for nearly all of the puzzles after a certain point which was frustrating and spoiled the fun. On top of that the levels that I got stuck on often had mechanics that I was never introduced to in the first place and so going to a walkthrough for a solution only made me annoyed as it was somehow something I was meant to figure out. I wish that there was less of a difficulty spike and a more intuitive way to learn the mechanics because then I could have actually had fun with this game.I played this for a bit more than 3 hours so can't get a refund anymore (I think) but if I could get a refund I definitely would. It's not worth the money given that the only way I can get through this game is if the walkthrough essentially plays it for me.","Outstandingly innovative puzzle solving that introduces new mechanics to keep things interesting while maintaining its difficulty and entertainment value. Great game.","Really fun and really hard!","Very creative puzzles, distinctive artstyle and nice music all make this one of the best puzzle games I have recently played.","An innovative, lateral thinking puzzle game that will engage your mental aptitudes and keep you occupied for hours. Dont be intimidated by the ever-growing difficulty, as you have as much time as you like to solve each stage, and its easy enough to restart a given level from the beginning, or even just take a single step back if you make a wrong move. If you derive a sense of satisfaction from overcoming challenging problems, then this game will leave you feeling quite content indeed! Though the graphics are relatively basic, I would say that this only helps to prevent unnecessary distraction.

A simple, yet extremely open-ended main concept, this game is characterized by rules being as flexible as the world they occupy. Hempuli has created a master-class example of what it means to be a brilliant mechanics designer, taking the idea of text defining rules, and running with it until it hits a logical extreme. This is one of the few games where, despite a complete lack of story, spoilers should be avoided, as the amount of secrets contained in Baba is You are innumerable, incredible, and satisfying to discover.Mentioning this game during a job interview also literally got me an Internship at a AAA company as a mechanics designer, so that's extra points aplenty.","An endearing puzzler which revolves around a simple idea, which still allows for a great amount of depth and complexity.","Game is too God d*** hard.","Why am I so stupid???","This is really a smart piece of work.

And the character is soooo cute : )Playing this game is ... lots of love.","why i bad at this","Outstanding puzzle game.","Incredibly meta and mindwarping game. Got me thinking gor hours on end!","Baba Is You is one of those puzzle games that manages to be both incredibly simple (use the arrow keys to move and push\/pull stuff around) and incredibly complex (you can implement a turing complete computer in it). The game does a good job of introducing new mechanics as they become available, then combines them in increasing creative ways to make a truly challenging puzzler that requires you to constantly change your thought process. The game is completely fair;while you can change the specific rules, each mechanic always works the same. Ultimately, Baba Is You is for anyone who wants a challenging puzzler that will make you feel like a genius with (almost) every \"Congratulations!\" you get.","This is a great puzzle game where you move blocks around a screen to program the world around you.

Some are incredibly difficult and others are easy to solve from looking from afar.","Baba Is You is a game with mechanics that are easy to understand and yet can make some of the most complicated puzzles in all of gaming. The style is simple, almost childish, and yet adds to the aesthetic of the game in such a way that any other style simply would not have fit. The way puzzles can be solved is hardly ever linear, allowing for creative ways to progress through the levels and to get to the end of the game. While I have yet to solve every puzzle, I cannot wait to do so.9\/10","I have never played a game that strips down how puzzle games work. It's rare to see games that take one single idea and the exploit the hell out of them to the point where they are no longer the same type of puzzle.

It's a block pushing puzzle game mixed with a healthy serving of programming logic shenanigans. Some levels require you to truly think out of the box to solve, and it's absolutely worth however much you need to pay to get it. =D","Absolutely amazing! Each and every new world comes with new behaviors which surprise you more than the last. Many of the levels will result in hours and hours of head scratching, but nothing feels as good as finally figuring out the solution after tinkering for so long. The game mechanics are already clever by themselves, but even more when combined with one another, which most of the time results in really interesting, unexpected, surprising - and sometimes bizarre - interactions. The only problem in this game seems to be with the difficulty curve - without any sort of hint system, you're sometimes clueless as to how to apply the mechanics you've learned in order to solve the problem presented by the level. Although, this won't be a problem if you like challenges - what I've noticed is just that, later in the game, it could get a bit overwhelming to be stuck in dozens of levels at once. This, however, is compensated by the vast amount of guides and discussion threads on Steam, which are available in many levels of \"help\" - whether you want to get the solution right away, or just a subtle hint to help you figure out the answer by yourself.In general, it's a really good game that managed to achieve one of the hardest things to accomplish: to combine a great concept with a great execution. If you're the type of player that likes puzzle games, this one should definitely be in your list!","very creative and fun game","Cute visual style for a puzzle game. Incredibly creative in it's puzzle design and forces you to think. Very nice level progression. High recommend.","The game uses slide puzzles as a disorienting canvas for some really difficult sequential logic problems. I'm not certain if I'd directly recommend Baba is You, but I'll certainly commend it for its creativity and for how efficiently it scrambled my brain. The sharp build-up in those first few segments of stages told my lack of patience that I wouldn't stand a chance against the rest of the game. I'd suggest grabbing the game for a lighter price on a portable platform like the Switch. Playing at home on a desktop for longer sessions makes it difficult to focus and there are always walkthroughs too temptingly nearby.","10\/10 Finally a puzzle game that puzzles me.","Good game but I'm terrible at it.","Me Is Fan of puzzle gamesBaba Is You Is Unlike any other puzzle game I've played         Is   Amazing","A cunning puzzle game that redefines the rules.

But once the game leads you into realising a few of its tricks (namely, that you can link multiple '[Noun] is [Adjective]' statements via the starting noun or finishing adjective, and also that you can use '[Noun] is [Noun]' statements too) the game opens up in a way Snakebird never could.I fully expect this game to get VERY hard very quickly, many reviews call this game damn hard.

Amazing! :)","So fun but brain hurt","Baba is You is the best puzzle game I ever played right after The Witness.

Rarely are puzzle games this challenging for me.","to top que eu fico preso mas no consigo desistir","Baba is you, is a great puzzle game that challenges you to think outside the box.","When I first played this game, the mechanics blew my mind. Later in the game, you'll need to make sure that you have a solid understanding of each mechanic because the levels get very difficult. But the feeling of solving a level that you've been stuck on for a bit just feels amazing. Seriously, the level design and the solutions to the levels are just insanely good.","When I was buying the game I was afraid of the level design. But I must admit that the level design is great (at least for me). Mostly the solution is short (just a few moves) but difficult to find out. And that means that you can solve the levels quite very quickly and the only thing that slows you down is your brain (and not the amount of moves).","A clever puzzle game with simple rules. Despite the fact that the moves don't seem to change, each puzzle seems to add a new layer and require a new way of thinking. Often a solution requires taking a step back and coming to it fresh from a whole new direction.","Here's a game that will frustrate you and then make you feel clever. The basic mechanic gets exploited for all its worth in brilliant, unexpected and often chaotic ways. Puzzles get pretty difficult pretty fast, but be patient and try your best. You won't be disappointed.","It can be quite hard, even from the start. Still, the concept is very good and the game is enjoyable.","Probably the most innovative game to in sequence make me feel dumb and then smart, and repeats until I just feel dumb at a puzzle I can't make sense of.","This game bends my mind in strange new ways. I feel that I'm a better person for playing it.","Literal word play","Before playing:I'm good at puzzle games, bring it on!After playing:ME IS STUPID AND BRAIN IS BROKEN","Baba Is You is an amazing puzzle game. At first it seems simple but a few levels in, the walls don't stop you, you are the wall, the wall isn't even a wall anymore. Baba can be quite challenging on the brain, with all the possible combinations of rules and interactions that derive from those rules, but I'd give it a try if I were you. There are many guides both online and on steam that offer hints to the levels but don't spoil them entirely. Spoilers: When you reach Overworld Level-9 you unlock the noun LEVEL, which adds to the complexity of the game, where the map itself is a level. I found this part of the game mind-blowing. The fact that the island I was playing on this whole time was a level?! It's incredible. Also, there is a level editor, where you can play fan-made levels (most of them being harder than the main game) and develop your own. The level editor even includes words that aren't used in the base game. Baba gets a 10\/10 from me, great puzzles, cute sprites, amazing fanbase. Highly recommend.","I wish I could describe this game with another game, but I can't. It faintly reminds me of a card game where the winning condition is random, same as the rules and both change as you play.","Very fun and difficult. Fun with friends. :thumbsup:","Mind-bendingly awesome","Hard, need brain so I can't beat.","This game is super cool!

And Baba would buy Baba is you. So you'll buy Baba is you.Now.","One of the most creative puzzle games i have played in a long time","good game","Follow our Curator Group for more reviewsBaba Is You is a 2D puzzle game focusing around word\/phrase puzzles specifically. There are sometimes other elements to each puzzle, but the core of the game is about combining words into phrases in order to change the rules of that puzzle. For example, you might have the words Baba, Flag, Win, Is, Wall, Stop, and You. Usually, Flag is Win starts out as a default rule that cant be changed, but sometimes it isnt. You could solve the puzzle by saying Wall is Win, then bumping into the wall to complete the level. You could also remove the word Stop from Wall is Stop, which would allow you to walk through the wall and touch the flag to win. There is a huge amount of possibilities thanks to this open-ended system, which does wonders to keep the game interesting and varied.The game starts off slow, but quickly ramps up the difficulty and complexity. Some puzzles have challenge versions, in which the obvious solution is no longer possible and you need to think of a new strategy. This is done by making slight changes to an existing puzzle that seem relatively minor, but wind up forcing you to think outside the box. It shows off how talented the developers are, to be able to create the same puzzle twice but with wildly different solutions.Aside from puzzles, there really isnt anything else in this game. There isnt a narrative like Portal, instead the game focuses all of its energy on puzzle design. For some people, this can make the game a little one-dimensional, but for hardcore puzzle fans, it gives you a huge challenge and doesnt hold your hand as you play.Baba Is You is one of the most well crafted puzzle games of all time, easily earning its stellar review score and all the praise it has received.10\/10Visit our website for more in-depth reviews and recommendations","It's good, but hard.

Its very charming and fun. There are different ways to solve each level and worth a buy in my books.","Great mind-bending puzzler.  You'll be incredibly frustrated until you figure out the correct solution.  Then, you'll smack yourself in the forehead for missing the obvious.","Baba is hotBaba is coolBaba is loveBaba is you","One might expect a puzzle game where the player has control over the rules to be extremely easy.  Indeed, as a computer science major myself, I consider myself to have critical thinking and algorithmic problem-solving skills well above the average.  And yet, Baba is You is a game that regularly makes me feel like an idiot.The game starts simple, of course, but it rapidly becomes more and more complex.  As the player progresses, the new rules they can create become more and more high-level and abstract, to such a point where even experimenting with different combinations of rules while circumnavigating the constraints of the level is a daunting challenge.And yet, it never becomes frustrating.  Between its subdued, bassy soundtrack and its wibbly-lined, childlike art style, Baba manages to maintain a very lax atmosphere (Not to mention offset the existential horror of turning sapient beings into rocks and keys, or accidentally forming the extremely nihilistic rule, \"ALL IS EMPTY\").  All-in-all, it's a very pure puzzle game, and one I would describe as surprisingly cozy.  On a rainy day where you don't really feel like going out, it might be wise to boot up Baba and spend a little bit of time thinking about those levels you've been stuck on for a whilethe solution may come to you when you least expect it.Nine Babas out of Ten","One of the more interesting puzzle games out there, even with only three hours clocked in I can see why people enjoy this game so much.

You can only move up\/down\/left\/right or wait for a turn, allowing any object that IS MOVE to take a single step forward; There is no \"interact\" button. A set of Words on every stage can be pushed (like boxes in traditional block-pushing games) to create Rules which then apply universally to everything in the level. No objects have any inherent meaning; A wall will only become solid if \"WALL IS STOP\" is written, either horizontally or vertically, somewhere in the level.There are ten worlds in the game, most of which introduce one new concept and use it throughout (later worlds occasionally have multiple concepts, which are explored in isolated subsections). The game does a very good job at the setpiece\/antepiece relationship; The early levels in any given world will usually be straightforward puzzles, steadily growing more complex, allowing you to ease into a concept without needing it to be explicitly described to you.Predictably, some of the later worlds can be ruthlessly difficult as concepts are blended together and reused in clever ways. Almost no two puzzles are alike; It feels like every level has a distinct solution from the rest, to the game's benefit. However, I'd advise not looking up details about the game before playing; There may be a few surprising secrets that you want to wait and see aboutHighly recommended. The game looks simple for $15, but there's far more than enough content for it to be worth it if you like unusual puzzlers.","BABA IS YOUISGAME IS GOOD","GAME IS GOOD","What I liked:   A true brain teaser from start to finish  The most simple and yet hardest puzzles ever created Unique puzzle mechanicsWhat I didnt like:   Some rules arent ever explained and meant to be figured out by trial and errorMy Score: A++Quick Summary Overall this game is another instant puzzle classic that given its simple looking nature is so much harder than I bet most will expect and will be loved by any puzzle fan without a doubt. Dont let it being a text based puzzle game scare you away from this gem.More in depth:  I love a good puzzle game, with years between getting anything good. This one was worth the long gap.  The game starts out with simple move text around to solve word problems tied to gameplay mechanics. Its way funnier than it sounds, and it never gets boring 20 hours in. Let that sink in, you get 20 hours of brain teasing puzzles. Most puzzle games either run out of ideas\/content half way to that point. If that doesnt get you hard, you must not like puzzle games.   You get rules that you cant manipulate, like touching a skull will kill you, with a skull directly blocking your only way forward, with other rules to let you know what you cant do. Because if it doesnt say you cant do it, you can do it. Like a simple making you two different objects and using one to suicide to make a path for you in one of them. Figuring out the solution is half the battle, as actually doing it is also hard.My only issue was that I need to look up a handful of solutions because they do very little to teach you, you learn through doing. A spoiler and an example is I didnt know you can overlap words to have both be applied. But once you learn the few ideas, you wont need to look up any help, unless you cant solve one and spend way too long and then find out it was really simple and you feel stupid.

But where the innovation comes is that instead of random crates filled with nothing you are pushing around logical words and their representations. A box BABA, the logic word, is tied to the sheep. Connected with the IS word and YOU, any and all sheep on the screen becomes a player character that takes the same commands at the same time.Puzzle complexity is NOT for the casual audience, but at the same time it gets gradually more difficult to allow experimentation and learning. You can reset any puzzle anytime you want, and you can move 1 step backwards all the way back to the beginning in case you realize that you've screwed something up somewhere in between.What must be said though is that the cute visual style and relaxed ambience sounds are top notch and fit perfectly the puzzle-solving mood. You can always mute it if you get tired of the sounds, too. Personally, I haven't completed the game yet: I take my time, every once in a while firing the game to solve yet another abstract box-pushing puzzle.

It is uncompromisingly logical, and you'll be a good way through the game before you get a complete grasp of how the main mechanics even work, for instance, the game logic's total reliance on turns (e.g. waiting). I'm currently thinking of the level 'Tour', where you need to know that any transformations do not occur immediately, but are queued for the end of the turn. This means that any rules which are opposites, such as Baba is Keke with Keke is Baba, the effect is a flip flop each turn. Look up a walkthrough for this level to know what I mean.That sounds bad, but the truth is that almost every level acts as a tutorial where you can experiment and derive the necessary information. The few many times I did look up a solution (hey, I didn't say I was any good), I immediately understood why it worked, subsequently felt a little stupid, and felt that with more experimentation, I would've figured it out. And of course, the game is designed to teach you its mechanics in manageable pieces.TL;DR This game is ruthlessly logical and I love it for that.","This game gives me big brain.","Baba is good","Baba is YouLove is BabaGame is Good","GA IS BEME     ST","To all appearances simple, this puzzle game becomes engaging and satisfying.","Wonderful, perfect gem of a game","hella puzzles hella headaches great game 10\/10","BABA IS FUNISGOOD"," is me is level is brain10\/10","Brain is confusedGame is best","good puzzle game.

A lot of \"puzzles\" actually require you to utilize \"intentional glitches\" which circumvent the normal collision detection programming.  What do I mean by \"intentional glitches\"?  Ever play Super Mario Maker?  Ever play a level where mario is in the MIDDLE of a bunch of bricks and you have to expertly move around INSIDE the collision area of the bricks to reach the flag, but if you accidentally touch the edge of a brick you get soft locked?YEAH - THAT KIND OF NONSENSE IS IN HERE!What makes it even more frustrating is if you don't think about abusing glitches.  I hate abusing glitches so I never liked doing those levels in SMM.  Well, THAT STUFF IS ALL OVER THIS GAME AT THE HIGHER LEVELS!  To top it off you have to INNATELY UNDERSTAND HOW TO GLITCH THE GAME because there are NO EXPLANATIONS on how to abuse these glitches.It's frustrating as hell.2.

Just the simple idea of \"changing the rules of the game\" is such an innovative concept, but the way Baba pulls it off is simply amazing.Almost every stage in the game features an unique and difficult challenge where you have to think outside the box and play around with the rules a lot, and the way all the objects interact with each other just makes this one of my favorite games of all time.Although, every game has it's problems. In my opinion, some of the levels suffer from kinda bad planning, even if it's only ~1\/20 levels, it's still there. And even the \"final\" level suffers from it, which made the level annoying to figure out. Some levels just require something way too specific to be fun to figure out how to beat. Some levels have a good challenge on figuring out what to do, but their setup makes it annoying to execute the idea. And some levels, like the \"final\" one, suffer from having too many rules, which makes the level look way more complicated than it actually is.Overall, I'd definitely recommend this game, although you have to be careful, this game is definitely not for everyone.","Game is good","Really gets you thinking","Baba is Good. Get really  hard real quick so it's no easy puzzler either","Baba is rad!This game has a lot of clever puzzles, and creative mechanics, that are explored to their full potential! Although a few silly inconsistencies, paradoxes, and gimmicky mechanics, left me incredibly infuriated. When I looked up the solution, it felt like it wasn't even my fault. For example in level Island 12 - Evaporating River, it just doesn't make any logical sense that a cog would sink a skull. It just left me annoyed instead of making making me go ahah, that's pretty smart! A simple name change from Sink to Bomb or something, would have made the premise a lot easier to understand.Don't let those few anomalies put you off the game though, just play it with a grain of salt. An otherwise exceptionally fantastic game, festooned with innovation, left a small bitter taste in my mouth.","Is good and hard.

The art and music is beautifully simple and adorable which contrasts with how complex the puzzles get. The game is perfectly paced as the games starts simple with core mechanics and each area gives you new words to work with that add new properties constantly spicing up the puzzles once the old ones start to get stale. It forces you to always think outside the box since the most obvious answer usually is not correct, and it is so satisfying figuring out solutions to each puzzle because of this. The late game levels also push boundaries in such clever ways that most puzzle games don't touch, but it makes so much sense with the rules the game sets up. If there's one thing I can fault the game on, it is that some of the mechanics can be hard to interpret at times with how many interactions there are, but figuring them out is also part of the fun. Sometimes it is just as fun to play around with the logic since you can basically do anything the rules allow, so even if it doesn't lead to a solution, some fun things can still happen.In summary, the only way Baba would have:\"BABA IS YOU\" HAS FUNISBESTANDHARD"],["it good","baba is baba","One of the most satisfyingly difficult puzzle games I have ever played.

For puzzle lovers.","If you like puzzles then Baba is 100% right for you!","I fell in love with the concept of Baba is You the moment I saw it.This is by far one of the most original an ingenious idea for a puzzle game I have ever seen. What a breath of fresh air!Don't let it fool you, it's not just a clever concept. The guy who made this game pushed the mechanics to their limit. Everytime you will think you mastered the rules, the game will throw in a new one at you.In essence, Baba is You is a game where you have to bend the rules to solve the puzzles. It starts off pretty simple but it gets insanely complex FAST. I consider myself a pretty logical person, I'm usually good at solving puzzles. This game consistently made me feel STUPID.You will definitely have those \"Ah-ah!\" moments with a lot of the puzzles you solve. There is however a point where certain solutions just feel... Tedious. Solutions that will take a long time to set up, where you're not entirely sure you're doing the right thing and are left with somewhat of a bitter taste when it ends up working.I freaking loved this game. But to my own detriment; I am a completionist of sorts. I went from loving the game to just... Wanting to be done with it. I remained stuck on some earlier levels having no idea what to do and didn't progress for a long time.I found two things that helped a TON in completing the whole game, 100%:1. Look for hints online when you're truly stuck. Do NOT look for solutions, that's the whole point of the game. If you can't solve it, you probably won't be able to solve the next one either. However, sometimes you just need a gentle nudge in the right direction and that's nothing to be ashamed of.2. Consider playing with someone. I turned Baba is You into a co-op game around the 4th world. I never had such a good example of the saying \"Two heads are better than one\". I played through the majority of the game with a friend of mine who's also very logical and it was mind-blowing how differently we solved each puzzles! There where some puzzles I'd solve instantly that he would take a long time to solve and some other puzzles that would leave me completely clueless while he was able to figure them out very quickly.Even still, the later portion of the game got the better of us. It felt sadistic. We were often at our wits' end and just wanted to be done with the game we once loved so much.This game is amazing... But beware! It is unforgivingly difficult and you are much better off playing it in smaller doses. I don't feel like we wasted much time and it took me 60 hours to beat... I expected less than 10.All in all, it's very worth it! Even if you only play through the first world or two.","this game is mind boggling, funny, and quite stupid (in the good way) :)","Game is amazing. ---{Graphics}--- You forget what reality is Beautiful Good Decent Bad Dont look too long at it Paint.exe---{Gameplay}--- Addictive like heroin Excellent Good Its just gameplay Mehh Staring at walls is better---{Audio}--- Eargasm Very good Good Not too bad Bad Earrape---{Audience}--- Kids Teens Adults Human---{PC Requirements}--- Check if you can run paint Potato Decent Fast Hefty PC Ask NASA if they have a spare computer---{Difficulty}--- Just press 'W Easy Significant brain usage Easy to learn \/ Hard to master Difficult Dark Souls---{Grind}--- Nothing to grind Only if u care about leaderboards\/ranks Isn't necessary to progress Average grind level Too much grind Youll need a second life for grinding---{Story}--- Story?

Plus, the puzzles that introduce new mechanics are challenging in their own right -- and the difficulty only ramps up from there.

Baba Is You is one of my top favorite games of 2019 and possibly the most innovative game of 2019 only being matched by Slay The Spire.","puzzle game that's got a unique spin and is appropriately difficult(i only ever really got super stuck on how to do a few levels and had to look them up)There were a few times where there was something you needed to do that had zero indication it was possible (stacking text onto each other being one), but otherwise i enjoyed every minute!","Baba is hard","Creative, well designed puzzles, out of the box (perhaps even literally) thinking.","Baba is you. For the first few levels anyways. Soon, you might be a bug, or Keke, or even some water. Baba is You is one of the best puzzle games I've played. It's got some real tough ones, but worst comes to worst, there are guides for the levels online. Definitely worth picking up. Also, remember, nothing is inherently anything!","Turns my brain inside out","The late game gets incredibly restrictive and it ultimately comes down to solving things in the exact sequence the dev came up with, which is disappointing given the premise and the freedom allowed by the early levels that can have as many as five solutions. It's clear that the dev had no idea how to juggle increased complexity along with player freedom as time went on, so what we got instead were simpler levels with arbitrary limitations. Add to that the game's complete inability to explain the tools at your disposal, and you're going to end up solving levels by mistake or looking up the solution only to discover you weren't even aware you could perform the action you were required to do.If you're up for untangling Baba's idiosyncrasy, then you might find this rewarding. But as a puzzle? It's eons away from even coming close to a title like Talos Principle, let alone rival it or outdo it.","I'm so smart i'm so dumb i'm so  smart wow how am i this stupid i am a  GENIUS","The best praise that I can give this game is that is scratches a puzzle itch like no over. Few games (such as portal) can do that for me but Baba is you is truly the most unique.Baring one puzzle with a method the game doesn't tell you, every puzzle is solvable without the need to look up a guide and easily done so provided you can stick by the games one requirement. You can't just think outside the box you have to be the box(quite literally sometimes), think next to the box and think like that one guy who said\" wow thats a nice looking box\".  My point its very rewarding to solve a puzzle and when it just clicks is the truly the best reward, similar to beating a hard boss.  The phrase innovative gets thrown around a lot right now but this game is actually worthy of that definition","Great game, good design.","Its such a well made puzzle gmae if you understand it","BABAISGOOD","good game","In an FPS, you click and you shoot.

Seriously, it is worth triple its asking price","I have been a fan of puzzle games for my entire life. I LOVE a challenge. The problem with many puzzle games of this day and age is that most have fallen into a very specific category with a rote formula. You have the classic \"escape game\" of \"get x object to do this thing, find code, walk out door.\" You have number and math puzzles galore. You have physics puzzles, where you have to get something to fall JUST the right way. Wash, rinse, repeat. Don't get me wrong, these games all have their special place in my heart, and I do still enjoy them from time to time. But then there came Baba is You.Baba is You does something that I had long given up hope of a game ever doing again. Baba is You has created an ENTIRELY new concept of puzzle. Unique, challenging, but with a simple-to-learn concept, BIY is something completely different. It bends the very idea of the reality of a game, twisting traditional gaming on it's head. All the while, still presenting the same EXACT goal of practically ANY game: Get [YOU] to [WIN]. In so doing, Baba is You has created something precious, and reminded us that there are always new ideas out there in the gaming universe, you just have to find them.10\/10, A masterpiece of simplicity.","BabaIsYou is Win","baba is fun","amazing puzzle game, best game of the year","Incredibly unique game, great puzzles, have told multiple friends to buy it as well!","Fun","Totally unique puzzle game.Very clever.Very challenging.Utterly brilliant.","baba is good","Best puzzle game since Portal.","Baba Is You is unique. It merges programming puzzles perfectly with sokoban gameplay, and uses it's rule manipulation premise in so many fun and unexpected ways.

Baba Is You feels functionally similar to that game - essentially a sliding-block programming simulator - except the person hanging out with me is a cute girl who idly doodles pictures in crayon while I'm thinking, instead of laughing at me. Maybe this comes down to a deeply ingrained inferiority complex; maybe it's purely about knowledge communicated to the player and visual style; but maybe that's enough: one of these games I will never play again, and the other, I will eagerly recommend to my friends.","I'm so confused, but in a good way","Creative, mind bending puzzles.

The manner in which the game unfolds in front of you is a sight to behold.  Each level uses what you have already learned and adds to it in ways that you will not always see right away.  Many times, you will bash your head into a level attempting to use what you are sure is the solution, only to realize 30 minutes later that you were going about it all wrong.  Once you have this \"A-Ha\" moment, you will likely complete the level in seconds.Baba Is You should be played by any one who enjoys puzzle games, and can be enjoyed by any one.  To achieve the greatest amount of joy from this game, I would highly recommend that you avoid guides at all costs.  Using a guide will make this game trivial and you will miss out on some of the greatest feelings of accomplishment you can get.

And then sometimes it follows that up with a new version of the puzzle that's almost identical, but with a key element removed, which means you have to find some wholly other way to accomplish the same thing that already seemed impossible the first time.Might be my new favorite puzzle game that isn't Portal.","good game","Great premise for a game but the puzzles can get really difficult quite quickly.

I went in expecting a funny little diversion, and instead I got an expansive and humbling existential trip.Between the puzzles that rely on quirks of the behavioural engine and the quickly-rising complexity, Baba Is You can be shockingly difficult.

If you want to see what is possible within this game then you should buy it right now. However the level design is clumsy - you'd be tempted to imagine a game about breaking rules and exploring possibilities, but in practice it feels like the designer is trying so hard to outsmart you, to make sure that all the puzzles are virtually single solution, that two things happen:1. It takes a lot of mental effort just to work out which parts of the level are relevant and which parts are just blocking your exploits2. Most of your time spent playing involves discovering genuinely creative near-solutions, immediately followed by the anticlimax of one of those exploit-blocking obstacles. You effectively need to 'solve' a puzzle 3 or 4 times just to find the solution that the designer will allow you to use.Genius mechanics, and a great medium for learning what can be done with them, but a very unsatisfying puzzle game.","It's amazing.","baba is good","There are so many ways to reflect on this game -- linguistic, philosophical, programming, what have you.

(Translation: This game is amazingly challenging, but once you figure out the puzzle, it seems so damn simple, you want to kick yourself for not seeing it right away. It's also one of those puzzle games where you go to the bathroom\/shower and somehow the answer just appears before you, usually in the way of saying \"What, can I Do that?!\"Sure, you COULD cheat and see the solution online.

Loved coming back to a puzzle later with fresh eyes and getting it. The journey is often worth more than the destination, and what you find along the way will surprise and amuse you. Lots to play here so even when you do have to leave a puzzle for later there will always be more to do. The game is pretty good at teaching its mechanics by scaling up difficulty, though every once in a while you'll need to think in a completely different direction than you think, which can be frustrating at first (though ultimately rewarding when you do get it later)Best played without a strategy guide, or at least one that starts with hints before giving away the solution.","this game gave me a brain aneurysm","Game of the year, Its been a while since I've  been surprised by new game mechanics, this game has a lot of innovation on its core mechanics plus some of the levels design are amazing, I hope the team who made this game continue with this path. 10\/10","I don't normally play puzzle games, but this one has really resonated with me. This game presents logic puzzles based not on just following the rules, but also learning exactly what they mean, so you can bend them to achieve your goal. I'm 5 hours in with two fully completed islands. Some puzzles are trivial and you can solve many in a row, but I'm running into more and more puzzles that take me a single session to figure out.

The game is very simple you will (mostly) start playing as a cute creature called Baba and trapped in the room with other object like \"Rock\", \"Key\", \"flag\" etc. and the text like \"Baba is you\" that means you controlling Baba with other text like \"Rock is push\" so rocks can be pushed and the text \"Win\" you can push the texts to make new rules by combination other texts to change the rule like making \"Rock is win\" and you just simply walk into any rocks in the room to beat the level.Sound simple but some levels are insanely challenging and creative sometime you just have to think outside the box.In conclusion     this game is hand drawn art style puzzle that you can change the rule by make new combination of words. its creative and original puzzle game, Its surprisingly hard than you think but fun to solve. also have a good soundtracks too!","imo very original puzzle game,","Wow, this guy is a great game.","The game starts strong with possibilities and multiple ways of solving each room. Unfortunately it quickly devolves into tightly  designed puzzles with no solutions outside of the intended.

It gets hard at times, and you'll be really tempted to search up answers sometimes: but all in all each level teaches you something new about the game or tests you on your knowledge of the game's logic or mechanics.

There is nearly infinite potential for expansion and the modding community is brimming with extra content. Just to warn this game seems simple but it quickly becomes difficult and requires out-of-the-box thinking, and this game is not all that it seems. ANYTHING you tell the game to do with its own rules, it can do.","I generally consider myself to be quite good at lateral thinking.  But this game has me doubting myself.Baba Is You is a fantastic turn-based puzzler, with a very interesting mechanic.  The rules for each level are dynamic, entirely determined by the \"sentences\" written out in text on the game board.  For example, the eponymous sentence \"Baba Is You\" allows the player (You) to control the sheep character (\"Baba\") on the game board.  By moving your character, you can push into words on the board to rearrange them, thus forming new sets of rules in order to beat the level.  10\/10 would definitely recommend.","Nice open-ended puzzle solving. Answer always feels personal, unlike most puzzle games where it just feels like you figured out what the dev wanted you to do.Game is Good.","It's a super clever game that forces you to think outside the box to solve its puzzles.

Totally worth the price too!","Great logic puzzle game that makes you think in ways you normally don't.","baba is fr*ckin sweet............","If you're looking for a unique and challenging puzzle game, you're definitely gonna have to check this game out!The concept of Baba Is You is actually quite simple, within each level the rules of the level is constructed from  words that appear as moveable items. Move the words around to create new rules to your advantage to finish the level. For example if the words BABA IS YOU appear beside each other you play as the character Baba, but if you were to move around the words to say ROCK IS YOU you would instead begin to play as the rock (or rocks) in the level. If some words says FLAG IS WIN you win when you reach the flag, move them to say WATER IS WIN and you win when you reach the water, and so on. While the idea is simple the levels in Baba Is You are generally very well designed and vary in difficulty from a few minutes of pondering to several hours of head scratching.Throughout each new World in the game you also get introduced to a surprinsingly big amount of new concepts and rules (words) that constantly have you rethink how the game is supposed to be played.I very much recommend this game but bear in mind: This game is VERY challenging. You will certainly make it through the first levels without much trouble but sooner or later the game will show its real face to you. If that seems like your thing, go ahead and buy it!","GAME IS META","Baba is you stands as one of the most intelligent, original, and clever games I have ever played.

It played with my expectations expertly, led me to incredible leaps of lateral thinking, and contains the most astonishing \"a-HA!\" moments I've experienced in a videogame. Please, for the love of God, try and play it without walkthroughs, hints, or spoilers; discovering the nuances of the game's grammar and really fully loading its rules into your skull is something that has to be done yourself. The overall experience is *transcendent.* I give it a very large number out of 10.","it good","very intriguing, fun, and a great game overall.","Extremely clever","[Overview]So Sokoban went home one day to his wife, Programming Game, one day. Later, their child was born. It was unpolished and only had 14 levels, but the concept was so intriguing that it won the game jam it participated in and grew up nice and strong to be a fully, fledged steam game and \"Game of the Month\". Why did it win? How did the game become so popular? Well, to find out, just create the words GOLDUDE is EXPLAIN.[Gameplay]No, I wasn't kidding when I likened this game as a lovechild of programming games and Sokoban. Let me give you a great example: In the tutorial level, you have four things to go on\" WALL is STOP, ROCK is PUSH, BABA is YOU, FLAG is WIN. You may think that's only four elements, but it's actually NINE. WALL can be pushed to make WALL is YOU, Rock can be pushed into ROCK is WIN, Baba can be pushed into BABA is PUSH, etc etc etc and the game will react accordingly with you controlling the walls, able to push Baba anywhere, and running into the wall in order to beat the level.As you can see, this game can get very complicated very quickly, but new words and objects don't get introduced too quickly. You won't be making statements like ROCK NEAR BABA IS SINK AND HAS KEY while making sure the KEY is KEY so the key doesn't change into lava because there's rules stating KEY is LAVA AND DEFEAT and LAVA IS MORE. There gets to be so many objects and words that a few gimmick levels snuck in which made me go \"OOOOOO THATS SO COOL\" multiple times.But... there is a HUGE downside. Unless you don't want to rack up 80 hours played with the vast majority of your time being taken up by you staring at the screen with a slowly dripping stream of drool coming out of your mouth like you're some second-grader trying to instantly learn trigonometry, I highly suggest you push PRIDE into IS NOT HERE and actually ask people for hints. Why do I say this? The pacing is absolutely terrible. You could breeze through two levels in a total of under 25 seconds, then be stuck at the next three for HOURS (You heard me, HOURS. And I mean hours PER LEVEL). Then, once you finally solve those three levels, the next level takes you 10 minutes to solve, the next one 25 seconds, the next two a combined total of 1 hour 45 minutes, the next level 40 seconds.Baba is You is very good at not teaching you the \"tricks\"\/\"techniques\" you need to use in order to solve a good number of the levels in the game. Seriously, There's a lot of moments where I had to look up hints, still be confused, finally have to look up the solution in a video, see the solution, and go \"I WOULD NEVER HAVE EVER (_EVER_) THOUGHT TO DO THE THING REQUIRED IN ORDER TO BEAT THE LEVEL!\" You get taught the function of the words, yes, but that really isn't enough.And stop calling this game \"The Dark Souls of Puzzle Games\". It isn't. You've never even played Dark Souls. Just because a game is difficult doesn't mean it's ****ing Dark Souls.[Music & Sounds]The sounds perform exactly as they need to, with each different sound being memorable, from the \"dull\" movement sound to the dings indicating that a new rule has been established, to the white noise representing something being defeated\/melted\/broken\/whatever. The water splash sound also sounds like a water splash. There's really not much to say about the sounds other than they do their job.The music, on the other hand... I cannot tell you how many times I found myself going to youtube to listen to some of the songs. They're so catchy. While not as varied and eclectic as games like Killer Instinct and LISA the Painful, the chiptuney soundtrack is always a delight to listen to no matter where you are and what you're doing.[Art]There's... really not much to say about the art. Some of my friends would find it cutsy, but I just say that the art performs exactly what it needs to do. It's clear and coherent, I know what everything is, and I like the \"wiggling\" of all the art. It's not really required of a 2D puzzle game to have art so good that you can barely be able to tell it apart from reality.[Final rating]Gameplay: 8\/10Pacing: 2\/10Music & Sounds: 8\/10Art: 6\/10OVERALL: 6.5\/10Despite my complaints about the pacing, my mind was constantly being filled up with ideas of levels I can make using the soon-to-be-released level editor. Well, that and there were a decent amount of extremely cool ideas that blew my mind. Buy it if you have the money whilst keeping hints and a walkthrough within reach.","Divertido el uso de la logica para resolver cada nivel. Simple y a la vez dificil.","Great puzzle game! Gfx, music and sounds are pretty basic and cute :3 but it's all about thinking out of the box. This is why game itself becomes really hard so quickly. It has everything that player needs: save slots, undo button, basic settings (you can turn animations and music off when i.e. it all makes you dizzy).Money and time very well spent <3","10\/10 Prolog interpreter simulator.","Turning large parts of the level into you is as hype as it sounds.","More interesting reviews on  Fenol Baron Approves Curator Page If you put aside the memes and jokes told about Baba Is You (dont think that people are trying to make you laugh, they are nervously trying to joke with pain and despair), then one thing can be said about this game - its so beautiful that it excites I want to put a tear on my cheek. Being in it is like the contemplation of Durer's drawings and prints, with each new viewing revealing to you their sharp, previously invisible faces; hiding small details behind a monumental general idea, requiring maximum attention and immersion from you. The core of the gameplay is as simple as complex - you have a limited area, a few cubes with words that you can move and connect with each other, several things that obey the rules that you will make of cubes. Win it. And this game is all at once. She is programming, she is Sokoban, she is also a destroyer of rules, she is Baba, and all that can be required from an upscale puzzle game.Get ready for the fact that Baba is your girlfriend or boyfriend with whom you live a very long time, and she knows you. She knows literally everything about you. She knows that you are a self-confident puzzle-breaker and will punish you for it. She knows that after the first victories you will certainly try to apply the successfully derived formula for success in further riddles - and will punish you for that. She will respect you for your growing personal mastery, but will not make any concessions for it. She loves you and hates you, will not let you dictate her own rules, but will allow them to be destroyed, creating something delicious. If I believed in a worldwide conspiracy of pyramid-headed medusians, then I would be sure that this is an experiment on the will of a player who loves puzzles. Each riddle here is like a hymn to the beauty of a pure mind, impeccable elegant logic, the charms of not only the solution itself, but also the ability to change something inside your head in the process of gaining it. This game raises the concept of \"insight\" to some simply inconceivable degree, and it seems to me that it stands here even above the dry rational arrangement of the elements of the puzzle on the shelves. You will feel so many times that you are Archimedes screaming Eureka!, that just in case you will get a full bath of water and try to discover some new law.Of course, the creator has invested incredibly much in this game, and this applies to both external and internal efforts. More than 200 puzzles of the highest quality, each of which can be proud of, a magnificent understanding of human psychology, the constant introduction of some kind of novelty into the game, the game does not stand still. Honestly, give this game a workshop for creating levels, and it will live forever, thanks to the crowds of creators who will make new puzzles. This game is ruthless, it breaks with its complexity, but it's worth it, because you always know that even beyond an infinitely complex riddle there is an elegant solution, you just need to change something in your head. If you like puzzles even minimally, then this game should be taken even without any discounts, since its price is very affordable, for its uniqueness it deserves maximum attention.","Fun and challenging puzzles, innovation at its best. If you like puzzle games, this one is definitely for you.","Fun mind twisting game.  No performance issues that I saw, and lots of content.  Puzzles are creative and not a slog.  No plot though, sadly.  Game is worth the price, imo.","Another good gem.","Really good video game but I'm too dumb to figure out the puzzles","Best puzzle game ever","First off I really do like the concept of this game, it starts off really well and has quite a few good moments, but it has some issues.1. Maybe its just me, but the difficulty spikes way too quickly. World 1 wasn't an issue, world 2 was a bit more complex. But a few more worlds in and it just got way too complicated. For the record I beat Portal 2 and only got stuck once or twice so I wouldn't say I'm bad at puzzle games. (Steam's achievements show the player drop off rate as the levels go on quite well)2. The creator *really* likes to update existing levels. Occasionally its because a level was too hard so he made an easy version and made the original an \"extra\" level or maybe there was something that gave the player an idea of a false solution. But 95% of the time the changes he makes either make it more complicated for no reason or remove an alternative, although clever, solution. In worlds 5+ I'm getting stuck on every second level, but I don't want to just search the exact answer, so I've used hint guides when I need them. But now they're all outdated because of the level changes and therefore the hints often aren't useful anymore. This also applies to the solution videos on YouTube (Thank god for comments describing the new solution). I get why you'd remove unintentionally easy solutions, but most of the time I see this where the patched solution was as clever\/complex as the intended version. It feels like the dev has a mentality of \"There must only be one solution (Minus *those* levels that obviously have more than one)\" and it gets really frustrating.3. Spoilers for true end: Eventually you unlock Overworld-8 then 9 and 10. I was playing 9 and was messing around and I made \"LEVEL IS BABA\". Then I get sent back to the world map and level 9 is baba. First off, I kinda knew at some point something would happen on the world map, but I did not expect this and was pleasantly surprised. However I realised there was another exit, but I could no longer play the level because it is BABA. At this point the game had already saved so I couldn't \"undo\" and hence I was forced into either the Finale level or world ???. I wish there was something there to make it more likely I'd get the other solution first or some way to \"undo\" progression. Not a huge complaint, but was a little bit sadAt this point I'm just going to stop playing and watch the rest of the game online since I'm now constantly stuck. Such a shame since I really wanted to enjoy this.","Very good game, really hard for dumb brain like me.

Both challenging, funny and just plain fun. I would recommend this game to anyone who wants to play exotic games and wants a challenge.","This isn't the Dark Souls of puzzle games. Not because it isn't hard as the depths of hell, but because Dark Souls, for all of it's esotericism, provides a mostly fair challenge where you learn from adversity and can collaborate with others to discover secrets, strategies and overcome challenges.Baba Is You is therefore more comparable to Ninja Gaiden on the NES. A game with difficulty which by all real standards is arbitrary and , yet still has diehard fans who enjoy that kind of difficulty. Unfortunately, (and feel free to insert your own hyperbolic analogy here), just because some people can find enjoyment in it doesn't actually make it good. I'm not bad at the game, by the way. I've 100% completed the first six worlds without actually looking up any solutions, and while I haven't 100% completed the rest of the game, I've made headway into all of the worlds (including the secret world and the secret world inside it). The thing is, were any of the solutions I discovered... fun? Honestly, a lot of the time, nah. The novelty of the system wears off fast, and while some of the levels can be clever, most of them are kind of unintuitive, with overly specific solutions that often expect you to do something that in any other game would bug the game out. Actually figuring the solution out to the challenging levels never feels rewarding, because it's either something that would have been obvious if the game made any attempt to explain it to you, or a obscure and overly specific solution that doesn't feel clever or rewarding to discover because it's more trial and error, narrowing down options, than actually working out a solution on your own terms. I'm guessing this kind of meta-stuff impressed people enough to convince them this game was good, and a lot of people who didn't get too far and just looked up the solutions because the game was too hard for them are either enamoured enough with the easy levels and how clever or meta the later levels seem, or too embarrassed to say the difficulty sucks and come off as unintelligent.I just don't think that as a puzzle game this is anywhere near as fun or clever as it's made up to be. It's hard, unintuitive and esoteric in an obnoxious way, and the trial-and-error puzzling with its narrow solutions is grating as often as it's entertaining. Is it a bad game? Perhaps not. But I wouldn't recommend it by any account.","My favorite game of 2019, good game for anybody who likes puzzles.","Every programmer should play this game","Fun game with amusing and surprising dynamics.

Not just \"peanut butter and chocolate\" stuff, but truly, fundamentally shifts the world of video games on its axis.

The mechanics are quite basic and simple but involve huge potentials to build elements on. And the level design really achieved that by refreshing my understanding of the game again and again. You never know this game enough until you get full achievements unlocked. The game has great difficulties. All hidden contents are fair to obtain and surprising enough. All actions are reversible, which is one of my definitions of serious puzzle games. The equivalence between all game objects is elegant and mind-blowing. And the interaction between levels and menus is my best fun in the game.","Cute game that can get surprisingly challenging. Forces you to think outside the box","This game is a 101% a recommendIt's got great depth, lots of challenging puzzles, a good difficulty curve, pretty aesthetics.If you like puzzle games, this is likely a game for you.","baba is good","Baba is you is one of the best games I have ever played. It made me buy more games of this genre, but I don't expect them to come even close to this one. What I hated about many puzzles (not only in video games) is that it boils down to trying every possible combination of moves that you can perform until you come upon the right one. It is boring and it is something computer can and should do for you. This game is not like that. Here you can reason that this kind of tactic won't work, so you won't lose time considering it later. Here you don't solve levels by trying every possible move, but you use your knowledge and ability to reason to guide you all the way. After I find solution I can almost prove that you have to do this level exactly like this (still finding this solution requires an open mind).This game does a lot of things right. The concept is genius. There are lots of rules (words, objects, special cases) which makes for varied gameplay (each area focuses on some specific words or mechanics). There are also lots of levels (more then 200) so you can learn to use all those mechanics (the way progression works you always have some levels to choose from). Sometimes (may be one in 15 levels) I had to look for hints or solution online. Those are really easy to find and most of the time teach me some smart tactic, and most of the time I will use this tactic later (often much later and often in more difficult level). It is also great that you can always undo your moves.Because there are a lot of words developer had to make some decisions how words will interact with each other. I have no doubt that it gets complicated to develop and program something like this, but you as an player don't have to know all this complexity. The game teaches you things that you will need. Often times solution comes when you notice, that you have tools to perform some experiment too see how things will interact. Most of the time result is as you expect, the game is very consistent.The sound and art are also great. I especially love the sound baba makes when it moves like the sound of wet finger rubbing on rubber, it is so satisfying.","Very fun puzzle game that starts with a very simple base and grows into many very interesting interactions and meta puzzles.","Very inspiring!!!","Probably my favorite puzzle game ever. I can't count how many times my mind was blown by this game.I have a few tips.1. Take your time. If you get stuck, often you'll get the solution after doing something else for a while and coming back to the puzzle.2. This game is great to play with friends. Two heads are better than one, and often each person will come up with a different part of the solution.3. If you think you've finished the game, check your Steam achievements and see if you've collected them all.","Very, very tricky puzzles, and a lot of interesting mechanics, I would highly recommend a blind playthrough, as the game has so much more than you would expect from an average puzzle game.","Should have won the most innovative game award, have never played a game before this where the way to win was to change the mechanics of the game itself","Very fun puzzle game","baba is great","Typical first reaction \"this puzzle is easy\"After 15 seconds \"this puzzle is impossible\"After 30 minutes, puzzle finally solved","enjoyable puzzle game","Am I dumb???","Hard but good.","very good","\"Baba Is You\" is an amazing game.

The ability to alter rules to make innovative solutions and do crazy things! I love breaking rules in games, and this is basically the game about breaking rules! What could possibly go wrong?Unfortunately, the trailer is really misleading. You won't be making unexpected solutions and break every rule possible. Most of the time spent will be used to figure out the one solution developer wants you to perform. And difficulty is often based around Sokoban-style movement restrictions.At some point, I've lost my interest. It is not a bad game and it has it's fans, but it is not an open ended puzzle when you can invent your unorthodox solution and I've never really felt I did anything fun. My solutions weren't anything new, they were all pre-scripted. And I am allergic to Sokoban. Why is moving crates in tight corridors being such a deal? We've got technology to fix that crap. It's like spear throwing olympics.","This is an addicting puzzle game.  If you enjoyed the LoLo series you will love this.","Possibly the greatest puzzle game","BABA IS YOUISBUYANDPLAY","I hate puzzle games but this is awesome.","An absolutely wonderful puzzle game. Absurd in the best possible way.","it's good","Great, mind bending puzzles.","I lost plenty of brain cells.","huge Brian cells","If a good puzzle has a solution that's hard to find yet simple, then this game has good puzzles.","This game is a wonderful concept, but sadly the execution is lacking.To summarize: this is a puzzle game that could thrive greatly on being a sandbox. As much as this game is about bending or breaking the \"rules\", every single level is absolutely 100% rigid. There is only one solution the developer has in mind, and rest assured that it is the only solution to the level. If you dare find an alternate route, it will be patched out.","I wish I was better at it, but damn, when you figure a puzzle out, you feel like a genius.","Baba Is You is a brutally hard puzzle game where you manipulate the very mechanics themselves to jury rig a route to victory. It's sleek, simple, and easy to pick up and understand. It's also deceptively difficult, to the point that the game becomes mentally taxing to play. After the initial puzzles, the game ramps up the difficulty to the extreme, making the overall game laborious to complete. Only the most dedicated of puzzlers will enjoy this.The game is about solving puzzles by remixing common phrases to change the logic of the game. Rather than solve the puzzles in a straight forward manner, you have to shift things around in order to carve a path to the goal. Sometimes this might involve taking control of another character, changing the goal to be something else, deleting certain elements blocking your path, or even manipulating abstract concepts. It's been described as \"programmer-y\", though I would describe it as \"semantic-y\". It's not in the same vein as Space Chem, Infinifactory, or 7 Billion Humans, where you're altering a sequence that has to execute in real time. It's more like you're editing static settings values at specific locations. If there is code \"executing\", you're inside the sequence that's being executed. If that sounds utterly confusing, ignore the previous statements.Baba Is You is definitely brilliant, there is no doubt about that. The mechanics are simple yet mind-bending, the presentation is clean, and the overall game feels smooth to play.However, it fails primarily in execution. While the gameplay is easy to pick up and parse, the game ramps up the difficulty from a tiny incline to a vertical wall roughly 10% into the game, and does so in the most frustrating and tedious ways possible. Once you clear the early stages, expect to spend at least an hour on a single puzzle.It took me a while to really wrap my head around why the game became so difficult. I kept hopping around, or coming back to previous stages, or skipping sections entirely to make progress. With each puzzle, my eyes would glaze over as I took in all the variables and impediments. I'd block out an idea in my head, only to hit some proverbial wall that the developer had actively placed. I'd get half way to a solution, only to have a tiny detail invalidate the whole attempt. I'd restart, over and over, getting more worn down as the game threw out edge case after edge case at me.Eventually, I realized I wasn't having any fun at all. In fact, during the first few stages, when my eyes were wide and my imagination was open, I was quite enthusiastic about playing. Once that faded, I stopped looking forward to puzzles, and instead looked for excuses to quit. It became a blackhole that I'd boot up, where my fun went to die.I've played a lot of puzzle games, both easy and hard. I'd like to think I'm competent enough at the genre to know when something isn't fun.Puzzle games are about reaching solutions using analysis or trial and error. As I see it, there are two types of reasonable puzzles. Those with one solution, and few variables; or those with many solutions, and many variables. Deviation from this introduces too much noise into the puzzle, making it far more difficult to solve.Baba Is You's puzzles have only one intended solution, and are rigidly bulletproofed against any sort of creativity. Despite being a game about reinventing the rules, you're really just retracing the developer's intended path. If you don't see the puzzle the same way they do, then you'll have to keep retrying until you do. You're not thinking outside the box, you're thinking inside the developer's box.Baba Is You's puzzle structure has too many steps and too many things to keep track of. You're trying to solve a puzzle with a large number of possible moves and variations, with no capacity to improvise. You'll spend 30 minutes devising a solution only for the last step to fail, just because it's not \"the\" solution. To make matters worse, some puzzles require a setup that naturally cascades into the solution over the course of several moves. Good luck formulating those.If that weren't enough, many of these puzzles also rely on quirks that you'd only discover by pure luck. A new block will be introduced with a patronizly easy puzzle, and then afterwards ramp up to the point of absurdity. Once I realized that certain puzzles were unsolvable unless you knew a specific strategy, I began future puzzles with the nagging sense that I wasn't equipped to solve them. How am I supposed to walk the logic back when I don't know if you're going to be using the same rules you taught me in the previous examples?If the game's puzzles were small, one solution would be fine. If the game was open-ended, and you could solve in any way you could make it work, then having complex puzzles would be acceptable. If the quirky behaviour was better telegraphed or implied, rather than undetectable until you waste multiple hours on a seemingly \"impossible\" puzzle, then unexpected behaviour would be welcome. To marry one solution with such complexity, while also introducing rules with obscure behaviour, makes this tedious and mentally exhausting to solve.I must stress, this is not a slight against the actual concept of Baba Is You. I have no problem with manipulating the game's logic using semantics. I think this idea is genius, I just wish it was executed in a way where I would get to experience more than 20% of the game. These puzzles did not need to be this challenging, or at the very least, not until the very end of the game.The game boasts 220 puzzles, and I have no doubt that there are people out there who will enjoy it. I also realize there are people out there who see entire ultra hard crossword or sudoku books as hundreds of hours of fun. People who enjoy replaying the old text-based adventure games with extremely strict semantics. People who enjoy running through all of the Chip's Challenge games back to back. Does any of that sound appealing? Then this is probably THE game for you.If not... run far away. Only frustration, exhaustion, and regret await.I feel bad giving a negative rating to a game that displays such brilliance and purity of form. Perhaps if it weren't so blindingly hard, or tedious, or rigid, or obtuse, or mentally taxing, I could see myself giving this an easy masterpiece grade. In it's current state, it's far too challenging to complete. Its solutions are too specific, too cavernous, and too obscure to decode. To some people, this might as well be a positive review touting a game that is the epitome of puzzling excellence. I consider it a warning, mainly to ward off those mere mortals who fancy themselves as puzzlers.Steam Curator","The real most innovative game of 2019.","You will find out, over and over and over again, that this game is pure genius.

Don't have a key to open the door? Make 'BOX has KEY' and break the box to find one, or make 'BOX is OPEN' and use the box to unlock the door. Surrounded by an impassable wall? Separate 'WALL is STOP' and suddenly that wall is no trouble anymore. Can't cross the water to reach the flag and win? Maybe you'll have to give something else the 'WIN' condition instead...But it's not too long before the game starts to really test your wits, forcing you to engage in plenty of trial-and-error before a solution becomes apparent. Maybe you have several rocks and need to transform one - and only one - into a key. Maybe you need to control multiple characters at once, or temporarily lose control of them altogether. Maybe you'll even have to manipulate the empty spaces in the level to open a path to the goal. The game is challenging for sure, but it's also such a blast to encounter new keywords and figure out how to utilize them in creative ways to make the impossible possible.And there's one ingenious moment where, if you're clever enough, you'll discover just how meta this game can be...and it only goes deeper from there.It's difficult, it's fun, it's mind-boggling, and it's packed to the brim with \"Aha!\" moments.

Mind-bending, but friendly in how it slowly introduces new mechanics in the game.","good puzzle","This is the best logic game I have ever played.Everything in \"Baba is You\" is about changing rules. Even thought it may look simple on trailer, every world introduces new tricky elements that are constantly blowing mind. Many of solutions are surprising, leading to feeling like \"wow, how did they invent it?\".Some levels are really hard, but not in means of \"cheap difficulty\". In most of them, there were only few elements... and I still had no idea how to combine them for long time. Resolving such puzzles brings much satisfation, especially because the game hits all the right boxes.I have much appreciation to developers, because game consists everything that I would expect from logic game. There are complex puzzles, original mechanics and funny world (and secret levels). I can't find proper words to describe \"Baba is You\" accurately - this is not just a game, this is an experience.In addtion, this experience is really long. Right now, after almost 25 hours, I have finished maybe around half of all levels.Grade: 10\/10Postscriptum: I am quite experienced in logic games. Thus, I have to add a warning for less experienced players: you will have hard times. VERY hard times. In fact, experienced players will have hard times too, but I don't warn them, because I know they like it ;).","It's Super Meat Boy for your neurons.Genius bliss, beyond amazing.","BABA is STUPID","This Game is ingenious!","Great game, really difficult puzzles.","A puzzle mechanic so pure and far-reaching that it has made me laugh on a number of occasions.Any game that can tell a joke in just three words gets a thumbs up from me.","One of the most clever puzzle games I've ever played. I've put 10 hours into it and still barely halfway through the levels. It's really hard, so be ready for a challenge.","My favourite puzzle game at this moment, I don't think I've ever seen one as creative and innovative as Baba Is You. Spent over 100 hours to collect all 226 spores and complete the game, giving me a lot of entertainment for 1-2 months until I got stuck on finding the final level, which took me many more evenings spread over the course of another month until I found the way. Highly recommended, money well spent.","this game is mind blowing!","Played for 3 hours and loving it. Before this game I would have bet, that there's nothing one can possibly do with the Sokoban mechanic, that makes it more interesting and fun. Little did I know... :) Such a great Idea. Lovable simple design in both look and sound. Thanks for this great little game. I'm looking forward to get my brain scrambled in the levels to come.","Game is awesome. Baba is rock. Headblown is you.","I've seen that others have played this game and thought I should try it. It is addictive and puzzling, I never want to stop because it's not fun, I only ever stop because I feel like I am missing something and am frustrated by how simple the design is but how complex the puzzles are. I plan on 100% this game like i usually do and would recommend this to anyone and everyone that likes puzzles and\/or challenges.","brain is stop and melt","You is win","great game","How do you describe a game like this? Brain stretching comes readily to mind. What looks like a simple puzzle game in the first instance, becomes increasingly more complex as you progress through the levels. In most games what you learn on one level helps you with the next, but not with this one. That makes it either annoying or more interesting because of the increased challenge.(I tend to think it makes it more interesting .. just me.) But if you like logical puzzles, querky graphics, and a challenge ... this one is for you. Love it!","Some of these levels make me feel really smart. Many others on the other hand make me feel like an absolute idiot.

Lots of neat puzzles requiring lateral thinking. That goes on for quite a while. Eventually the puzzles throw enough rules in place that they force you into one particular solution, always obscure, and not really fun anymore to find.

Can get hard!","Fun and makes you think.","Baba is a strategical puzzle game created as if the programmer and storyboard writer swap places. It is quirky, challenging, and fun. The mechanics besides (empty) are well designed and intuitive. Your brain will expand and shrink in the same rate during the day. Baba is you rewards clever gameplay and planning. The music is nice and the graphics grow on you. I would highly recommend. I am Baba and so are you.","Baba Is You is one of the best puzzle games I have ever experienced. After fully completing this amazing game, I can proudly call myself Baba.","Underneath the cute appearance is a horrendously difficult puzzle game. It's incredibly clever and unique in its style. 10\/10 would continuously return to over and over and over again because these cute puzzles haunt me in my dreams.","A difficult yet fun game that requires thinking outside the box","Really analytic game!","Simply amazing puzzle game. The concept of letting you solve puzzles by manoeuvring rules that appear as movable pieces on the grid along with all other objects in the level is brilliant. I never feel like this game ramps up the difficulty in cheap ways (bigger levels with more objects or too many rules). It rarely forces you to lose time fiddling with the actual execution. It's all about finding the right ideas. It was a delight to find out about weird interactions between properties. You can get to the normal ending without having to solve the real brain-busters, but there's a lot of added value for those who want to discover all the extras and secrets. Definitely recommended.","revolutionary coding game!","I'm not especially good at this game, or very far into it, but nonetheless very enjoyable.","This game is amazing!","Great puzzle game.","Yes","Baba is good","Game design is brilliant and deserves all the awards it's been nominated for!","its a good game","Gameplay mechanics are simple but the way they are used makes some of the puzzles really complicated and mind boggling.Truly a masterpiece of a puzzle game with tons of levels (+200) with their own twists and surprises right up to the end, levels just keep getting harder and harder.It is worthwhile to take breaks when playing this game to reset your way of thinking as sometimes cycling through the different options how to complete a level, you will get stuck trying to use solution that has worked on couple earlier levels and it will make you stuck completely. (or at least that happened to me couple of times)If you like puzzle games I can recommend this one a lot, for the price and the amount of levels it has, it is well worth it.For people looking to 100%, well it is puzzle game so you can find solutions\/hints for everything, but considering how many levels it has it will still take you decently long time (I would guess at least 15-20h) to complete the game 100%.","Really makes you think outside the box. And sometimes box is you.","Truly Amazing!","An elegant mind game. Very difficult but is a great gift to problem solving lovers.","A game in the Sokoban family but with an interesting twist that you are manipulating sentences that determine the rules.  Do not be afraid to make combinations that at first seem absurd.  I must admit that I have on a few occasions Googled for hints to get past particularly challenging levels; there are sites that give hints short of a walk through and often a small nudge is all that is needed.","These are quite challenging puzzles.  The gameplay reminds me of the concept of \"escape rooms\".I think the high price is justified, because the game uses an EXQUISITE multi-move undo that really sets it apart from other puzzle games.  You can make as many moves as you like in a puzzle and jam on the back button and undo them all if you like.And the puzzles are fantastic.  There is a deep satisfaction in solving them.How does it work?- Puzzle \"rooms\" are locked down several branched paths, so if you get stuck on a puzzle, there will still be several others you can work on branching in a different direction.  This feature is golden.- To solve a puzzle, push words around to affect the rules- Reach a win condition.For example, the default win condition in many puzzles is \"FLAG IS WIN\".  But you can push the word \"FLAG\" away from \"IS WIN\" and now it's no longer a win condition.  By pushing the rule words around you can eventually reach a win condition - but sometimes the rules are not obvious and how things work have to be inferred or just experimented with to see whether your idea is going to work.  It's wonderful fun and a great feeling of being completely lost and trying various ideas to find a solution.  They are all very diverse puzzles and the thought process changes from one puzzle to another (at least it felt this way for me).https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/sharedfiles\/filedetails\/?id=2035514518The graphics, for as simplistic as they are, are very nicely animated which adds HUGE depth to the gameplay and atmosphere.I really hesitated writing a review because of the high price of this game, and after playing it for a while the features won me over.  This is not your every-day cranked out puzzle game - a lot of love and diligence went into the implementation and I think it's worth a try, especially if you like these sorts of puzzles.","game is good","This is a cute and clever puzzle game where you win by changing the rules: the rules are literally spelled out by blocks that you can push around and rearrange. You'll need to experiment to learn what exactly each new rule means. Try lots of things, and don't be afraid to undo or restart the level! What you discover along the way will surprise and delight you (and help you solve the puzzles). This game is best played with friends. There's no multiplayer mode, but the puzzles get challenging fast, and it will be less frustrating with another person to help brainstorm. This works best when whoever has an idea can take over the keyboard, but it can also work over screenshare, especially if you both have a copy of the game so you can trade off who controls each level.","really fun game. a bit frustrating at times but i love how there's a lot of creative thinking involved in trying to get through each level. would recommend highly for puzzle game enthusiasts","Every single level manages to introduce an entirely new concept and blow your mind with it.","A challenging puzzle game with a truly novel core mechanic.","Hard but fun, and so rewarding when you get them. Feels unique for a puzzle game","This is so fun, frustrating and rewarding. Once you play it you start to love the out of the box mentality and that lovely bunny rabbit that is drawn like there is something awfully wrong in its movement, yet it runs around happily and just a bunnydust follows. There are things that I won't understand at the times and once it clicks, I'm at awe like a child.  And the beat or song background is so soothing it tames the nerves even in desperate times I am stuck. I feel that I need Baba in my real life too. <3","Be careful, this game is genius and evil. You may melt your brain while playing, so take breaks accordingly. Also note that this game isn't fast to finish. Far from it. Elseway it's incredible though!","solution is hidebrain is weak","This must be the Dark-Souls of puzzle-games xDJokes aside, this is by far the hardest puzzle game I've encountered and I played Antichamber. But \"Baba is You\" is as fair as it can be.You have a small set of game-rules, with which you can push blocks to create rules within a level. Every level-rule is written out on screen, as well as in the menue. So it's as fair as can be, without hidden mechanics or off-screen features.Yet unless I am really stupid, it's hard as hell - I can't play it for more than a couple minutes at a time, before I have to quit and get some off-time to think about the puzzlesor distract myself in hopes my brain will at some point get around to understand the puzzle.It's not just \"a\" unique challenge, but every new level feels like a completly new game, where you are going to learn something new, because the tricks you used before, won't be enough.So it's hard, it's challenging, but it's fair and you can restart every level within seconds or undo moves.What I don't know is if recommending solutions is a thing. It's a puzzle game, so looking up a solution defeats the purpose. But at the same time, with every level being a new challenge and me already feeling overwhelmed in the 3rd region...","baba is you? yes. Baba is good? yes. Baba is all? yes.","dummy is me","This game blows me away. Not only is the core concept genius, but the execution is flawless.

The rules are very simple to understand and pick up on, but the enjoyable thing about this game is how it pushes you to think outside the box. The rules in the game are there for you to manipulate in any combination of ways you can come up with, and the trial and error \"what if?\" process provides a novel sense of satisfaction as you brainstorm solutions and try them out. The difficulty level of this game is enjoyably challenging. Even for levels I found to be on the trickier side, I never felt frustrated or like giving up.

The levels range from easy tutorial levels to mind numbingly difficult, but the solutions are never cheap. The soundtrack is great and the art is charming. Perhaps my favorite part about it is that with many of the levels that I was stuck on the solution did not reveal itself while playing, but while doing mundane activities like brushing my teeth, because the game knew how to stick in my head. It took me rather long to beat on account of me being sometimes dumb and slow on experimenting with the mechanics, but all in all I am satisfied with what I got and hope that others playing it will get just as much if not more out of it.","If you ever wanted to feel smart and completely idiotic all at the same time this is your game.","very hard like my pp","Clever fun puzzles, charming style.

As a completionist, it makes puzzles feel more like homework rather than something you enjoy doing for fun.","this game is hard and i hate it but also buy it it's fun","great","The most creative puzzle game I have ever played.","Game of the year.","if you want some mind , this is the game","Great game.","I used to say that I am good at playing puzzle games.But after this,I won't say that again.","A unique puzzle game.

The basic idea is to change the rules that govern each level, in order to pass the level. The rules are presented as blocks that you can manipulate by pushing them around. Sometimes you have to completely break the game in order to pass the level. Sometimes more subtle changes are enough. However, out-of-the-box -thinking is required almost always.The game is difficult, but mostly there're always other areas and levels that you can try if you can't pass some specific level.  Probably there's a point where you have only seemingly impossible levels left, but after solving 60+ levels, I haven't reached it yet. Actually there's multiple areas I haven't even tried yet. Of course, you have to solve some levels in order to unlock new areas, but at least in the beginning of the game, this isn't that difficult.","the puzzles are very intruguing, and mind-bending"],["It's a good puzzle game!If you don't know why I would like Baba is You go watch the promotional material.

Don't let the price or graphics dissuade you.Some of the levels are very hard without hints, but I recommend not using any, just leave it and come back later.

Or maybe you are the box. Box Is You? Its the most brain warping mind  since Antichamber. And much like Antichamber forced you to think differently to progress and did something totally new, so does Baba Is You, though it goes about things with a very different method to its madness. You play as the titular Baba in which you push around text tiles to rewrite the rules to the game a you play. I really dont want to say too much about how the mechanics work as part of the charm is discovering things, so I will be deliberately vague.The game does a very good job of introducing new mechanics in a way that neither spoon feeds you the how-to nor are they overly obtuse. After a new mechanic is introduced the next few levels will make you throw your thinking as far outside the box as possible to figure out the solution. Suffice it to say rarely has a game thats managed to make me feel so smart and so stupid at the same time once I figure out the solution to a level.https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/sharedfiles\/filedetails\/?id=2046540923The game is divided in to worlds filled with a number of levels. You have some freedom in choosing what levels to complete as the map branches some and youre not required to complete all levels in a world to progress. This is a good thing as some levels are tough as hell to figure out. By allowing a bit of freedom in level selection it helps prevent one from getting frustrated if theyre stuck on a level, allowing them to try their hand at another and return at a later time for another crack at things.As of this writing Ive logged a little over 18 hours in the game and Ive completed around 40% of the levels. I intend to keep playing the game and hopefully knock out some more levels, but Ill be honest, Im not sure that Im smart enough to actually get all of them. That said, Ive enjoyed every minute Baba so far and it was well worth the purchase and playtime even if Im not able to progress further.https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/sharedfiles\/filedetails\/?id=2047566893 If you at all enjoy puzzle games absolutely buy Baba Is You. Its so creative and innovative and when youre done youll turn into Brain Is Fried.","One of the most innovative, complex, and challenging puzzle games I have ever played.","Amazing game, very good idea and well made execution! My only complaint is about the little inconsistency in the behavior of \"SHIFT\" objects that cannot push thing A onto thing B despite thing B itself not being either push or pull, well, it's hard to explain, but it breaks the logic a little bit for me, but still, it is awesome and a great mind bender! :)","brain is meltbaba is you","Game is goodBrain is hurtMoney is spendTime is goneGame is worthYou buy game                                                           Yes","Excellent game and love it, it would be better with workshop\/custom map editor\/playground| G A || H A |{      }\n| M E ||  S  |{      }\n\n              | WORK |  | PLAY | | MAP  |\n              | SHOP |  | GRND | | EDTR |\n                \n              | Y___ |           \n              | uuuu |           \n\n\n\n| B A || I  | |  Y   |\n| B A ||  S | |  OU  |","Brilliant puzzle game with a plethora of levels. Excellent value.","Awesome game, never been that addicted to a puzzle game. Used to be a Dark Souls player, and this thing is also very hard!","Other reviews have said this far better than I can. This game throws new mechanics at you and expects you to know them right off the bat. Which sucks because the first levels of this game had me hooked only to be met with disappointment. On top of all that, this game is so visually unappealing. Along with the sound design and music being virtually pointless considering how lazy they are. My biggest problem with the game is the initial draw of being able to find creative solutions by manipulating the pieces, only to discover that all of the puzzles require one or two very specific solutions rather than you're own out of the box discovery. I don't know why this game got so much praise. Buy it if you want to not have fun for hours and feel mild satisfaction for a few seconds every time you solve a puzzle.","very nice logic game.","it is very hard but a lot of fun","It's a stellar example of how the puzzle genre can innovate. The mechanics are simple- there are only a few truly ironclad rules, with the rest of the games rules unfolding, changing, and being destroyed as you play. Despite the incredible amount of rules, most mechanics are learned in a natural exploratory way,as the game itself is played with only two buttons and a d-pad. Although the \"I didn't know you could do that\" puzzle does rear it's ugly head occasionally, the large majority of solutions arise as a natural result of the core rules. Also, this game is incredibly hard to 100% on your own. Coming back to puzzles at a later date with some new tricks and new headspace helps. There are also some great hint guides out there that will help without giving away the solutions. I highly recommend them if you don't want to be playing Baba Is You over the course of several weeks.","Its a great game. It keeps making your brain think alternative solutions to win each level. It's greatly designed","10\/10","11\/10- puzzles with various difficulties- nice graphic- easy to learn- if you think you have finished the game, you're not.- many secrets to be found.- GAME IS GOOD- BABA IS YOU- BABA IS HAPPY","So hard, but so much fun! For many levels, the title is a hint. I've got the idea from the title for many times.","Baba is yeah","I would recommend this to others. In this game you rewrite the rules so you can win. Frustration is unavoidable if you are to play this game. Through exposing yourself to frustration in this low stakes environment you might be able to develop your capacity to cope with adversity in your own life. I can't say for sure. It's a good game. If you are having trouble with a puzzle, come back a day later, after you've slept. You figure out some of the problems as you sleep. Try and get your 8 hours in - that's good advice even if you don't buy this game.Take care.","Very clever little game.

It certainly helped that the person playing was very entertaining.

You may easily find yourself spending half an hour staring at a level that stumps you, only to realise what the solution is and execute it in less than a minute. It offers dozens of levels divided into zones, of which you only need to complete a handful to advance to the next zone. This helps keep the game fresh and gives you new stuff to look at when\/if you need a break from a puzzle that isn't clicking with you. This may be beneficial to you as some levels will require you to use interactions you may not have known existed before, and some levels make them more intuitive to figure out than others. Zones are themed and provide a nice bit of visual cohesion without going as far as to imply a story or a narrative, which makes the game pretty easy to drop and return to at any time.Despite how difficult the game can get only a couple of zones in, I do not feel intimidated when I return to it and can confidently recommend it to anyone who enjoys a puzzler that encourages you to think systematically but also outside of the box at the same time.","Me am push word me am lose braincell","good","my GF doesn't play games and she said, \"it's a really fun game\"","this sheep man will drive me mad and I love it","amazing ","Amazing puzzle game!","I'm too dumb for this game.","This game is ingenious.","Simple graphics, runs on basic hardware, simple controls, makes you think, nice learning curve, ingenious puzzles, small download size, rewarding gameplay.

Baba is good.","I'll say this right here and now - Baba Is You is the spiritual successor to PortalBoth of the games have a single, very specific system with a few overarching rules. Like the best of any kind of system, they're broad enough that their interactions create countless unique interactions, and the potential to pull out some crazy solutions to the problems presented to the player. The best kind of puzzle game rewards clever thinking, going outside the box and using your understanding of the system's interactions to circumvent seemingly impossible situations, and both allow for solutions outside what the developer intended. Both games have that powerful 'click' of ecstasy when you figure out how to win the room you're in, and it slowly builds on itself as you get further in, forcing you to employ earlier techniques in more outlandish ways as you're forced into more diabolical puzzles. This isn't a game for smart people, necessarily. It's a game for people who are -clever-.One of the most important parts of Baba Is You, that Portal also excelled at, was teaching you how to play the game without bashing you over the head with it. It starts off with basic concepts, obviously enough, but rather than having a big tutorial saying NOW WHY DON'T YOU TRY THIS, it presents the early puzzles in ways that slowly build up the player's understanding of various techniques and tricks they can use, leading into the next puzzle in a perfectly organic learning curve that even the best of games utterly fail at. Baba Is You encourages players to break away from the old habits and concepts that they've had built into them after playing video games for so long. Walls are not just barriers any more, they're just as much a tool as a rock or a key is, and the faster you free yourself of your preconceived notions on what something is, the quicker you'll acclimate to this game.While it doesn't have Portal's quirky dialogue or humor, the simple-but-not-lazy style serves to reinforce the stark simplicity Baba Is You revels in. It looks and feels like a nursery rhyme version of the old Chip's Challenge. The music, admittedly, does get tiresome after listening to it on loop while staring at a particularly troublesome mindbender, though it seems designed to be as non-intrusive as background music can get.I really can't stress how inventive and clever such an innocent seeming package can be. Baba Is You stands head and shoulders above other puzzle games in terms of ingenuity and proving that fresh concepts can still be found. Baba Is You will undoubtedly stand the test of time as a modern classic, showing off how less can be considerably more, and reinventing how people think of puzzles for ages to come, much like Portal did back when it crashed onto the scene.","The perfect puzzle game","Puzzle games aren't usually able to hold my attention for this long, but the clever puzzles and creative mechanics have me constantly coming back for more.","Me and my friends argued with eachother on a level that we were thinking way too hard about. We ended up completing the level and settled on calling eachother gay and retarded."],["Hard but rewarding","Lovely puzzle game putting a very creative and refreshing take on block pushing. Solidly designed levels, often with solutions more so necessitating lateral thinking than exacting manoeuvres. Offers a fairly serious challenge, and doesn't overstay it's welcome. It's also worth stating that the game does a good job at introducing mechanics without bogging you down with excessive tutorials.If you're not put off by every so often clearing a level and going \"was I meant to do that?\", this is highly recommended.","BABA. IS. GOOD. AND. PUZZLE. GAME.BABA IS YOU is a simple yet genius puzzle game, featuring the sheep? Baba as he pushes blocks to create simple sentences to give properties to items and uses them to solve puzzles and explore a vast selection of levels. It's such a simple concept but it works so well for a puzzle game.Gameplay in BABA IS YOU has a lot of moving block to create phrases in order to give the objects in a level a certain function or property. For Example, the phrase BABA IS YOU gives the control of BABA to you so you can move him around and FLAG IS WIN make the Flag object the key to solve the puzzle and you can mix and match all the words at your hearts content. The gameplay is so simple but provides pretty much limitless ideas for puzzles and many of these honestly stumped me from time to time. Baba also has plenty of puzzles to keep you busy with themed worlds and even some secret areas but shhh....The artstyle and overall theming of BABA IS YOU is one of the most memorable part about the game as the simple pixel art graphics along with the calm and atmospheric music in each of the levels makes for such a interesting experience while trying to figure out the many puzzles the game has.Lastly, I have seen potential for a Level Editor which I think would be a amazing idea as it has the potential to have people create their own puzzles and give the game a big boost in replayability. I am aware that there is a somewhat functional way to get a level editor running, but not in a way to make it easily accessible to the public. Overall, BABA IS YOU is a solid puzzle game featuring a simple idea that is uses in many different ways to create some of the most interesting puzzles I've seen in a while, it always had something new up it's sleeve to feature in the next puzzle I played. The only negative I Have other than the sheer difficult from some of the puzzles, is that the game is kinda pricey, being about 15$ which I honestly think is a bit too much but at least it is possible to get it on sale.REVIEW.

Every level is extremely satisfying to solve!","Baba is YouGame is Good and Hard","Baba is youtrex is happy","Baba is You is one of the best puzzle games I played in my life. It's hard at times, but not in a way that makes you hate the game (for example if it didn't have the option to rewind, you'd have to restart some levels over and over because of a tiny mistake). Even when levels are easy, the solutions are still pretty original and fun.100% Recommended. I had been waiting for this to go on discount for a while, but ended up buying it at full price and I don't regret it. Totally worth my money.If you get really stuck, I recommend you to google \"Baba is Hint\", it's a guide with hints meaning to help you get unstuck without actually spoiling the actual solutions. So you still have to think.","This is currently my favorite puzzle game, possibly of all time. The mechanics are very unique and make a certain weird kind of sense after you have played it for a while. The first few puzzles are fairly easy and then the game rapidly gets extremely difficult, but solving that one puzzle you have been stuck on for hours (or days) is always so satisfying.A handful of the levels have a very specific solution that sometimes feels like it shouldn't work quite the way it does, but mostly the solutions are the sort of 'well duh, why didn't I see that earlier' sort of thing that you come to after thinking about it for a while.Baba is Love.","It's a noice puzzle game. Don't know much else to say. 9.5\/10","This game's puzzle mechanics are unique, but requires some intense thinking. However, the game is fair and does not give trick solutions to the problem. For a fun puzzle experience, I would certainly recommend it.","Great game for people with a PhD in philosophy.If you do not have a PhD then do NOT buy this game. If you haven't spent hours upon hours researching dense academic material you won't be able to complete the first couple of levels. Without reading all of George Berkeley's works, how can you even begin to understand statements like \"Lava is more and hot\" coupled with mindblasters like \"Flag is melt and win\" and \"Baba is hot\". Esse is percipi (or for those monkeys that don't know basic Latin: to be is to be perceived) is crucial for at least a dozen levels of \"Baba Is You\". If you don't have a wide understanding of all the different philosophical schools of thought don't even bother reading the rest of this review. Nihilism is especially ingrained in the game's mechanics which is even evident in the likeness of the name \"Baba Is You\" to the Friedrich Nietzsche's famous line \"God is dead\". The ingenious ways that logical premises can be constructed and deconstructed only reassure the players that space, time and causation are mere sensibilities. After reading this you might still think you might give it a shot but didn't you learn in high school that things in themselves exist but their nature is unknowable? I smirk at those addlepated simpletons that bought this game without understanding the hermeneutic circle, struggling to apply knowledge from previous levels in the reference to the game as a whole. Without a PhD how would you even analyse this game from a meta perspective? Not in a million years would you think of realising this game is actually a beautiful existentialist work on par with works of Sartre, Kafka or Camus. Every level is a journey and at the end of each is a profound tautology.Bravo Arvi Teikari, Bravo! I hope I will get to test my beliefs through one of your games again.","its good if you have a lot of time in your hands","Definitely one of the most interesting twists I have seen on a puzzle game. Moving the words around to change the rules in which you interact with the levels is such an engaging and fun concept. A lot of the puzzles will be real be real brain busters, but there is an immense sense of satisfaction upon completing each segment.  I love it when I get that big EUREKA! moment and everything thing else in the puzzle starts making more sense in context. If you're looking for a puzzle game that both makes you feel like an idiot and a genius at the same time then I definitely recommend this.","A very good and genius puzzle game.","Together with Talos Principle best puzzle game ever. I spent 100+ hours with it and was amazed by neverending flow of new principles and good ideas. Solutions are rarely repeated.Plus the graphics is cute and the music did not annoy me even after 100 hours.The only thing that annoyed me is the navigation on the map in the final stages where you control more objects than just the cursor.","good puzzle gaem, make think yes","s","Baba is You offers an interesting take on the puzzle genre. In essence, it is a combination of Sokoban and programming. While the programming portion of manipulating the rules already gives it infinite potential to make any puzzle, the Sokuban aspect contextualizes the puzzles to make them less abstract (even then Baba is You is an extremely abstract game). This freedom of the mechanics allows for really wild setups that can be made, giving the player many tools (tools in the sense of ideas, and not an in-game gameplay ability) at their disposal. Many levels thought the whole game is designed around figuring out those tools. On the other side, those tools are later reused in tandem with other ideas to create more and more complex levels. Those would be the majority of the levels in-game, even though most players would find themselves taking more time on the former set of levels. Till the very end of the game, new rules are getting added, which adds more and more that can be learned. This isn't to say that the game just plays on a new gimmick for every level to keep the attention of the player - it thoroughly explores each and every mechanic it present to the player. The game is very long and it can feel like it has already exhausted what it can teach you by the end, even though by the very nature of the mechanics this is impossible. While the game offers extremely interesting puzzles and mechanics, it still suffers several issues. It has somewhat inconsistent difficulty, which gets worse the deeper you get in the game (in a sense this is close to unavoidable to an extent considering how abstract the puzzles get later on). A good amount of the levels that are about learning a new trick could be very abstruse to figure out in the most later zones. Also, the last zone reuses many ideas of the first zones, however, by that point in the game, the player might have forgotten some of the less used ideas - I found myself having to replay the game twice to be able to beat the full game due to this. It would have been nice to have a refresher to those ideas somewhere so that the player should not figure them out again but in a more complex scenario. The game is still amazing, even if the last areas are not paced as good as the rest of the game (they still offer some of the best puzzles in the game). The game is also going to get an official level editor in the future and with the nature of the mechanics, it has amazing potential for community levels.","brain is smallbaba is too hard for my smal peanut,,,,","A nice little game to train your ability to bend your brain to think outside of the box (sometimes literally!). I am still missing a secret or two, but I think I have a pretty good idea where to find them...It's a bit odd that some say that this game gets too difficult too fast, and that levels later in the game are obscure and basically impossible without a guide because they require arcane incantations of precise button inputs with no way to know what works and when.They really are not that obscure, and most of the levels either have a new trick they guide you to find and are otherwise short, or have a logical progression to them, allowing incremental and progressive solving with a clear goal and a high-level strategy with steps that are achievable from the previous step with a few moves with clear direction and purpose. This is the exact opposite of the supposedly obscure, opaque, intractable complexity some claim the game to suffer from.A great game, overall. Hopefully, I end up finding that there is yet another layer to it that I have not found yet. I just do not want it to end...Edit: Completed the game. The very last secret was not really that difficult to find, but I kept missing it. A great game, but now All is Done and I want more...","Hello, I had a lot of fun while playing. It's a good game.

Really happy I got it.",";)","Baba Is You is deceptively simple, aggravatingly complex, and immensely satisfying. I haven't yet played through all the puzzles myself, and I can't even say I've enjoyed every second of gameplay when a puzzle has me stumped, but this charming little game will draw you back in again and again with its cute graphics, catchy music, and baffling logic puzzles.Baba Is You relies on manipulating simple rules to change how Baba (that's you!) interacts with the world around them, which is accomplished by literally pushing words around to create and destroy existing rules. Your goal is to reach the win condition - and I say win 'condition' because said condition changes depending on how you've changed the rules. But it's not as confusing as it sounds! If you've ever taken a logic or computer science class, you'll likely find your footing relatively quickly, but even if you haven't, it's very easy to learn. That's part of Baba Is You's charm: the gameplay and the solutions to each puzzle are simple, even if finding the solution will make you want to give up time and time again. What I particularly liked about this game is that completing one puzzle unlocks 2 to 3 other puzzles for you to work on next - which meant that if I got stuck on one puzzle, I was welcome to try the others, or go to a new area and start afresh with new rules, new music, and new puzzles. (Or, you know, turn off the game and come back later. You'll find yourself doing this if you're like me and refuse to look up walkthroughs.) The satisfaction that comes from solving a particularly head-scratching puzzle is worth the time you put in, too. Overall, if you need a game that you can open up, try a puzzle, and then close again within 5 to 10 minutes, Baba Is You will serve very well - just be ready to leave some puzzles unfinished as you go. You can always come back to them later!","It's really fun, but some of the puzzles stump me...","adorable and logical is a great combination. get this game if you like puzzles and the joy of discovery.","GAME is HOTBRAIN is MELTGod this game is f***ing hard","Really fun and unique puzzle game","Baba is hard","Game Is Great","It's a fun little game, I don't suggest playing it for long periods of time as it's fairly exhausting mentally. The difficulty seems pretty inconsistent at some points and there's quite a few times where the game expects you to understand an unexplained mechanic. If you're the kind of person who likes trying everything and bashing your head against the wall into a bloody pulp it's definitely for you.","A friendly block puzzle game about messing with predicate logic.  The puzzles are creative and force you to challenge your assumptions, and the undo feature gives you plenty of room to experiment.  Overall fun to play and rewarding to solve.One complaint is that the player can't attempt the levels in any order, despite the lack of a consistent difficulty progression. Since most puzzles require an \"aha\" moment, rather than incorporating lessons from previous puzzles, the level order seems arbitrary and can gate off much of the game's content if the player gets stuck on a level.  It would be more fun if the player could skip ahead to later levels.","super clever, but dangerously addictive","fun, challenging, lots of thinking outside of the box to solve puzzles. I'm determined to beat every level.","Brain Is Melt.","I really enjoyed this game. Definitely one of my favourite puzzle games.The game is a Sokoban-like where you not only push boxes but also the rules of the game, constantly changing which objects you can control, push, pull, ...

I love the variations in ways of solving too (Though I am only about 30 puzzles through at this moment, and have heard that it may change later)And whenever you solve a puzzle it really makes you feel like a genius, so yes that's nice too. Just waiting for a level editor now!","Wow. If you like puzzle games, then this is for you. If you like being frustrated, then this is for you. But above all else, baba is you.","Very cool.  Really needs a programmer's mindset to get through it.","Conclusion first:If you're looking for a puzzle game that requires some amount of thinking, this is a great game to pickup.However, if you don't like figuring out puzzles for yourself, then I wouldn't recommend it: you will get nothing out of this game by looking up the solutions.Keeping in mind that I'm only a few worlds (in the Mario sense) into the game, I would really recommend this to fans of puzzle games. No object in this game has qualities that aren't assigned to them somewhere on the puzzle's map, whether that be \"WALL IS STOP\", \"ROCK IS PUSH\", \"BABA IS YOU\", or any number of other combinations. Solving these puzzles requires manipulation of these rules and objects to reach an object that \"IS WIN\" with an object that \"IS YOU\".Difficulty within a world increases with each puzzle. Personally, I found the first head scratchers were the challenge puzzles at the Lake, but the first one I had to walk away from was the first challenge puzzle of the Solitary Isle. As of writing this, I haven't completed that puzzle yet.Typically you get some new words to work with in each world, with the first puzzle or two being an easier introduction, but the difficulty floor does increase for each world. For example, the first couple of puzzles in world 2 are easier than the last few in level 1 (and much easier than the challenge puzzles). Your hand is not held in the slightest; a puzzle is presented in full (nothing hidden), and you need to solve it. You can check the active rules in the menu, if you'd like, but that's all you're given.The art is simplistic. Strangely cute, IMO.The music is simple and chill. I haven't noticed if it actually changes between levels or not. I'll probably end up muting the BGM and playing different music instead. This isn't the type of game where I really care about the the sound design.","This game melts my head","Baba is You is a game like no other. Clever; challenging; cute. Those are the three main words that come to mind when I think of it or (as so often happens) recommend it. While there isn't so much more I can say that a short first-impressions video on Youtube wouldn't better present, let me, in the following paragraphs, say why this game is worthy of your time and money.What is Baba is You? Baba is You is a puzzle game. A puzzle game that, as it's custom, consists of you clearing levels that scale in difficulty. Also, in a very Super Mario World way, there are different \"worlds\" with different themes (like, the underwater one, the space one, etc.) that add new elements and features to the mechanics of the game. And that's what this game is all about: its \"meta-mechanics\"! Simply stated, the game consists of pushing blocks in order to reach a certain concealed goal. Now, what makes this new is that some of the blocks are words that refer to elements in the level itself and whose arrangements state the instructions that the elements themselves follow - one of which words being the all so important self-referential 'you'. So, for example, while usually a level begins with 'Baba is you' and 'Flag is win' as being true (and what this entails is that you, as Baba , must reach the Flag), with a few flickering and piling of blocks is possible (and actually the solution to some levels) to maintain that 'Baba is you' while also being that 'Baba is win'. Level completed.Eureka moments such as this, when you realize the way through an impermeable obstacle via simple (but deluding) changes in syntax, are what makes this piece so unique. As someone who's crazy about games that simulate this whole computer science\/programming feeling (like any Zachtronics game does), I must say that Baba Is You depicts the whole idea of how instructions work like no other. Add to this the level of ingenuity the creators put into what (and how) you can modify and the cuteness embedded in all of its pixel-art and minimalistic soundtrack, and you have one of the best puzzle games of all time. I recommend this game to everyone who is into puzzles. From videogame's aficionados to complete beginners to the medium. Yes, it gets really hard (though it is not the steepest curve it has its bumps); but even if you give up halfway, there's no way you won't get a blast out of the whole experience.  (I especially recommend it to any of those brainiacs who still don't take videogames seriously; so if you know any of those,  try recommending this one yourself and see how their opinions change after just a few minutes.) All and all, a unique experience well worth many hours of whacking heads searching for that subtle, almost poetic, line of solution.  [5 stars.]","So much fun!!!","A game of experimentation and rewriting logical statements. Endlessly clever and deserves countless awards. When you think you've figured the game out, there is always something new presented.Do be aware this game gets ridiculously hard very fast. Many puzzles are brutally difficult which will stop some people from enjoying their time here. You will likely hit walls constantly, and feel mentally drained. But in my experience, persevering through hardship is what makes success rewarding.","Oh my god I feel like an idiot","Master-crafted puzzle game, there really isnt better than this. Its also very hard for a smooth-brain like myself but I really enjoy it.","I have never felt simultaneously like a both genius and a complete moron before now.In all seriousness though this is probably my favorite puzzle game of all time, and you'd be doing yourself a disservice to not play it.10\/10","One of the most unique and entertaining puzzle games i've ever played.","Big brain game for big brain gamers","BABA IS YOU.

If the latter is true, look up the soundtrack on YouTube and consider buying that anyhow, the composer behind this little gem did fantastic work.

Every level explores a unique combination of mechanics. Arvi did a great job with focusing on building exceptional puzzles. A lot of them really make you think outside the box, experiment, and just keep trying different things. When you finally solve a really difficult level, it's really satisfying. I also like that you unlock multiple levels at a time so that you can come back later to ones that happen to stump you.  I'm 70+ hours in and still working on unlocking more levels.","What makes a puzzle game good?1. Original puzzle element2. Steady learning curve3. Driving force to solve puzzles1 yes2 a lil3 noOn one of the presentations the devs of Portal hosted, they said that each level should build off of the last. Essentially, you don't give people a mansion and expect them to find their way to the bathroom. There's building blocks that you have to work your way up to there.Even before portal gives you the SINGLE portal portal gun, they make you look at it through the window. At the start of the game they make you go through a portal. There is a single level dedicated to explaining that you don't have to always enter the blue portal. Even before you begin to launch yourself, there are tons of signs on the walls and floor saying that you conserve momentum. There is a crap ton of handholding.The handholding this game gives you is manifested in the level Prison. People say this is the worst level, but it is actually one of the better bits. Basically they trap you in a building with 3 statements, baba is you, keke is push and wall is stop. Because the game does not hold your hand, you could be stuck in this level for 5 hours, give up and feel stupid. But because it doesn't hold your hand, it makes the solution super satisfying. and that is where 3 comes into play.The drive Portal gives you is that you have to escape the facility, learn the lore, and hear the hilarious voicelines. Let's be real, the puzzle solving is only a fraction of the fun. In this game, you have none of that (so far, I don't think I will finish it), but the fact that the puzzles are the sole drive is quite impressive. The fact that this game got me invested for 16 hours is impressive by its self.  5 because it's a mediocre game  1 because it's original+1 because it's one of the only games I own where I don't shoot a gun. (Don't get me wrong, all of the games that score higher than this have a gun. It's just that it proves that a good game doesn't need a gun. Kind of like how Will Smith is that necessary rapper that fills the clean rap void)So for that, I'll give the game a 7\/10","Baba Is You is an absolutely charming brainteaser of a game that continually builds on its seemingly simple mechanics to create truly inventive puzzles that made me think creatively and feel truly accomplished after solving them.","Some megamind sh*t right here.","Write a review for Baba Is YouPlease describe what you liked or disliked about this game and whether you recommend it to others.Please remember to be polite and follow the Rules and Guidelines.","challenging but rewarding","I wish I had it refunded.While the concept of using hard logic is interesting, game only generates frustration instead of fun.The learning curve is so steep you find yourself completly stuck by stage 2.There is a lot of non-logical unwritten rules, such as  if X is both YOU and DEFEAT, it removes X from the level .","Tough but fair!Being tough but fair is what many puzzle games strive to achieve. It is, of course, not easy as it requires a balance between a good challenge and a satisfying reward.This game manages to accomplish this by giving the player fun and surprising solutions after what sometimes feels like an impossible level.5\/5","It's cute! It's mind-bending! I have to leave and come back between every couple of levels to not get stuck and it's obviously not the flashiest game but it is such a cute way to deliver a really good puzzle system. Baba is me! :D","I rarely buy games, since most of the time i spend on playing MMOs. Recently i made a few exceptions and i am glad i made this one. Game's unique quirk of playing around the rules, that are formed by puttting words into sentences in sokoban-like fashion is pretty clever. It makes you feel like you bend the laws of world and forging your own, kinda like cheating, but in a good way, because THIS is gameplay. You HAVE TO cheat on those rules to progress, to win, to not lose objective. The further you dive into game, the more complex rules become and more clever tricks you have to develop to bend environment into your favour. I have to admit that sometimes game does not comunicate well on what you can or cannot do, i can name one specific example but this would be a spoiler on puzzle that is way further into the game. However I really encourage you, dear reader, to figure out the solutions by yourself, since those inconviniences aren't that significant.Game brought me ton of fun and i haven't even figured out half the puzzles. I feel like i'm dumb or something but oh well. Youtube would break the fun of figuring out puzzles on my own :))","This is \"think outside of the box\" the game.The graphics are very simplistic but in this case it's a good thing. The music is there and while not bad, you can mute it since it adds nothing to the game. The basic gameplay concept is unique and easy to understand. That said the difficulty curve rises very quickly and the game becomes hard due to all the possible interactions between the rules and objects.It is very challenging, deceptivelly so even given its cutesy graphics. If you're not used to difficult puzzle games then this game will be unplayable for you so its best to avoid it. But for people who enjoy some tough challenges, and more specifically logic puzzles, this game is quite rewarding. I can safely recommended it!","Very tough, but fun.","I am Confucius.","Outstanding logic puzzle game.

Pros:- Engaging puzzle game- Unique gameplay- Fun ;)","BABA IS GOODREVIEW IS YOU","Cool and interesting puzzle game. COOL AND FUN! I recommend.","Honestly, this game is recommended so much and it really demonstrates why. Unlike most puzzle games where the nature of the puzzle remains static (i.e. you are always moving toward the same goal with the same obstacles), Baba totally puts the nature of the puzzle in the player's hand. This means that the puzzle you start with is not the puzzle you end with in any level which requires a serious kind of creative problem solving which is fantastic.","bdaba...........","Its a good game.the desing is great, the game mechanicks are great, and the puzzels are great.It is all around a great game, and you shoud play it.","GAME IS GOOD JOKE IS OVERUSED","The gameplay loop consists of smoll brain moments followed by big brain moments followed by smoll brain moments followed by big brain moments.","Fun simple and challenging puzzle game.","i like baba. he is soft. thank you for reading","This is a fun little puzzle game, where you manipulate the rules of the puzzle in order to solve them. It's got cute music and simple sprites and has the same puzzle feel Portal does. But sometimes the rules are a bit illogical, which is where I find fault in the game--for example, if \"is float\" is following \"flag\", you can't touch the flag to win if you are not also floating. But if \"text is float\", then you can still push the text, even if you are not floating. Sometimes you can contradict pre-existing rules, sometimes you can't. So there's a bit of trial and error in places where there should be consistent logic--or maybe I'm just really dumb. But I'm enjoying it.

When I finish a level, I always have that \"oooooooh\" moment as everything clicks into place, and the solution is usually weird enough that any novelty outweighs prior frustration. The OST is basic but pleasant, and I usually have a video on in the background anyway. Graphics are quite nice, but I think that the cleaner style seen in the promotional art would have worked better in-game than the pixel art, especially since everything is subject to a wobble effect, which can look a bit noisy with the pixels. However, that's a very minor complaint, and you can actually turn off the wobble in the settings.The difficulty can become rather extreme, and I write this review before completing the whole game because it might be months or years before I whittle it to completion.In all, very good, recommended for any fans of puzzle games.","Fun Puzzle game that may cause your brain to explode from time to time","Don't look at me, play the game already!","One of the best puzzle games I've played. And as someone who like coding and logic puzzles, this is perfect.","To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Baba Is You. The game is extremely hard, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the levels will be uncompletable for a typical player's head. There's also Babas nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily from Sartrean literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these puzzles, to realize that they're not just hard- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Baba Is You truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Baba's existential catchphrase \"Baba Is You,\" which itself is a cryptic reference to Decartes French treatise Discourse on the Method  I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Arvi Teikari's genius unfolds itself on their computer screens. What fools... how I pity them.  And yes by the way, I DO have a Baba Is You tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.","The basic idea is quite simple -- it's yet another of the 10,000 or so iterations of \"push boxes around on a grid\" puzzle game. But the twist this time, that the rules of the puzzle are actually part of the puzzle itself and can be changed by pushing them around the grid, is a complete game-changer. Puzzle difficulty varies from pretty obvious to quite tricky, but all of the puzzles that I've solved so far have been genuinely fun.","Awsome games! but to me its rly hard","Simple mechanics, hard, clever puzzles. Good game.","BRAIN is HURTIt's such a mind-bending delight when you figure out a puzzle. It's made me laugh so many times at the bizarre absurdity and surprise of some of the things you can (and must) do. I've only unlocked half the areas, and I can't wait to see what the others have in store!For a game where you can change the properties of anything (and nothing), you'd think that having so much power would make every level trivial. But quite the opposite. Often you're given very little to work with, and the goal seems impossible, and then you solve it anyway because the universe is insane!It's very good.","Highly recommended","You think you're in some unadulterated fun and have a good time solving puzzles. A few minutes pass by and you question life and how stupid you are.

GONE, the loving family your providing for? GONE, your general well-being? GONE. You'll spend an hour staring at a puzzle gently rocking back and forth murmuring 'Water is Win'.You lose your mind and think the puzzle has no real solution, then you have an epiphany and finally solve the puzzle, The puzzle where you've been staring at water for the last 45 minutes.10\/10 would recommend seeing a health professional after playing","I love this game alot.My \"hours on record\" are not accurate, because i play this alot whilst I'm on flights, in airplane mode.

B.I.Y is a very simple game, and that's it's strength.","SO MUCH THINKING. This is the most elaborate puzzle game I've ever played. The rules of the game itself can be changed to solve obstacles. It feels a lot like programming logic, and having plenty of experience with that I still have quite some difficulty solving some of these puzzles. That said it is a great game and solving the puzzle feels very rewarding.","Yes, I recommend this game. And I love the music.","\"How do I make the most meta game\" is what Arvi Teikari probably asked himself at the 2017 Nordic Game Jam. He then proceeded to develop Baba Is You, a puzzle game in which the game mechanics themselves constitute the puzzle pieces. With its cute aesthetics and simple premise you might think it's a game intended for younger audiences, but you'd be mistaken. Having the power to change the game requires you to think far outside the box, and the increasing number of rules involved can quickly turn it into an intense mental exercise.The level design seems to constantly sketch new scenarios in which your previous experience with the game thus far is useless. Admittedly, this ended up making me Google the solution about 10-15 times, but in my defense, about half of those answers relied heavily on a new game mechanic that I could hardly know about. This, along with the incredibly repetitive music, is my only genuine criticism of the game.One of the most brain breaking puzzle games I've ever played, rivaled only by The Witness. 8\/10","super meta, the video game of video games","Great puzzles & easy to understand rules. It doesn't hurt that the soundtrack is bangin too.","Talking about the game without spoiling it is hard, therefore I just recommend you playing it if you like puzzle games.","I don't like that fact that on later puzzles you can push stuff that would allow you to win (e.g. level fall-2 grand stream can put together keke is key) which would allow you to solve the puzzle but when you put them together it well just block out the answer. the game is all about out thinking the game to solve the puzzle, so when you out think the game and the game does not allow it, its just not fun.","Baba Is Good","Such a simple idea for puzzles and yet the applications are incredibly complex.

The puzzles are limited only by the imagination.Super game, my brain hurts","ME IS DUMBPUZZLE WRECKS BRAINGAME IS GOOD","Baba is You Is one of the better puzzle games that exists. The mechanics are interesting, puzzles themselves are challenging and fun, and most importantly it gives you that feeling of satisfaction when you finally understand a puzzle and solve it. I personally have spent about 15 hours on this game (if you combine the play time I have on the switch) and I thoroughly enjoy it. However be warned the puzzles get incredibly hard and can be very frustrating. I personally have not played the game in quite some time just simply because I'm stuck on literally every single puzzle that I have available.8\/10","GAME is GOOD","The concept of a puzzle game where you have to change the rules of the level to solve it is such a unique concept and Baba Is You does it so well. I recommend this game but there's a big caveat to it. This is a not a casual game to relax with. The difficulty doesn't ramp up in a progressively more challenging way. Early levels in some worlds are more difficult to figure out than later ones that are supposed to be more challenging. You could spend 40 minutes on one level and the next two could take five minutes. The game also introduces new rules into levels and you NEED to do a lot of trial and error to learn everything you can do with that rule, and how exactly they work when you make those rules. If you can't figure out how or why certain rules are causing different effects, levels are going to take an abnormal amount of time to solve. One example with me was a level that let you make the rule  EMPTY IS YOU . It isn't clear how that rule moves because it can end up getting stuck after a while and it isn't allowed to move anymore, but before that it's totally fine.Watch some people play the game first to see just how long it can take someone to figure out the puzzles in this game. They're amazing puzzles but man can they take forever to figure out how to make progress in them. The game will give you your \"aha!\" moments but even when it does, sometimes you won't understand why what you did to solve the puzzle even worked to begin with.","play this, thnaks","brain hurty","Game Is Good","Simple concept for puzzles with great depth.

The game won't help you with the level tips, but generally they arranged the way you can already find out the solution. Also often solving one puzzle gives you an idea of the others which unblocks you and let play further. I was able to reach all Steam achievements without any clue! Often you will be stuck for days, and then suddenly wake up in the morning with the solution :P This is a game for a month at least, don't think you will finish it quickly - sometimes you will be stuck for long and also.. there are actually more levels than you expect.There is no map editor and I felt sad because if that, but after playing it for more.. it's probably not needed. There are a lot of prepared levels to do, you will have enough of puzzles to think about :P I also have an idea for many extra levels, but well.. the game is already difficult sufficiently xD.Solving every single level will award you with a great feeling, coming back to try again is worth.You will be stuck many times for sure - when you are clueless I recommend to just play around on the level, test the sentences if they are working fully the way you expect, do some random stupid stuff - you can get some ideas or find something out that way too :D And often the best is to just take a break, come back later with a fresh mind and start analyzing from the begining.Good luck!","Hardest puzzle game I've played, it really is a mind and a very original concept.

A simple premise that quickly turns challenging and will require you to think out of the box often, or maybe even become the box itself!Sometimes you'll need to transform yourself into other objects, or obstacles into other objects, or switch the win condition of the level, but how? You see, when Baba pushes objects, they might spell out a phrase that modifies whatever the phrase describes. For example, you start with \"Flag is Win\", so touching the flag will lead you to victory. But maybe the flag is unreachable, and the only phrase you can make is 'Baba is Win', therefore switching the condition to your specific needs. You might even need to turn Baba into the level itself in order to accomplish your goal!With it's ever increasing level of difficulty, Baba is You is a masterclass on how to make a simple game right, one that will wring your brain for hours and will make you feel many 'big brain' moments when you conquer its many puzzles.If you enjoy deceptively simple puzzle games made with passion and a penchant for unconventional thinking, Baba is you is guaranteed to entertain you for hours on end and will feel immensely rewarding when you complete it.

Like all hard puzzle games, its hard [citation needed] so if you want a nice puzzle adventure about changing rules don't get it. Baba is you is ridiculously hard with very limited hand-holding. You might think of yourself as a puzzle genius, but I'd suggest looking up one or two puzzles in advance to glean the difficulty a bit. This might be gamer sacrilege but, seriously, I can't stress this enough, it's very, very, very, extremely, stupidly hard","jhg","I played this game past midnight on my hall resident's switch in college last semester.

Also many of the more complex levels will require you to think outside of the box to beat them otherwise get ready to get stuck a lot at first.

Definitely the best puzzle game I have ever played so far.","A fun puzzle game. (Perhaps a tad pricey though - try to get it on sale.)Basically the word blocks control how the environment behaves.E.g.\"WALL IS STOP\" means the wall is solid so nothing can go through it.\"FLAG IS WIN\" means that touching the flag will complete the level.To complete levels you often have to shuffle the words around to change how things behave.E.g. if you were stuck inside a box of walls and the flag was outside but you could get to the \"WALL IS STOP\" blocks you could move the words out of alignment so the walls would no longer be solid and you could then walk through them to get to the flag.It seems simple enough but the rules give rise to some very complex puzzles because your access to the words is often limited by obstacles.I'm actually surprised nobody thought of this before.It reminds me of certain esoteric programming languages that run on a 2D grid of characters.","Innovative puzzle game that gets quite hard.","awesome.","Baba is You is a super unique puzzler where you must change the rules of the level in order to beat it.

As somebody noted, despite this being the game about thinking out of the box, this is also a game about thinking inside the developer's box. This leads to some levels having incredibly convoluted solutions, and some prohibiting the same complexity in favor of more streamlined formula. And you can never guess which is which, so I found myself being stuck because I was overestimating or underestimating how complicated the puzzle was, not because it was any difficult.Don't get me wrong, the game is absolutely brilliant, and I love it dearly. However, the complexity rollecoaster is very annoying, especially late into the game. If you have little patience, this is definitely not a game for you.","This game is ridiculously challenging yet so much fun. My hours are probably inflated by 15-20 hours because I left the game on, but that is still 70+ hours of gameplay. I've still got the last world to complete too.

Well, here you'll have to!This is a great puzzle game with a truly unique concept, where you manipulate both objects AND rulesets which make them what they are. The rules are extremely intuitive - although you sometimes have to experiment a little to decipher their childish grammar. Like, \"door is shut\" means exactly that, but \"key is open\" means \"key can be used to open anything that is shut\". Each \"area\" in the game starts out easy, allowing you to experiment and get used to all the new elements it introduces (objects, rules, keywords like \"and\" or \"has\", or simply new ways of using what you've already seen). And then it gives you some REAL puzzles.And the best part is how crazy the solutions are, since you can literally change anything as long as the setup includes rule keywords to do it! Sure, some rules are often fixed by putting their words someplace you can't push them around, but even that sometimes is a clever deception (I've already encountered a puzzle which required me to disable a rule which seemed fixed at first).A definite must-play if a puzzle game is what you are looking for right now.","Very enjoyable puzzle game.","Ever wanted to change the rules to solve a puzzle?

Plus I love how  Meta the game gets towards the end. *chefs kiss*","This game uses one simple mechanic and extends it to create the most brain-activating scenarios. That's a boon in any game, but especially so for a puzzle game. Streaming this for a few of my friends was fun for them to watch. The graphics fit the nature of the game well. In terms of difficulty, it scales appropriately. After a few worlds, I began to feel hopelessly lost in most levels, but I know that if I go back to them, they'll seem incredibly easy. I have not completed the game yet (and honestly haven't played it for about a month now because of work and other games), but it's something I plan on going back to.","Very mindbending, very epic","Brain malfunction","By far one of the best puzzle games I have payed in a while. You cant get better than this in difficulty and enjoyment. (ok maybe snakebird is pretty high there as well)","[game] on [pc] is [good] and [fun] and not [bad]","The hardest puzzle game I've played.","the game has a fantastic concept, i'm just too dumb to figure it out","This may just be my favorite puzzle game ever. I'm typically not very good at picking favorites, but this game is a strong contender. I'm pretty sure you know what the gimmick is, but if for some reason you haven't and you're reading this review, Baba Is You is a game about changing its own rules. The rules are physical words that you can push around, and doing this allows you to change the way the world works. \"WALL IS STOP\"? Just separate the words to literally \"break\" the rule. Now you can walk through walls. You can also put together words to create your own rules, which is how you'll be solving many of the levels.Many levels have rules that can't be broken in order to preserve the challenge, but there's a lot you can do with this gimmick, and Baba Is You will blow your mind again and again with each new type of rule it introduces, allowing you to do things you may not have thought would be possible. The level design does a good job of teaching you new gameplay mechanics without long-winded tutorials and explanations, and the later levels will really test your critical thinking skills. Some of them have more than one possible solution.I highly recommend playing this game without looking at spoilers, because there are some big \"woah\" moments that just won't have the same impact when you read about them instead of experiencing them ingame. There's even an official level editor on its way, but even without the level editor this game is worth playing. As a matter of fact, once the level editor update comes out, I'd advise not messing around with it until you've played through the main game first, because it will spoil a lot of those \"woah\" moments I was talking about. Can't think of anything else I want to say, so I'll just add one bit of advice if you plan on playing it: Don't feel obligated to 100% the game before clearing \"A Way Out?\". I'm not going to explain why, I just think it's for the best.","Completely mind bending puzzle game. It's rare to play something that constantly has you thinking outside of the box.

I should've looked into it more than I did, but I've been trying to expand my horizons and I thought this would be a nice introduction to the puzzle genre. It makes a great puzzle game, and if you are into that, go ahead and buy it. I'm giving it a thumbs up to rely that information, I'm not going to down vote it because it doesn't fit my tastes. Just a caution to others - don't fall into the same trap I did. I saw the 98% positive, and jumped at the chance to buy it. If you don't like puzzle games, this isn't the one for you.

The difficulty ramps up at a good rate but there were quite a few times, notably when I'd put the game down for a day or two before resuming, when a mechanic made no sense to me and I was stuck on a puzzle, e.g. some of the bonus MOVE puzzles. I love the way the game explores grammar and squeezes every ounce of meaning from each word. Personally I found some of the puzzles too hard but with enough time I think they're within reach!The character design and artwork is minimal but super cute.

I thought I had tried it but I must not have.

Please localize it!).","While the puzzle genre is alive and ever-expanding, it's very rare to come upon a game that challenges you on such a non-intuitive level as this game does.Baba Is You combines simple Sokoban-style puzzles with linguistic rules, allowing you to alter the properties of objects in a level.

It's the kind that sticks with you, even once you've shut the game down, meaning you're always kind of thinking about how to solve the puzzles. A true masterpiece.","Baba is You is hard, I'm not going to lie. It's essentially all spatial reasoning, and finding clever ways to arrange things so that they interact with the other objects at exactly the right time or in exactly the right place. Spatial reasoning is not my strong suit. However, although I may not be good at this game, I absolutely appreciate how amazing it is.First of all, the unique word puzzle\/block puzzle format this game presents is unlike any other I've come across before, and the way the words can interact in pretty much any form and the limits that those interactions place on the world are so unique and interesting. If nothing else, buy Baba is You just to witness how it works. It's truly mind-boggling, but that comes with the added perk of feeling really, really smart when you solve a puzzle.Second of all, the graphics, music, and sound effects are incredibly cute. The game is all 2-D, with some interesting elements added later (I won't mention what they are, though- buy the game!). Pretty much every element is rendered in a cute, rounded, solid-color style that is just so pleasant to look at. The music is cute, light, and perfectly sets the mood to keep from getting frustrated.As for frustration, like I said, Baba is You is a hard game. I'm biased, but I have several friends who've also played it, and they agree with me: it's far from easy. But the vast majority of the puzzles in this game are just on the right side of toothsomely difficult, rather than frustrating. They invoke thought in a way I haven't found any other game to do- a product of the game's unique block-word interface yet again- and encourage experimentation, trial and error, and quite literally thinking out of the block. I cannot recommend this game enough.","Good","Very unique puzzle solving. Haven't played a puzzle game this good since Portal.

You will spend hours figuring out a level only to learn that nothing you did will carry over to the next stage. You are constantly starting from ground zero, with no breaks whatsoever. Each world's structure is essentially:- Introduce new mechanics in a few levels at the start- Complex levels that ask you to reverse engineer the mechanics you just learned- Bonus levels that completely flip the new mechanics on their head with pre-existing level layouts, just with slightly different block placement, forcing you to start from scratch (very frustrating)If you're supposed to blindly reverse engineer solutions to the levels until you stumble across the answer, that isn't good puzzle design. That's just a frustrating waste of my time.","god i'm so  ANGRY why is this game so GOOD???? i had high expectations after watching the trailer and it was still even better than i expected. there are so many cool interactions to mess around and figure out and just when you think you've seen it all, BOOM the game takes a massive  on your head (in a good way). 10\/10 this is puzzle game perfection","Creative","One of the best puzzle game I have ever played!100% recommended","Baba is You is a fantastic and really challenging mind game.

Good puzzles. Makes you feel smrt.","Preamble : For the love of god buy it if you like hard but creative puzzle games :Baba is you is an amazing puzzle game with great complexity that thoroughly explores its core design space of sokoban+logic puzzles, has a beautiful cutesy presentation, that doesn't waste your time and demands mastery from the player. The steep difficulty curve of the game coupled with its unwillingness to comprise on any challenge means it is aimed more towards tenacious and adept puzzle solver types. If this does not in some way describe you you are likely to grow frustrated with the game despite it's gleeful presentation and the creativity of most of the puzzles. For puzzle fans that like a challenge Baba is you is a steal and should not be skipped.Meanderings on the good: Minor gameplay spoilers ahead :The puzzles in baba is you are presented as a mixture of traditional sokoban puzzles as well as a unique \"binary rule\" system where in which the player can form sentences to affect the state and properties of game elements. The link between the two is that all game elements as well as all of the words that form the rules are sokoban blocks, which allows for relatively tight integration of the two and that comes together to form a system that is outwardly simple yet internally intricate. The sokoban aspect limits the variety of rules that can be formed by the player in an organic way which makes the rule side of things manageable in scope and intricate without bloating the board with rules that are only there to limit player actions. Restrictiveness in player action that misdirects from the true solution is the mark of a good puzzle, and this is one of the ways baba is you achieves it. This philosophy of not increasing difficulty by overwhelming the player with the sheer size of a problem (as many older puzzle games do) resonates throughout the game design of baba is you. All of the puzzles appear deceptively simple and are quick to parse yet they are unmistakably difficult. Most exude a flavour of difficulty that can only be described as requiring \"out of the box thinking\". It is truly remarkable that most puzzles in the game fall in this category of puzzle, which one would think would be reserved for a \"best\" and most creative minority of the puzzles. There is very little reuse and recycling of ideas, the challenge comes from deepening your understanding of the core sokoban\/rule system it's edge cases and peculiarities, the periodic addition of new rules for fresh challenges and a steady increase in abstraction. All this I feel is a testament to the high quality of the game and the reason it is likely to be well liked by puzzle enthusiasts. Meanderings on the questionable: minor spoilers ahead:Previously I mentioned that there is little reuse of ideas, one could also take this to mean that there is little progression on the core concepts of baba is you. I believe this realization is mostly correct however in the previous section I've also layed out some of the ways in which baba is you subverts this issue. Still I think this fact does lend a somewhat tiresome\/repetitive nature to the game since the player will effectively be doing relatively similar block puzzles from start to finish. Personally I don't think that the game overstays its welcome in this regard but the limitations do start to show as your level clear tally enters the triple digits. The last point on Baba is you's game design I want to discuss is a possible overeliance on edge cases and obtuse mechanics as the pay off to challenges. Although the rules are 100% consistent throughout the game I cannot help but feel certain peculiarities of the game system such as stacking impassable objects is perhaps overexploited to manufacture creative solutions. This is really the dark side of the \"the game is outwardly simple but somehow ultimately complex\" remark. If the game IS too simple to craft meaningful puzzles and unwilling to bloat the design space with many moving parts then exploration of obscure edge cases is almost a requirement. One of the frustration with these edge case based solutions is that they are often cumbersome to realize and hence difficult for the player to internalize, here the limitation of the sokoban system is perhaps a downfall; as the prerequisites for certain behaviours increase (e.g. synchronicity, multiple agents acting at once, rules flipping in and out at the exact right moment etc.)  it becomes increasingly tedious to experiment. I am not sure if ultimately this is a personal problem or a problem with the game but it is something that I felt progressing into the endgame that I felt was worth mentioning.  It is also not fair to say that \"out of the box\" is inherently obscure, many solutions\/twists also fall in the \"hiding in plain sight\" category but of course these are uniquely satisfying in part because the novelty can only be experienced once; these cannot reasonably comprise the bulk of the content.Overall this is a game worth playing, it really has no glaring flaws and you may well disagree with what few issues I have listed in the previous section. Even if you are not particularly fond of hard puzzle games I suspect that the game is tightly designed enough that you may well enjoy the beginning of the game which is a little bit easier and less reliant on semi-obtuse solutions. In this case I think having \"too much game\" is a quality problem to have.","Very clever","I absolutely love the puzzles in this game.Very unique mechanics, and the solutions for puzzles are really creative.If you're looking for a fun mind-melting puzzle game then Baba is You is the game for you.","one of the most amazing concepts for a puzzle game","brain hurtssomuch","The best puzzle game I've played in the past 10 years bar none.","get it","Dumbass is Me","I always feel the sign of a good game is when I can look up at the clock and be surprised how much time has passed.

I have spent hours on a leveling trying to make my idea work only to realize I was doing something completely wrong and that the real solution was much simpler.

That said, it is supremely satisfying at all levels and well worth it even if you don't finish it.Baba Is You is clever. Very clever. Maybe too clever.The basic premise is simple to understand: you move around and push and pull objects. Included among those objects is the very rules of the puzzle like who you control, what keys do, what you can push etc.Each puzzle comes up with a clever way to utilize this premise. You will have many awesome ah-HA! moments throughout your play time. However, a lot of lateral thinking is required. And you will hit a wall sooner or later. I have enjoyed many puzzle games, and most I try and play to the end, but I found in this game I was hitting walls more and more often, and just getting stuck. I like puzzling things out but the game is very dependent on interlocking mechanics so there usually are no steps to tide you over during a puzzle... its basically all or nothing. So you will eventually find yourself sitting there, puzzling and puzzling, with nothing working and the game will reward your effort with nothing until you solve it all the way. Basically I eventually found the game a bit too hard and bit overwhelming. Entering levels with like 8 different rules elicited an audible groan from me. I don't think I am bad a puzzle games but maybe I am just bad at this puzzle game. Whatever the reason, I did eventually quit before finishing it.That said the time I did spend with it was well worth it.While puzzle games live and die by their gameplay, I did also want to say that even though the visual style does a have certain charm, I didn't like it much. The sound design I equally didn't care for.

However some parts aren't perfect.GAMEPLAY:Its a basic game where you push stuff around, however, that's the perfect style for this game. my only complaint is that if you have to pull an object the controls get a little annoying.DIFFICULTY:Difficulty wise this game is strange. one level could be ridiculously easy and the next one incredibly hard, just something to look out for. basically, the worlds are grouped by a specific mechanic and not difficulty, and the level numbers basically mean nothing, level 15 could be easier than level 7 (i would suggest doing a whole \"island\" of levels at a time rather than in numerical order)PUZZLE DESIGN:This is also odd. BIY has some of my favourite puzzles of any game that exists, but also some disappointing ones. This is partly because some levels have an obvious end goal, and others just give you a ton of info to sort out, which isn't always bad but not good either. however the levels which are good in this game (most of them actually) are really good, and incredibly rewarding to complete.MECHANICS:the way gameplay mechanics are introduced are in form of new types of block (example, making something MOVE, or PUSH, or SINK). This game does a pretty good job at showing you what blocks do. It doesn't make you guess what things do, but it also doesn't tell you, it sort of goes \"mess around with this thing\" which then leads you into the main puzzles. My only complaint is that some mechanics are only used in like 5 levels and then never again (looking at you, GROUP), but the level editor should open up more opportunities for these mechanics.So to finish off, amazing game with a beautiful mechanic and art style but possibly not one you would want to get 100% completion in, unless you like ridiculously hard puzzles (just for reference one level took youtuber Aliensrock the most part of 3 hours to complete)","good solve","Gameplay- Very good Good Nothing special Okay BadGraphics- Masterpiece Beautiful Good Will do Bad AwfulAudio Amazing Very good Good Decent Not too bad BadAudience Kids Teens Adults EveryoneStory- Lovely Good Average Not great NoneDifficult- Just press a bunch of buttons Easy Significant brain usage Easy to learn \/ Hard to master Not so easy Difficult Dark SoulsGrind- Nothing Only if you care about leaderboards\/ranks Isnt necessary to progress A bit grindy sometimes Average grind level Too much grind InsanityGame Time- Short Average Long Depends on you EndlessPrice Just buy it Worth the price Wait for sale Maybe if you have some spare money left Not recommended","Baba is You is a very interesting twist to the puzzle game genre.

I really wasn't sure what to expect when I first heard about this game. I needed to do a lot of research to get a feel for what the gameplay consists of exactly, but once I decided to take a chance I was very glad I did so. In Baba Is You, the objective of each level is to reach the flag (or any object paired with \"is win\") by pushing blocks made up of a single word each to form sentences. It can be difficult to explain the nuances of the game without seeing it in action, but the game does a fantastic job of explaining its basic concept through the first few levels. The stages within each world get progressively more challenging, but fortunately, you're almost always sure to have beaten enough stages to unlock another world before feeling stuck, so you can bounce between a few different areas of the game as you think about any puzzles you're stuck on. That amount of freedom is helpful, because I often found myself really wanting to solve a puzzle I was stuck on, even after multiple tries, and only looked up solutions when I felt I ran out of options that I could come up with myself. This is to the game's credit, it makes you feel clever for solving its puzzles and sometimes even for trying different combinations of words to see how they will affect the objects you're given to work with. The only thing I would say is a negative about Baba Is You is that the mechanics of some words presented later in the game can feel a bit obtuse, even after completing the first level or two of the world that uses them. Once you get the hang of them though, the puzzles are still great and worth sitting with and giving the time to think about if you need to, so I encourage you to not get frustrated by any of the game's most tricky stages but give yourself a chance to work it out. It can be very satisfying to look at the tools you're given in any level and think about how the different words can be used to interact with each other and Baba Is You never makes trial and error feel like a chore.  If you enjoy puzzle games with a unique premise and clever design I highly recommend Baba Is You.

The game is fantastic. At full price you won't regret this one. It's a turn-based puzzler, and I don't like turn based anything for the most part. It even has an undo button and a restart button. But that description undersells it because this is by no means your average standard game.It's very cute and the other reviews are basically correct in that the way the game is set up is funny and not just \"for da memes\", which the other reviews make it look like. I don't like memes at all but I get where they are coming from, and they are right. The thing is, the puzzles are very intelligent and train you to think differently for different puzzles. They don't always order in terms of difficulty, but that ends up being fine, because once you solve a difficult puzzle, if the next 3 puzzles are relatively easy, it's a breath of fresh air you'll find that you'll need. The puzzles become unforgivingly difficult.Once you play this, you will understand as well, and you will love the game for the way it presents itself and plays.","it took me 2 years...yeah pretty ez ngl maybe make them a challenge next time 9\/10","One of the most original (and hard) puzzle games I've tried, on pair with The Witness or Braid.","closest feeling to \"thinking with portals\" i've had in a long time.","Nice Baba.","Baba","While the game has simple rules, the puzzles are not.

When you ponder a puzzle for 5 minutes and then finally crack the mystery, it is an extremely satisfying feeling. However, I found at later levels, some puzzles were taking me 20 or even 30+ minutes to solve, and that level of difficulty is a bit too much for me to find fun.Highly recommended for admirers of clever design, and hardcore puzzle solvers. To everyone else, try it out: if you're finding things a little too frustrating at 2 hours, I would advise that it's not going to get better as you progress further.","BABA is YOU isn't just a game, it's a journey.

You push around blocks with text to change the rules of the game. It's programmatically easy to understand, yet even late game I'm finding surprising interactions between different elements. It really teaches you to question the assumptions you make - I often start out thinking a level is impossible, and then going carefully through my chain of reasoning realize which step is false. It has a programming \"feel\" to it - and it certainly has that Turing-completeness - but it's not at all like the games which are a game UI slapped on top of a simple programming language. And it is so META.It really brought me back to the days when I did math contests, when I would keep thinking about problems away from the desk and suddenly have an \"aha!\" moment. It takes a really good puzzle game to be intuitive and difficult enough so that you can keep thinking about it as you go about your day and possibly suddenly solve it in the shower.","This is a pretty hard puzzle game.

The progression of difficulty generally feels good and as things start to get challenging, it feels gratifying to figure out that tough solve.However, I can't honestly recommend playing it until completion unless you start consulting a walkthrough for the last areas. A lot of the puzzles started feeling absurdly difficult and abstract. Maybe other people are better at this game than me. Maybe I was starting to get a little burnt out on playing time (this is a very long game). But it was just too frustrating for me at the end without a walkthrough for some of those levels. Honestly I don't even feel like the walkthrough took away from the experience of the completion of this game. It was still interesting to see all the crazy level designs and ideas!The bottom line is definitely pick the game up and try it out if it looks appealing. You'll enjoy it.

As with a few friends and me, we all got stuck at various points and eventually stopped playing; there just was no point reading up the solutions online. Of course, some mini in-game hints would have helped us a lot.

What could make this purchase not a recommendation for you is that you need to change your mindset to something you're simply not wired in your head to do.Detailed Review Follows:BABA IS YOU is a hard game to describe, and that might be my failing in not continuing with this game. It's basically a puzzle game where you, an animal named BABA (a sheep?) is tasked to solve a problem presented, but you can change the rules of the universe you are in to solve it. That might seem simple to do, since that implies omnipotence, but if you don't understand what the rules are in the first place, impotency in trying to change them is more likely the outcome. You have to learn by trial and error.You are basically given just two things as the foundation to start your attempts from:* You can move horizontally and vertically but not diagonally.* You can change the rules that govern BABA's universe by moving words to form certain phrases, but you're not told the syntax. You have to guess what that is. Imagine being told you have to learn your native language not by going to school but simply fumbling about through trial and error. Guessing. Yes, you could do that but it would take considerably longer than simply being told up front the correct symbols to use in writing, and the correct phonetics to utter in speaking. BABA does not explain to you the entire syntax of the rules of the universe he (I'm assuming BABA's a he) wanders around in his attempts to solve the puzzle he's stuck in. You need to know not only the correct order to put text in, but also the valid directions to be in. Up to the point I quit in frustration, I learned the following.[NOUN] IS [PRONOUN\/ADVERB][NOUN]IS[PRONOUN\/ADVERB]          [NOUN][NOUN] IS [PRONOUN\/ADVERB]    [PRONOUN\/ADVERB]I'm sure there are other universe defining syntax and directions to use, but it's not being explained and to me, in any game, and as I stated in my review of Silicon Zeroes, it is important to be taught the game mechanics up front before playing any game. You shouldn't have to use the Monkey writing Shakespeare theorem (which states given an infinite amount of time and food, even a monkey can write a work of Shakespeare) in order to understand the rules of any game. State everything up front, then let the player go solve the puzzle. This does not make BABA IS YOU A terrible game. It has overwhelmingly positive reviews. It won awards for being a very special kind of game that bucks the trend. What makes me give it a bad review is that it asks you, rather unfairly and as a player in a forum post said to me when I had a problem with a puzzle, to let go of what you know and view the world in a completely foreign alien way. I can't work that way.  I expect the world I live in to operate in a certain way and I work within the paradigm of that structure to exist. I cannot flip it around to make it work for me, particularly where I don't even understand how that world works in the first place.","Not much to say that hasn't been said in the many thousands of positive reviews so far. It's clever, fun, mind-bending, cute, and one of those games that just works universally. Show a little kid, show your grandma, show someone from a place you've never heard of who's just getting into games.BABA IS YOUBABA IS MEBABA IS ALLALL IS BABA","This game is hard","Actual best puzzle game"],["One of the most fun and interesting puzzle game I've played in a while.

Buy it if you like challenging puzzle games.","BABA IS GOOD","Game is Good","Amazing.Also incredibly hard.","(Review far prior to finishing the game!)What is \"Baba Is You\"?\"Baba Is You\" is the most innovative game of 2019. Behind the facade of DOS-era graphics waits a cleverly designed puzzle game that has only a few fixed rules, while all others can be changed by the player. Moving the playable character(s) on a grid, the player can interact with objects, including the text that gives the rules for a level.One of the rules - that obviously can be changed - is the tile of the game: Baba Is You. Seemingly impossible puzzles can be solved by doing stuff that is outright hilarious but always extremely clever. You are Baba, but you don't have to be. Sort the text correctly: Wall is You. Yes, now you control all walls - but not Baba anymore.Flag is Win. But you can't reach the flag? Just set any other object to win. Even the one you control.The only limitations come from the level design, the dev there really made great puzzles, but in a few cases unnecessarily annoying or complicated. However, most of the time the experience is very enjoyable. Sadly, I can only write a pre-review, as I did not get far through the game. With only ten hours in, I did solve a few worlds.Apropos solving: The game never is unfair. You can undo moves or restart the level at any point. When there is an unintended solution, the dev usually patches it out - except in early levels where you learn the game and might find solutions that are more complicated than the one that was intended.The level editor by now has entered the open beta, and apparently now everyone can create own levels. So there is even more content after the game is finished. Will it reach the quality of the official levels? Well, there were dedicated players who used the dev's level editor before it went to open beta, it was undocumented available. So level sets exist already that are by dedicated people and that hold themselves to high standards. So the game never truly is completed for a player.The game is controlled entirely by keyboard or controller, and thanks to the undo function mistakes aren't an issue.The music and sound are fitting.In an era where many games build on well-established ideas, \"Baba Is You\" manages to create something innovative, something that at least I had never seen before. Giving the player near total control of the level leads to incredible results, but all the while that control might not bring him closer to the simple target - get the player and the victory condition together.Baba Is You?

Super fun to dive into until you start hitting the first walls. One day I will return and try tearing them down again!","GAME IS GOOD AND HARDI IS IDIOTGAME HAS I","Most of the negative reviews on this game have two main points:1) It's too hard, or better worded, the difficulty curve has a huge wall pretty early on2) There's only one intended solution, so it's not really thinking outside the box, more of thinking inside the developer's box.I'm going to try and explain my views on these matters.First off, the difficulty curve. There are certainly some very hard levels even in the first few worlds. In my opinion, though, that's on purpose - as you play the game more and become more accustomed to the way of thinking it requires, those levels start to get easier. You can always get the required amount of levels to \"beat\" the world without completing those really hard ones, so I'd argue that they're designed to be something akin to those really hard enemies in the early areas of Dark Souls - if you manage to beat them then congrats, go on ahead, but it would be wise to try again when you're a bit better at the game.The second one is a bit harder to talk about without using graphical aid. But to put it simply, I don't believe the people who are using the \"outside the box\" description really know what that means in terms of the average puzzle game.Most people, when they think of \"thinking outside the box\", they think of something like the Hitman games - you can do just about anything to accomplish your goal, no matter how absurd it is. Of course it has a limit, no video game could accurately account for and program in the truly insane ideas humanity has, but for the most part a lot of the things you try will work as long as you have the skill to pull it off.If you applied that to Baba Is You, where whatever you try would probably work, it would be a very, very boring game. Most puzzle games have to limit themselves to one solution - that's usually where the challenge comes in. You need to find a solution by trying things, and thinking about what happened when you tried what you did, and devising a new plan with what you've now learned. BIY is less about the execution of the level, and more about the concept of the level. There's almost always one solution. But I never have felt like I was truly stumped - I've always had more ideas on how to go about the level.BIY is a hard game. It's challenging, it makes you think a lot. I like that in a game. If you don't, I'd say save your money. But in my opinion this is the best puzzle game ever made.","Game is fun","Best puzzle game.","BABE IS CUTEGAME IS GOODBUY IS WORTH","10\/10 amazing game.","its ok","boop boop","annoying","i like this game but im too dumb to sovle the puzzles :((","baba is youpuzzle is goodgame is fun and hard","baba is youbaba is funbaba is happy","dis gayme hard i go see kentuckey fried man. giv me refun","i like it fun puzzle and good design","good puzzle","game is good","This is the coolest puzzle game I've played in a very long time!

It does a good job of easing you into the puzzle mechanics, and has a fairly steady ramp in difficulty.

The goal of the game is to manipulate rules in a way tha enables you getting to \"win\" object or you are the winning object.

Sound design is exceptional, and pops up in my head more than a year after playing it. The vibe of this game is strong and wonderful","This is one of the most creative puzzle games I've ever played. Puzzles are basically equal parts frustrating and satisfying. The logic system in the game is mostly intuitive but the combinations make it impressively broad in application.My main criticism (other than that the designer is clearly much smarter than I am :P ) is that some of the solutions in later puzzles feel frustratingly narrow. Early puzzles give you multiple solutions, or at least fairly clear solutions, whereas a lot of the later puzzles have very specific, sometimes convoluted methods where any alternative solutions are blocked off by extra rules.That said, this game is well worth the price and I think anyone who likes block puzzle games should give it a shot.","I'm not sure what happened, but I started this game at 11PM, played for an hour, and then it was 4AM so I went to sleep and started dreaming about solutions to the level I was stuck onI think this is one of those mind virus games from, like, Star Trek or something. But it's probably still worth playing even if it does end up destroying civilization by taking over our brains - these puzzles are really goodIf you're the sort of person who likes puzzle games, I'm sure you'll enjoy this. Just expect some confusion and frustration as you figure out the nuance of the mechanics.I also have to compliment the music and art. Both are simple, but extremely enjoyable.

A sokoban-style puzzle game where text commands in the form of pushable blocks make up the rules! The sheer number of different commands available results in a nigh-infinite variety of puzzles. Truly a brilliant concept that is even more brilliantly executed! Unlike most sokoban-style games, the real challenge comes from forming the right rules and using them to your advantage, rather than maneuvering through tight spaces. While the aspect of working through spaces is still there, it is not that difficult on its own, though when combined with the aspect of rule-bending, it can really drive you insane! It should be noted that some of the text blocks are sealed away in impenetrable walls, so there are some rules that cannot be changed for each level!I dare say that this is one of the most unique games ever! Plenty of levels to keep you occupied for a while, too! Yes, it is brutally challenging, but it's difficult in the way that you really have to think outside the box in order to solve the puzzles, rather than requiring a ungodly number of steps. Really makes you feel like a genius whenever you solve a puzzle! Worth every penny!I should also mention that there is a level editor, which means there are plenty of community-made custom levels available out there for you to try if you somehow manage to complete all 200+ levels of the base game! The fun never ends!Update 1 (10 Aug 2021): I think it's worth mentioning that I have yet to complete the game, though I have sort of 'beaten' it. I'm around 70% through right now, and I definitely plan to finish it one day, but the puzzles have gotten so fiendishly difficult that my progress is pretty much stagnant right now. I still attempt a few levels time to time, and occasionally even make a breakthrough, like I just did today, but I doubt I'd be able to finish it this year. I could always use walkthroughs or hints if I wanted to, but I'm against looking up solutions for puzzle games, and I highly suggest everyone not to do so as you'd just be cheating yourself out of experiencing the 'Eureka' moment of having solved a difficult puzzle on your own!

As always with puzzle games, I only have one piece of advice: no matter how tempted you may be, no matter how impossible you may think a level is, do NOT look up any hints. Believe me, I have solved every puzzle in this game (if you don't believe me, look at my achievements, I've done it). If you think a puzzle is tough, leave it and come back to it.

It's extremely difficult to articulate what I like about. But, I'm giving it a thumbs-up, so I have to try my best.At its core, Baba Is You is just a block-pusher puzzle game. But of course, the twist is all in the word-based rules thing. The trailers explain better than I could, and they left me with only one question: \"Is this as good as it looks, or is it a cool concept they do nothing with?\" After over a dozen hours, I think I can safely say it is as good as it looks.The sheer amount of things you can do is staggering to behold. Nothing will ever amuse me quite the same as filling the whole screen with Babas, or becoming the walls, or becoming powerful enough to eat lava. I highly recommend playing around with any level that lets you do so; solving puzzles is fun, but messing around is even moreso.My only complaint with Baba Is You is that it's a little cruel at times. New concepts are introduced at breakneck pace, which can make it feel like a game that's way too big-brain for the average player. A few intermediary levels, to help ease the player into the trickier bits, would've been nice.I'd advise playing Baba Is You with some friends, so you can all be frustrated together. Solving puzzles on my own feels like an impossible feat, but it all just gets so much easier when there's someone else to bounce ideas off of.Either way, Baba Is You is highly recommended for anyone with the patience to suffer through the frustration. If anything in the trailers looks at all interesting to you, Baba Is You is well worth your time.EDIT: Playing just a little further, I'm finding a lot of levels that rely on understanding game mechanics that can't reasonably be understood without outside assistance. This game really needs a better tutorial, or better paced puzzles. I still think it's worth playing, for the parts that are really good. But I take no shame looking up the answers to some of these later puzzles, and I advise you to feel no shame either.","Brain is hurt","Admittedly, I haven't finished the game. I got stuck and have been too stubborn to look up hints. But based on what I've played so far, I highly recommend this game. It's fairly simple and hinges on rearranging words to literally change the rules and behavior of the game. \"Baba Is You\" means that you control the Baba character, but if you, say, change the words so that \"Flag Is You,\" you instead control the flag. You can also accidentally make yourself cease to exist as a player, thereby instantly losing, so word rearrangements have to be done carefully.I love it when I try and retry a level several times only for something to suddenly click in my brain - it's so much fun to discover the trick that will let you beat a particularly annoying level. You really have to think outside the box at times. This is different from a lot of the games I play, in that it has no real story to it, but the puzzles are so intriguing that I don't really care.","BABA is FUNhasMETA is FUNBRAIN is HURTisnotSMOOTH","i cant tell if im smart or dumb when playing this game. i jam to the music all day tho","It's difficult, but it's fun","Baba Is Mercenary","Very unique puzzle game, can be pretty difficult but that makes it even more satisfying to solve.

Difficult puzzles and a general lack of hand-holding are fine, but a puzzle game needs to ensure it gives the player a fighting chance to succeed. Its also guilty of blatantly refusing certain solutions, akin to invisible barriers in 3D worlds which limit the player to operating within the boundaries set by the developer. It feels a bit cheap at times.Still, theres no denying the immense satisfaction awaiting players who manage to complete the later puzzles. The sense of accomplishment is at times reminiscent of defeating a boss in Dark Souls, so for patient players who are willing to persevere, theres a lot to get out of this game. Highly recommended despite its minor flaws.","Rose Is RedViolet Is BlueThis Games Too ConfusingBaba Is You","Probably my favorite game I've ever played.","Incredibly simple concept that makes you think; this is a great game for all ages.","imaginative and pixely - everything you could ever want","This is a good puzzle game.

NO, this game doesn't f*ck around and it hasn't any bullsh*t, EVERYTHING is planned out so you can overcome every puzzle without breaking the core rules of it, AND LET ME TELL YOU, once I calmed down, thought outside the box and tried another approach, I solved THAT MOTHER F*CKING PUZZLE, the eureka moment hit me and it felt good, IT FELT GREAT, the dopamine of me solving that puzzle hit my brain faster  than diarrhea on a saturday.

A world will have new concept X in stage 1 (very easy), but then stage 2 is concept X + new hidden mechanic Y. Then you keep failing because you think you just don't fully grasp X, and get frustrated. Oh and then stage 3 is entirely an old mechanic to break the flow.In The Witness for example they make sure you understand a concept before moving on, so you're prepared when the complexity increases and mechanics are combined.

It means we play the game more like someone trying to hack the game by glitching it out rather than being a character in a world on a quest - maybe though that is deliberate? To make us feel like l33t speedrunners? The problem with this is that in an early level I had to look up how to solve it because I was playing 'in character'. I literally never would have solved the puzzle because I didn't expect it to rely on glitch behaviour. Now when I get stuck I'm always thinking 'is there a new glitch mechanic I don't know about?' and so I search for answers more readily. Already I've ruined a level because I searched for an answer too soon expecting a glitch and it was an 'in character' solution I just hadn't tried yet.The music gets a bit annoying and the visuals are pretty basic, especially on screens where puzzle is small but they get the job done.After all this I still would recommend because it is so awesomely interesting","game is good","Graphics are in a bare minimum style.

Bending the rules and moving the goalposts (literally) becomes your best friend when trying to solve each level in multiple unintuitive but creative ways.Editor's note: Sokoban is a classic box-pushing game originating from Japan which follows a strict set of pattern recognition to solve each puzzle in a specific way. Due to the high complexity of such games, this form of puzzle is considered difficult and time-consuming. Category Rating Detailed Breakdown Design & Graphics Average cute artstyle, lovingly simplistic graphic design, comparable to learning a programming language, difficulty ramps up way too fast, too time-consuming thanks to puzzle complexity and search depth Sound & Music Good unique soundtrack composed of low-filter synths and pads, remains mostly in the background, surprisingly not annoying after longer listening, sound design fitting but nothing special, overall well done Gameplay & Controls Good satisfying puzzle solving by thinking outside the box, game traps you into obvious incorrect solutions, reverse-engineering as best solving strategy, intuitive grid-based control scheme, certain crucial aspects of puzzle rules are NEVER explained Appeal & Innovation Superb singular combination of problem-solving aspects, makes you feel dumb and smart at the same time, easy-to-understand premise masterfully executed, appeals both to kids and adults, simply fun to get into Content & Value Good Up to 40 hours of puzzle solving (if you suck as much as me), level editor regularly updated by the developer, small but active user community, reasonable pricing, no actual replay valuePersonal Score:Good(Scoring range: Poor (worst) - Bad - Average - Good - Superb (best)Personal Thoughts:Baba Is You is absolutely unique in what it set out to achieve. A hybrid of Sokoban-like box pushing and adjusting active rules to solve puzzles is something I have never heard of before. The cutesy and very child-like drawings of Baba and its(?) friends make the game even more appealing. Baba Is You is what I would describe as an almost sophisticated puzzle game, where form and function are incredibly intertwined with each other to the point of flawless execution. On the outside, the game is kept incredibly simplistic to hide that V6 engine of own programming language. And boy, does that logic compute. Subverting expectations is the name of the game. Rules are meant to be broken and rearranged. Break the game to win it. Later on, you'll start breaking the level selection screens themselves in order to access new or hidden levels. If that doesn't scream \"meta\" I don't know what does.Unfortunately, there are some downsides you have to consider. Baba Is You is possibly one of the hardest puzzle games I ever played. This is mostly due to me and my stupid way of thinking but also minorly due to the game not explaining certain aspects of itself. Specific rules generate non-intuitive sub-rules which lead to hilarious but frustrating dead ends until you read online on how the operators actually work. You will rip your hairs out in certain levels because specific Sokoban-maneuvers will have to be used and as someone who didn't play these games, I didn't even know they existed until I looked them up. The game can be very frustrating in that regard but very rewarding when done right. Even if Baba Is You seems as hard as learning a new programming language and you cursing at your coding because it doesn't work the way you want it to, it is incredibly fun to play casually. Just don't go in with the expectation that you will just ace every level in less than 5 minutes.","The simple things in life are often the best.Trains your brain and sharpens your senses.The only way to win the game is to completely change your perspective on yourself, the world and all the objects inside by altering a few basic rules and pushing bricks.","Cute.","booba","A fun challenging logic puzzler!

Taking me a while.","i like the rabbit but i hate the puzzles","this game made me realize i'm really stupid (i knew i was stupid before but i now know i'm really stupid)","The game itself is incredibly unique and fun. Fun and unique does not mean easy. Some levels take a lot of time and thinking to solve. Don't go into this game expecting to effortlessly breeze through every level.","This game made me break out into manic giggling when I worked out a concept more times than I can count.","Innovative, cute, but bloody hard. I can't recommend it to anyone who doesn't like repeatedly spending hours banging their head on a single puzzle (or cheating). I'm going to be a combo breaker here and not give this a mindless, meme-laden positive review. Note that the majority of people lauding the game have single-digit playtimes. This game would require a bare minimum of thirty hours to 100% without walkthroughs.Baba is You is the Dark Souls of puzzle games. Victories are sweet, but the process of getting there is frustrating and time-consuming. In fact, like many Dark Souls bosses, the puzzles here seem impossible and often require taking a mental health break before another round of attempts.Each area starts out with 1-3 puzzles of easy to moderate difficulty that introduce a new and straightforward mechanic. However, the dozen or more puzzles after that spike in complexity, are rarely intuitive (even if you understand the goal and problem) and require that you find a single solution way to \"break\" mechanics to win.I'll summarize and close with a car metaphor:Assume you've never been in a car before.Puzzles 1-3 teach you how to use the gas pedal, brake pedal and windshield wipers on an automatic transmission car.Puzzle 4 asks you to drive a semi with manual transmission.Puzzle 5 asks you to perform a burnout on a FWD automatic transmission family sedan...in the snow.Puzzle 6 asks you to get a '76 Ford Mustang to run on propane fuel.Are all of those things possible? Yes, but they're going to require a hell of a lot of time and trial and error. If that sort of thing is your fetish, then dive right in.

It will trick you into buying it, have a promising start, then after you've played enough to be unable to refund, it will start drastically dropping in its fun factor.I know the game is supposed to be hard, and I knew that while buying the game, but I was hoping it'd have at least a logical difficulty curve. BOY WAS I WRONG. The first few worlds are cool and fine, but soon the game just starts throwing at you way too many mechanics at once. Thankfully, you can beat the game quickly right? That's a good thing, right?NO ITS  NOTYou can literally any% this game BLINDLY in TWO  HOURS. And when you do, it just doesn't feel satisfying. At all.This game clearly wasn't made for me. I like puzzle games because they're a relaxing genre that I can play whenever I feel stressed out or I'm just not in the mood for my typical chaotic explosion filled goodness. But this game won't relax you. It will  torture you and give you an existential crisis.This is the biggest joke of a purchase I made in my life, and it just shows that first impressions aren't everything.I'll give it at that, some of the puzzles ARE fun, and none of them are uncreative. But they become way too obnoxius eventually.Still, I will try to give this game another chance, but so far this has been the worst purchase I ever made.4\/10 I guess I don't know  this ","LEVEL IS HOTBRAIN IS MELT  I lost","baba is who???????","Game awesome.Head hurtz.Buy now.","Ive been contemplating whether this is my favourite puzzle game. Opus magnum, a game I adore since I enjoy programming, has been my favourite puzzle game for a long time and I have a hard time choosing anything over ituntil Baba Is You came along. While I was deciding, this game managed to blow my mind not once, nor twice, but at least five countable instances and I have very rarely had a game continually make my brain fall out of my ears. It is also probably the most brutally hard puzzle games, just shy of SpaceChem, but much, much superior as I will explain.Baba Is You is, in my opinion, the perfect puzzle game. It has an interesting core mechanic that never becomes stale and evolves as you play through it. It also avoids something which a vast amount of puzzle games do which is what I like to call giving you a puzzle and leaving a piece in the box. What I mean by this is puzzle games tend to deliberately try and trick you, introducing bizarre interactions between elements which could never have been predicted or simply giving you an insolvable problem that you are somehow supposed to realise is insolvable and then realise you dont have all the pieces. Baba Is You is the complete opposite; everything is visible and it is up to you to find a sequence of steps to complete the level. It also does not at any point give you red herrings. I hate puzzle games that give you sensory overload with hundreds of pieces and then the solution is to use two of them. In Baba Is You, if its there, there is a good reason, even if you dont know it!The core mechanic of Baba Is You is that all the rules of a level are displayed in text form in a Sokoban\/grid-like layout. You can interact with them and break, extend or even create new rules to change the goal of the level; is the flag stuck in an impenetrable wall?  make the wall no longer STOP and you can sail through; Stuck in a room with no way out?  leave your old being behind and become the wall. The possibilities of success are plentiful!I will try to avoid as many spoilers as possible as this game is at is peak when you dont know whats coming next, but if youre still on the fence, here is some more convincing. I want to firstly say that I did not do Baba Is You justice on my first partial playthrough; I gave in too quickly and looked up far too many solutions and I didnt give the game the benefit of the doubt. Upon playing the game again I realise that this game excels in experimentation; you are not going to be able to formulate all possible combinations in your head and arrive at the solution immediately. Instead, the game actively encourages you to ask questions like: what if I construct WALL IS OPEN AND SHUT?; what if WALL IS NOT WALL? Herein lies one of the biggest allies of the game, and here you may be surprised to learn that there are basically no tutorials in the game. Yes, for a game this difficult and complex, there is no hand holding. But that is not a disadvantage, in fact, the game is telling you early on to experiment, to learn what commands do, and if you want to even contemplate the hidden levels, you are going to need to know how commands interact with other commands. My one critical piece of advice is to make sure that, when introduced with a new command, to experiment fully with it; how does it interact with this command? Can I chain this with another to produce another mechanic? Is this sentence allowed? The later levels test your understanding of these rules and if you miss a core interaction, the solutions can become nearly unreachable. If you ever find yourself stuck for a long time in a level, return to some of the earlier levels and just go through them; you may find interactions with old commands that you just didnt find the first time!The soundtrack is also something I quite enjoy; Im not usually a fan of 8-bit-like music but I found myself quite enjoying myself when solving the harder levels where I spent a considerable amount of time on any one level. The developer also gives 10% of all game sales to charity, which is just the golden cherry on top of it all. The only way I can conclude this is to say: just buy the game, or in Baba Is You language: BABA ON STEAM IS BUY","Absolutely brilliant."],["Best game ever.","baba is fun","Good game","This is the best puzzle game I have ever played. There is so much content for the $15 I payed for this game that I never came to regret my purchase. whenever I showed this game to a couple of my friends one weekend we were just dying of laughter because of all the absurd interactions this game has to offer. I was also blown away whenever I discovered some of the secrets of this game.

It's definitely worth checking out if you enjoy puzzlers.","one of the best puzzle games i have ever played. with expertly crafted puzzles and a great soundtrack while you play through them.10\/10 game.","A must buy if you love puzzle games.","Total mind.","Awesome","2020 Speedy Review CleanupI'm very familiar with programming and yet Baba is You is very difficult to wrap your head around at times. Part of it is because the puzzles don't always have an intuition to them. When programming, you have set rules and commands, and you can use the commands to do what you want so long as you follow the rules.This game instead lets you program by restructuring the rules, but in a way it's \"random.\" Because the rules you start with aren't always the same, and you might have to jump through a bunch of hoops to get something just the right way.When programming, you generally have set ways to transform objects, and you're able to start things at a broader level and then optimize it later. This game, especially for tougher puzzles, requires you to figure out the optimized solution from the beginning - and the \"optimization\" of changing rules is very confusing.So in my opinion, much more difficult than programming! That said, it's a unique puzzle game and well worth a try.","fun","One of the best puzzle games. Very challenging, but it feels incredibly satisfying when you solve a level that's got you stumped. Many of the levels really made me admire the devs' creativity.","This game is crazy in the best possible way. The puzzles in here are the most brain breaking puzzles I have ever seen in a game, and the dev deserves massive credit for creating these levels that force you to think outside the box in ways I could have never dreamed. As I have heard from other reviewers, this game makes you think you've outsmarted it, only for you to realize that was what you were supposed to do all along and you actually just learned a new mechanic. It really is a masterful game that really can't be compared to anything else out there.","Baba Is You is a must buy for puzzle fans, its rules are very simple but are able to create engaging and difficult puzzles within the interactions of these rules.","Question: what's the difference between a puzzle game and leetcode?For some people, there probably isn't one. They're both structured problem solving activities with graded difficulty.For me, the difference is something like intuition. A puzzle game creates it's own vocabulary, shows you how its elements interact, and even if you'd have a hard time describing them precisely in words, you have a good sense of what they'll do at any given point.Coding is the opposite: you have an exact documentation of what each function or operator does, and if you develop some sort of intuition about them, you do so at your own risk. Baba is You is solidly on the code side of things. The names of properties are irrelevant at best; I found they made it harder to remember what they actually did. I intellectually understand what each of them does, but there's no intuition involved. There's some interesting manipulations you can do, but the game doesn't know how to show you any of them. It just puts the pieces there and hopes you figure it out.If this game scratched an itch for you, consider learning to code. It's just as much of a game and you can actually get paid to do it.","one of the cleverest mechanics in a puzzle game veru good","this game hurts my brain in a good way. 10\/10.","One of the best puzzle game that combines Sokoban (box-pushing) element and rule-writing together to create a very innovative gameplay. You will manipulate the rules of each level to change behaviors of things in it and come up with a solution to the presented puzzle. Starting off simple enough to act as some sort of tutorial levels, the difficulty will increase as you go into the later levels and you might feel a little bit stumped but you can solve the puzzles at your own pace and skip it and come back later once you have more understanding of the tricks needed to solve the problems. Because, the game will try to teach you tips and tricks progressively thru the puzzles as you go on, so some levels might be better saved for later. The puzzles are really clever and many of them are memorable as well. Some puzzles do really create a feeling of  programming quiz but they'll almost always come with the Sokoban aspects.Lastly, I can't forget to praise the fitting visual and music, all of which are done by the sole developer, Hempuli.PS. Fans of this might want to check out Environmental Station Alpha from the same developer as well.

This is one of those games that I just had to do everything. I took several (I believe three) hiatus periods of a month or more from this game, as it became increasingly frustrating (read: challenging), but I'm glad I always came back to it and I'm glad I finished it. I don't have many games at 100% steam achievement, but with this one I had to.Puzzle games are not my favorite genre, but I do play enough of them, and this is one of the best. The way the logic works in the game challenged me to no end and continually forced me to think outside the box. There were so many ah-HA! moments in this game. It reminded me of how I felt about The Talos Principle when I had certain revelations. After I had my very first major game-breaking ah-HA! moment, I was so very proud of myself, and thought that it would soon be over. Nope. The game just keeps going and going, continually increasing in complexity.At times, levels in this game are fairly simple, even later on, and there is no difficulty in solving them. However, spending two hours on a level was not a rare occurrence for me. Much later in the game, I decided I had to set a 30 minute time-limit for myself, to stop myself from going crazy. After that I would get a hint, and look up the solution if I was completely stuck. The solutions and out of the box thinking just get so crazy, that I don't think I would have ever completed this game if I didn't do this. I recommend a similar system to anyone who is finding themselves stuck in this game. If you 100% completed this game with no-assistance in under 100 hours, you are a genius, or I'm not very good at thinking outside the box.The visuals in this game are so simple, but I really appreciated them. The music is also great and quite simple, but is not repetitive in an annoying way.","Best \"think outside the box\" puzzle game I know. Instead of just giving you very complicated puzzles, each level usually consists of a small, managable amount of variables, but requires you to figure out a trick before being able to solve it. I spent may weeks attempting the same level again and again, being sure that it's literally unsolvable and then laughing at my stupidity for not figuring out the \"obvious\" solution in hind sight.If you decide to play this, I highly recommend sticking with it and not cheating. No other game delivers such a feeling of accomplishment after you finally figured out how to solve this one particular level after days or weeks of attempting it - just to be stuck again five minutes later at the next one.","Ich bin zu dumm fr dieses Spiel.10\/10 Wrde nochmal verzweifeln.","this game makes my brain expand in size","Probably best logic game I've played"],["If you think that problem solving and intelligence is a main component of the brain, then yes.

This game expertly manages progression, with each chapter you learn new rules (and ways of bending them!) while never feeling out of your depth or it being to easy. Another great thing about this game is that you can pick and choose which puzzles you play in order to make progress, so on the rare occasions that you cannot solve a puzzle no matter how hard you try, you can just try another one without any consequences. And even in those cases I have come back and been able to complete them with no  problem at all, because that is how well managed the learning curve is. The immense satisfaction of bending the rules of the game into completing puzzles, cannot be emphasised enough, and trust me sometimes you'll question whether you're meant to be doing what your doing, and then find out that was solution all along. I thoroughly implore you to try this game, the art style and music are all fitting as well, and I love how game progression is displayed as traversing an island! The only two pieces of advice are this:, Firstly, just experiment, you can always reset and undo actions, and you'd be surprised the amount of new things you can discover to help complete the puzzle by just messing around. Secondly, keep at the puzzles, they never ever seem obvious at first, but when you do keep at it and solve it you feel absolutely great about yourself, in hours of playing I have only ever had to skip 2 puzzles. Trust me the solutions are always attainable.

The game is challenging enough if you do the bare minimum, but if you want the true ending, you're in for quite the journey. Without spoiling too much - the game gets very, very meta with its puzzles and forces you to think beyond individual levels.Yet, it all springs from something incredibly simple: the mixing and matching of different game rules, which are made of 3 word sentences like, \"FLAG IS WIN\" or \"BABA IS YOU.\" You take those two, and switch them around, and suddenly you're playing as a flag that's trying to reach Baba in order to beat the level. Or maybe you make it into \"FLAG IS BABA\" and your flag turns INTO a Baba. And as more words are added with their own unique mechanics, and you begin having to mix and match more and more different things in different ways, you start to really get an appreciation for just how deep and complex this game really is despite the very simple premise.If you're into super tough puzzle games, you'll love Baba Is You. It's a masterpiece of a game, but with its level of difficulty, it's inevitably going to be difficult or impossible for some to get into."],["Baba is YouFlag is WinGame is Awesome!","So many  brain farts, I love it!","GAME is GOODBUY GAME is YOUCONCEPT is CLEVERGAME is PLAYBABA is YOU","It's a good game","I am going to need a 12-step program soon because this game is beyond addicting!  It reminds me of a simpler time when problems were solved with logic rather than semi-automatic weapons.  This game challenges your brain, not your trigger finger and, in this day and age, the brains of most people are atrophying due to lack of use.  The only problem with that I have with Baba is You is that it keeps track of the length of time you play and realizing that you have spent 5 hours playing instead of sleeping is kind of embarrassing.","If you like solving problems other than your own there is no better game.

Everything purely relies on your ability to solve logic puzzles and nothing else.Please play this game if you have ever enjoyed puzzle games in any form whatsoever.","Its a good game, but it gets way too hard way too soon. It doesn't just have a difficulty curve, it has an EXPONENTIAL difficulty curve. Do not buy unless you like a challenge! But other than that, I HIGHLY recommend.","Baba is happy","This is a very creative concept. Can't say I've ever seen something like it before. In this game, you can change the roles of objects in the room and turn objects into other objects by pushing the nouns and verbs in the level around - you can even make these text blocks themselves interact with other room objects, if the [Text] noun is available. Solving the puzzles requires some very unintuitive mode of thinking; you have to un-learn a lot of what video games have taught you over the years, and constantly remind yourself of the fact that you can change the rules at any time and that the point is figuring out a way to change the rules that gets you where you want to be. That might mean making walls pass-through, changing which object in the room you control, making a key open a solid wall instead of a door, or simply stating that the object you control wins the level if you touch it, thereby instantly doing so.And all of that stuff happens in just the first world.This is one of these puzzle games that tie knots into your brain in the best way possible. Absolutely worth your cash and time.","my 3 remaining braincells have to work very hard to solve some of the levels.very cool and definitely something for people who like solving puzzles","This is a really smart puzzler that has a deceptively simple rule set but requires some really lateral problem solving.

They really stretch the limits of the rules that the game sets to an impressive degree.I have to admit that I did go online for walkthroughs on a handful of occasions. Sometimes I really kicked myself for not seeing the clue to the problem, but other times the solutions were so left-field that I can honestly say I would never have figured them out myself. In fact, I ultimately didn't finish the game when I did a walkthrough and still couldn't figure out why a solution would apply.

Of course, like all other puzzle games, I eventually started to understand the mechanics of each level, which helped me push further into the game.  With more than 200 levels, it took me quite a while for me to fully comprehend the clever gimmicks within each stage.

My son and I played together and we each contributed ideas to get ourselves unstuck. \"Maybe we're looking at this backwards\" he said once, referring to our assumption that Baba and Keke needed to be placed in a certain order, and realizing that reversing their positions would give us what we needed - that sentiment captures the utter simplicity yet mind boggling difficulty of the game's puzzles.

This one is bugged. \" and then you find the solution and you either feel dumb or smart.When you feel dumb, the level was okay, when you feel smart, they were usually excellent.I vastly prefer the levels that are about interesting logic and attribute problems to the ones relying on the block moving itself, but there is more than enough variety either way.Great puzzle game."],["game is goodsoundtrack is better","A lot of self-described puzzle games boil themselves down into operation-based and others that border on being more mystery games than not.Baba is You uses a simple logic-based mechanism (through text) to create logic puzzles that don't entirely feel like logic-puzzles due to the adorably quirky presentation and incredibly intuitive mechanics of \"You make the rules through changing the text order!\"It's an amazing game, and incredibly cathartic when you solve something you've been staring at for hours.Definitely recommend, Player is Dumb.","Great game. VERY BEEEEEEEEEG BRAIN GAME","Really great puzzle game. You gotta think out of the box for this one.","Baba Is You is this devilish application of simple logic puzzle concepts in increasingly complex and sometimes ludicrous arrangements. How much simpler could you get than having all the game's rules spelled out for you via text blocks? In many ways, Baba is actually more of a programming puzzle game than a standard logic puzzler, with how you rewrite the rules on-the-fly to suit your needs. It's very simple. Baba Is You, unless you move one of the blocks, then nobody is you - you're dead. Other characters and inanimate objects alike can be used as the player character in this way, just substitute Baba for another object. Collision, pushability, meltiness, and even invisibility are all dictated by the rule blocks. and for a while, the game plays around with these ideas in a charming and approachable way. In fact, most of the main world's puzzles aren't extraordinarily difficult. Hard, sure, but not unreasonable to a layperson such as myself. Then you find your first alternate solution, and the game you thought you knew starts to fall apart at the seams. Increasingly mind-bending, devious puzzles present themselves as you descend into a recursive purgatory, where the only escape is to continue downward. Saying more than that would be a spoiler. But despite the skyrocketing difficulty that awaits completionists, the game is *never* unfair. Every rule you need to know is laid out for you, and there is no penalty for messing up or taking as long as you like to solve a level. Every level in itself is quite short once you know the solution, but remember, this isn't a race. Every solution awaits you if you apply some trial and error and some clever thinking. Baba Is You is the closest I've had a game feel to the lawlessness of real life.If you're a fan of thoughtfully made puzzle games, I simply cannot recommend this game enough. While it's more down the alley of SpaceChem rather than, say, Myst or Chip's Challenge, anyone who enjoys puzzle games on the whole will find Baba Is You a stimulating - and cute - experience. The soundtrack is lovely too.","A very enjoyable, if difficult, puzzle game.Every level has a set of rules defined by adjacent blocks of words.You can move some of these blocks to change the rules to your advantage and win.The game can be very difficult sometimes but always enjoyable.Recommended to all puzzle lovers.","Yoyoyo","I have never enjoyed destroying my brain more.","9\/10 interesting puzzles and brainy solutions.

This is a game, where you push boxes while thinking outside the box. It gets you 'thinking with portals' in its own way. You start as a complete virgin and overwhelmed, watch your brain melt away but at the end of the day you may have broadend your mind. Sometimes I wished you'd only have to figure out the logic component of the puzzles and not the execution part where you push stuff around, because I'm not particularily good at that. But more often than not are those axis intertwined. And multiple rooms have more than one solution. That leaves one question. What is more mind-bending: The puzzles or trying to imagine what it would take to design them?","you is youbuy and review is winreview is goodbuy is cheapnot buy is defeat","","This game is so incredibly fun. It is a must have if you like logic puzzles and charming sprites. The puzzles all make you think super far outside the box, and can get really hard. The high difficulty however, isnt annoying whatsoever! The rate at which it teaches you about the game is very well balanced with the difficulty curve, and each level teaches you a new way to manipulate the rules and make each puzzle your own, making for a consistently difficult but doable puzzle game, and that paired with the adorable and charming sprites and the absolutely hilarious ways that the game deals with certain scenarios makes this one of my favorite games of all time only ten hours in!","The Good:Very creative puzzle game.Tons of content.Actually really damn hard.The Bad:Does not introduce you to certain concepts very smoothly.","why does this game keep calling me baba my name is john","This minimalist, logic-based game requires players to change the rules in increasingly challenging puzzles laid out in an overworld map.

And make no mistake, this game gets HARD. You'll spend a lot of time feeling really stupid, and then a lot of time feeling really smart.I actually found this to be great \"couch co-op\", so to speak--having more than one brain looking at the same puzzle can sometimes get past the brick walls of not seeing the solution. It's at least knowing that if you find yourself thinking in circles, take a break and come back with fresh eyes. The great thing is that the non-linear level progression allows you to do this--you can hop from level to level, and even world to world, without having completed every single thing you have access to so far.","i  hate this gameevery level wants you to do something impossible but apparently there's a lot of impossible to go around","This game is good but it's too hard for me.","baba is confusing","excellent level design, fun challenge, highly rewarding and fun!","An obvious must have for anyone who enjoys puzzle games -- this long in, a year or two after buying it, there are still a dozen or so puzzles that I'm stuck on.

It has exposed many limitations of my monke brain. Generally I'd either find the solution to a level within 10 minutes, or it would take over 4 hours, or I never found it. At most one or two levels were somewhere in between, out of hundreds.Is BABA too difficult? I'd say a little bit. There's plenty of hints and guides online though, and honestly if it weren't as difficult as it is, I think that would only be because the developers underused the game's possibilities.BABA is definitely worth your money, go buy it.

Some of the puzzles can be quite tricky and take some time to figure out, so it also tests your patience and creativity.","Good puzzle game.","Baba is You is an extremely unique game. Its not an easy game, by any stretch of the imagination, but a very interesting one to play nonetheless. The simplest way to describe it to say that it's a Sokoban game where alongside the blocks themselves you can move around individual pieces of logic which define how a level is played in the first place. So, for instance, you can push a key into a door to open it. But, guess what, the logical statement that defines that the door blocks your way and that it can be opened with a key is right there in the level you are navigating and it is made of movable blocks. So, instead of dealing with a key you can move the logic blocks to form a different sentence, defining that the door is not locked. Or that instead of your character you are now controlling the door and so you can move it around to the target area to win. Or that the door *is* the target area, so you can just walk into it to win. Or that the door is both target area *and* you so you will win instantly. Etc etc etc, I think you got the idea.Often this all gives you a huge amount of creative freedom in solving each level. But it's not a goofy free for all, of course(though it can be, at times), and there are a lot of ways level design can limit all(or most of) the insta-win rule interactions to make you actually think hard to solve the puzzle. Unfortunately, this some times leads to a rather frustrating experience where only a very specific and highly unobvious solution will work but such is the way of things, I suppose, when it comes to such puzzle games.","Rose Is RedViolet Is BlueBaba Is YouBrain Is Pain","Fun puzzle game!","I love this game, don't you dare say I don't","The secret to beating this game is to not beat it and instead watch your math PHD friends play it and every once and a while you figure it out and they are so in the zone that they act like you just did some crazy smart sh*t and that's real nice","whenever you don't have anything to play you boot this, get a headache for trying to pass a level, jump to another one, intensify the headache, jump to another one and decide to just go to sleepbut it's goodit's really good","Puzzles made by geniuses.

The things this game does with its rules gets pretty darn crazy.Most of the rules are self-explanatory, but some are not obvious in how they interact with you and other objects, which can make some puzzles frustrating and lead to \"What! That's how that works?!\"In general though, they're all very enjoyable and some make good use of misdirection. Getting past that one puzzle you were stuck on for days and being able to say that you figured it all out on your own is something that makes you feel vry smrt.If you're prone to looking things up you might not get as much enjoyment out of this aspect of the game.... because it's a puzzle game.

Really love how ingenious the puzzles are.","It's really fun, and the main gimmick of the pushable words is really unique. Don't let the cute characters fool you, though, it is HARD. You will inevitably wind up looking up guides for a level at one point or another. The first few levels are easy, and introduce you to the mechanics of the game. From there, the first real world is quite hard -- but apparently not hard enough, as going forward, each world is harder and harder. Don't get me wrong, it's fun, but only if, after around two hours of trying to find the solution for that one level, you finally give up and look for a guide, or some hints at least.Oh yeah, and having a level editor (in beta at the time of this review) is just amazing.

A supremely elegant puzzle design where it seems no matter how many twists you discover in the mechanics there are always more.Some things I liked, a non-exhaustive list:1. A lot of \"endgame\" content. I don't want to spoil what I call the endgame at all, only to say that what you first think of the endgame is not the endgame. I guarantee you that you will have no idea what it is about to be if you haven't played before.2. Puzzles that strike a good balance between difficult and fun. Too many puzzlers can't seem to hit this fine line, and usually on the side of too difficult. These puzzles, however, are more about exploring interesting, surprising, or fun elements of the mechanics, rather than trying to impress the player with how smart the designer is. The \"aha\" moments come at the right time, so there's enough of a struggle to make the success feel special but not so much that you feel frustrated and stupid for not thinking of the solution earlier. That said there are some absolute brain melters in here but they are optional and you can get to every ending without solving those.3. Nothing was left on the table. I am not smart enough to know if there's a better word for this idea, but I mean by this that every mechanic and rule in the game was explored fully and and it didn't feel like any necessary mechanics or rules were left out. Yes, a level editor lets us all make our own puzzles but I don't think any of us are going to create something that was truly missing from this game. This reminds me of how Jonathan Blow's puzzle games leave no stone unturned, though Baba Is You doesn't have the same... well... pretentiousness. So if you're playing and you think \"a neat puzzle mechanic would be...\" then it's probably in the game.4. I mentioned the level editor. I like games with level editors (provided it makes sense for the game). Again, it's rare that user-generated content will ever be better than the game it comes from. But this game is inspiring and I want to be able to tinker with the mechanics myself, even if my puzzles are too easy or not all that interesting. Who knows, maybe you'll come up with your own idea for a game from messing with the editor.5. Many puzzles have multiple solutions. Not all, but many. And it never really feels like you're cheating by finding an alternate solution. Usually any unintended solution will be much, much more difficult than what I think is the intended one anyway. But it's nice that the developers let us do it.6. There's something haunting about the \"true ending.\" Don't want to spoil it. You're just going to have to find it.10\/10","If you're looking for an incredible puzzle game with genius puzzles that literally break the common rules of any puzzle game, then look no further than Baba is You. On the surface an extremely simple concept, but there are so many layers to the mechanics of this game.A simple sentence 'Baba is You' allows you to control the character Baba. But what if Baba is replaced with a rock, a bird, a skull, a tree or... nothing? Every single puzzle is unique and loads of them are extremely challenging and fun to figure out.Yes you'll get stumped... a lot.

When you clear an area, you can advance into ones you haven't been to before. Then, if you're the kind of person who likes discovering secrets, this game does amazingly well. This kind of classic video-game vibe was really refreshing to see meshed with the puzzle genre. Then, for the puzzles, the difficult tag is no joke. It's not painfully easy, but it's also not impossibly difficult. Imo., it's just the right difficulty for people that love critical thinking and want to relax with a puzzle game. What I love the most is the way the mechanics of the puzzles; it was really fun experimenting to find out what things do and how things work, then exploring the different possibilities. It's a really \"think-outside-the-box\" game where you can mess around and achieve outcomes that didn't seem that obvious face-value, and I think that's really cool.The cherry-on-top was the fact that I found this game actually quite fun to play \"with\" others; it's not a co-op game, but if you have a spouse\/gf\/bf\/friends that like puzzles, it can be fun getting carried by them when you're stuck figuring it out with them. (...thanks jacob) When I first saw this game, I thought maybe a game that exclusively focused on puzzles wouldn't be that fun to me because I usually like games with an over-arching goal\/end or adventure, but I thought I'd give it a shot because the \"Overwhelmingly Positive\" piqued my interest and I did like seeing puzzles in games. The fact that I actually felt that sense of overall goal and adventure was a pleasant surprise, and with the top-notch puzzles, I can see the ratings were clearly well earned \\\\o\/","Baba is You is a staggeringly simple in concept puzzle game. The game takes place on a grid, in which certain tiles logically determine the behavior of other objects in the level. While it all starts out simple enough, e.g. moving push from rock to door so you can push the door blocking your path out of the way, the complexity of puzzles quickly balloons, to the point of being mind bending and headache inducing. But of course, I wouldnt have the game any other way. I personally wasnt interested in dedicating a huge amount of time to Baba is You and used a guide for any puzzle that sufficiently stumped me, but Id wholly recommend doing so if you get stuck, at least if you reach the point of being ready to walk away from the game, as I think its worth it to experience everything Baba is You has to offer, even if you cant solve all the puzzles on your own.","Good game, but not for me.

It's a simple combination of spatial maneuvering with words and logic gates.  It's very simple to pick up and play and has tons of puzzle that will stretch your mind in different ways and have a wide variety despite all relying on a single puzzle mechanic. Despite being single player, it's also very fun to play with a group arguing and brainstorming over the harder puzzles.  The concept and screenshots may look simplistic, but the charming artstyle\/music and amount of content make it well worth the price.","challenging"],["You can think as hard as you want, but sometimes you just have to turn your brain off and back on again.","brain is dead","I got stumped in a few places, but it's very good and I really like baba","As many have said, it IS very difficult. Not only do you have to think outside the box, you've gotta come up with a new way to think outside the box on nearly every level. It's got very clever gameplay, and while the mechanics on their own would have made for an incredible game, the creator went the extra mile by creating a myriad of ways to use its mechanics in tons of puzzles with unique problems AND solutions. It has tons of content, it's well worth the price, and it will never stop surprising you from start to finish. Highly recommend. A joy(A word of advice, don't fall into the habit of looking up solutions, but definitely don't abstain from it either. Even though the completionist in me will always be unsatisfied that I looked up hints\/solutions to   two levels, there were a couple levels that I banged my head against the wall for literal months over, and by the time I solved them, it really was not worth it. Figure out what your cutoff point for satisfaction is fairly quickly.

The level design is awesome, and makes good use of said game mechanic.

I wandered through 'space' until quantum superposition allowed to be SMALL and BIG at the same time. Now I'm trapped between two worlds. And no, I cannot fix it, because I accidentally pushed the superposed quantum words into a corner.If you haven't understood a single word of what you've just read, then you should play this game to be able to.

Especially if you enjoy programming and problem solving!","Phenomenal game design!! I haven't used my brain as hard since high school mathematics competition... I can feel something is awakened inside me."],["i've always loved puzzle games. baba is you is probably the best puzzle game ive ever played, and therefore, my favourite game. i simply cant recommend it enough.now i'm definitely not the smartest when it comes to these types of games, so something i enjoy a lot about it is the open ended nature after the main mechanics are established. if you're stuck on a puzzle, just play a different one and come back to it later, because being able to leave and come back with a clear head is so important; something that a lot of puzzle games seem to not realise (in my own experience). and games that do this typically don't make it clear where else you can go, something baba does flawlessly with the seperate worlds and the chunks of levels within these worlds.the difficulty curve is really quite brutal though, i recommend taking a break when bouncing from level to level isn't helping, or playing with a friend who's played before. looking up hints is often frowned upon, but the point of a game is to have fun - if the puzzle becomes frustrating to the point it is no longer enjoyable then having a nudge in the right direction via a hint can really help. while it *can* be played both friend-less and hint-less, and a lot of people have found it rewarding to do so, personally i found it stressful.the presentation is incredibly effective too. it's simple, but charming, and both the pixel art and music being things that i myself look up to and find myself inspired by. i think even if you're not a fan of the presentation, it shouldn't get in the way as the whole point is that it is simplistic.i have so much more to say, but please, if you're still on the fence about it - i can promise you won't regret buying it. there is so much content to enjoy if you love it. you might find that it's not for you, and that's okay; the experience of the first 20 or so levels themselves alone is worth the price tag. you won't be disappointed either way. i love this game to bits, basically.","Honestly, one of the best puzzle games I've played in the past 10 years. Extremely intelligent and fun game, Highly recommend","I've always thought that there are 2 types of puzzles you'll get stuck on in puzzle games:1. The kind where when you realize what you're supposed to do (or if you look it up), you are kicking yourself thinking, \"how could I be so stupid!\"2. The kind where when you realize what you're supposed to do\/look it up, you think, \"yeah...ok...I see what you did there, but I don't feel so bad for missing that.\"This game introduces a 3rd and 4th type that honestly should NOT be in puzzle games:3. The kind where when you look up what you're supposed to do, you think, \"WHAT? I'm pretty sure the game WON'T let you do that?\"4. The kind where you accidentally do the right thing and then spend the next 10 minutes trying to figure out in what universe does this make any sense. (this is literally a first for me in any puzzle game I've played)I will say the first 2 \"areas\" (not including the \"tutorial\") are quite brilliant and have a lot more of #1 and possibly #2. But the 3rd area introduces the dreaded #3 above (if you've played the game you probably know  what I'm talking about). For the record I played this game a fair amount offline and played through all puzzles in the first 3 areas and about half the puzzles or more in areas 4-7.This game is listed under logic games and is confusing, convoluted, irrational, and utterly illogical at times. It will arbitrarily decide to \"change\" the rules when it decides to with no warning or explanation to the player. I would normally be fine with a game that has no explanations IF it made perfect sense. For instance, you learn very early on that you cannot line up \"BABA IS ROCK IS YOU\", but you can line up \"BABA AND ROCK IS YOU\". No explanation is given, but the most obvious logical explanation would be that bad grammar is not acceptable. Yes, this would make perfect sense...but no this is not the case. Later on bad grammar is perfectly acceptable (and necessary) to complete puzzles. Then there are the puzzles that even when looking up a video of how to do it, I still have to go through it a few seconds at a time because of how little sense some of the puzzles make. I'm not alone as apparently many people have commented in the videos how they only barely discovered how to do it after a long time and were looking up to see that \"surely there must be a better way,\" but no, not in this game.There really are a few brilliant moments early on and a little here and there, but there are much better games that are much more logical than this. This sums it up best:BABA IS NOT LOGIC  IS NOT FUN","puzzel","puzzle water","Simply one of the best puzzle games of all time. For fans of The Witness, Snakebird, Stephen's Sausage Roll, etc.","I got this game when it came out and quit because it was harder than expected, but I came back to it recently and am enjoying it a lot. There's a TON of levels and they all make you feel smart for solving them. I'm still less than halfway done with completing every level (spoiler free, except for 2 or 3 levels where I just had to look up a hint\/solution), but at this point I'd recommend Baba to anyone looking for a fun challenging puzzle game.","It's good but man it gets wayy too difficult way too fast.","God save my brain, it's melting...

I think it's a suitable game to play with kids too.","Great puzzles requiring lateral thinking.","i love this game so much but at the same time it melts my brain. so yes 10\/10","Baba Is Yes"],["U","I refuse to be beaten by this game but damn Baba's got hands","Baba Is Hard.

But wait, you were an idiot again and it was not simple.","Amazing Game","Baba is GodBrain is Hurt","BABA IS POG","The single greatest puzzle game I've ever played. And with a certain amount of replayability with how many levels there are it can be difficult to remember how to beat them.","Adorable art, great music, challenging puzzles that make you feel like a genius when they click. The one thing that holds this game back from being the literal perfect puzzle game for me is that a few of the solutions are really hard to intuit (particularly when new mechanics are introduced) and I think a hint system could've helped prevent the handful of times I had to pull up hints online (for those who are struggling but don't want to just look up the solutions, IGN has a walkthrough that trickles hints to you one at a time as you need them). That's a tiny criticism that only really applies to a couple of levels out of hundreds, overall one of if not the single best puzzle game I've ever played.","Good game","music           brainbaba on computer is smile         ear              pain          is        vibe","Great puzzle gameYour brain will meltand your brain will expand when you figure out the solution","Roses Are RedViolets Are BlueBaba Is BestGame Is BuyTLDR; literally the best game i every played and its definitely worth the price10\/10","Intellectually fun with blooming emotional backgrounds, this game simply presents itself as what it is.

This is always happens with good games, but I very much regret not playing this earlier haha. This is one of the best puzzle games ever made. Damn. This is like a programmers wet dream. All the logic gates in your head, twisted constantly until it hurts. But you keep coming back.","I uhhh, man what a good game.This game is tough AF, but never cave and search solutions.  Just come back to it.  This is'nt a binge game but a game to play with friends, family, and also by yourself.  I've had alot of memories playing this game with friends and getting stuck on a level.  We would text possible solutions to the level as we \"marinated\" on the puzzle.Highly recommended, this game has placed itself in my most memorable games. Its hella challenging but the amount of endorphins released when you finally solve that puzzle on your own is indescribable.","baba is me","review is youreview is win","baba is you willl challenge you, and in the best ways possible.

By the end of it all, you'll likely have a basic understanding of programming, assuming you haven't fried every brain cell you have.I'm still unsure which will end up happening to me.","An unsuspected new all time favorite game of mine. Very few games have brought me this level of joy in such quantity as this one has. Each level, especially the difficult ones, have a unique quirk or story to tell making them a joy to solve. My hope is that eventually I am able to forget some of the solutions I spent time figuring out and get to play this game all over again."],["Very fun and challenging","very cool very nice","Brain in Pain is You","I appreciate the ability to remove animation and sound, but also appreciate how cute it is when it's NOT removed.","Absolutely melted my brain. Highly recommend!","If you saw the game's trailer you know all you need to know about the game.Baba Is You... is a programming language... disguised as a Sokoban puzzle. As an aspiring computer\/software programmer, that's how I describe it. Sokoban but with the addition of text denoting objects (BABA, FLAG, ROCK, ...), attributes (YOU, STOP, PUSH, ...), and keywords (IS, AND, NOT, ...) designed to form \"rules\" for each level.This whole rule making-and-breaking concept truly makes this puzzle game unique and encourages a new puzzle-solving mindset, and I love it for that.At the time of writing I haven't finished the game - as you progress, the puzzles really require out-of-the-box thinking, so if you decide to get it, prepare to sit there for potentially hours. I do really want to 100% this game one day.","my brain is too small for this","Makes me feel like an idiot, then it makes me feel like a genius, but mostly it makes me feel like an idiot.","Good","It is such a smart puzzle game that is very fun!","cool puzzle game","Game Is Best","Hands down the best puzzle game out there and well underpriced.

I have played enough to know that this is a fantastic game about making and breaking the rules and the whole game is basically a tutorial. Baba Is You is designed in such a way that you'll start trying the first solution you can think of only to find out the dev also thought of that and blocked it to force your brain to expand. You will need some help to solve these puzzles but luckily there are some excellent guides out there that will give you a series of escalating hints until they reveal a solution that leaves you staring at the screen either saying \"How was I possibly supposed to figure that out?\" or \"I was so close!\"","One of the best puzzle games ive ever played. So simple and so brilliant!","This is a truly devilish puzzle game. At its simplest, it's a mashup of a logic puzzle and a block-pushing game, which would in itself be a wholly unique combination of ideas. Yet where this game truly shines is in its level and puzzle design. The game is almost relentless in simultaneously getting you to discover new ideas and mechanics while breaking your prior assumptions of old ones that you thought you already mastered. There's a constant feeling of floating in a mental void of mystery and potential, caught between a ceiling of possibility that is ever expanding above you and a floor of understanding that is ever receding beneath you.","brain pain.","Mind is MeltPuzzle is FunGame is GoodRecommendation is Multiply.","Dumb is me","Completed this game last night.

It encourages thinking out of the box, more than any other game I've played. You can't assume anything and it really feels like it teaches you a new way of thinking. However it is not at all a faint game, taking me 40 hours of gameplay to 100% the game; and yes 100%ing the game is definitely worth it.","rose is redviolet is bluegame is goodbaba is you","baba s me","This is a game where you move things, and those things are the rules of the game.
