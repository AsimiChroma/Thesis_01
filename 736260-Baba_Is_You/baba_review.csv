1,2704,baba is Good :)
2,2704,"this game is hard. it stresses me out and makes me frustrated. dont be fooled by its cute gamestyle, art and music. YES Baba is adorable and you wanna hold him in your pocket or kiss him on the head but sometimes it doesnt feel worth it. sometimes i get so mad trying to solve a level that i just want to smash Baba. then you FINALLY figure out the level and you see the solution was so easy and simple and in your face it feels like the game is laughing at you, looking down on you like it knows it bested you. im not even that far into the game, so i cant imagine how much worse it gets. puzzle games are addictive and this game is fun, and the adrenalin and euphoria rush you get from FINALLY completing a level youve been struggling on is addictive and is a feeling im chasing in my normal life. i cant find it anywhere than this game. i recommend it but if you are impatient or have anger issues id recommend having a guide pulled up just in case. :)"
3,2704,Fun challenging puzzle game. cute graphics and music.

9,2704,Big fan of this game. Super fun and challenging puzzles that doesn't force you to beat every one to move on to next section.
10,2704,"super clever puzzle game! talk about thinking outside the box, this game will push your limits of creativity"
11,2704,"good game, honestly its worth enough for the soundtrack alone"
12,2704,Amazing game. Great music!A shame it made me realize how much of a brainlet I am. 0/10 - Love it!
13,2704,Most innovative puzzle game in existence.  Makes it fun to have my brain collapse at the difficulty of the levels.

18,2703,"I would like to personally meet the author and shake his hand.Really well done, sir. NOW GIVE ME BACK MY BRAIN YOU DEVILISH BRAT !"
19,2703,Amazing
20,2703,This is one of the few video games I've played where I actually feel smart.
21,2703,One of the best puzzle games ever. So much outside-the-box thinking.
22,2703,Very unique puzzles! Good gameplay
23,2703,Impostor Syndrome SimulatorBABAYA IS WEEPBRAIN IS DEADMIND IS DEFEAT
24,2703,"Never have i felt so dumb and smart in my life, thank you Baba, very cool!"
25,2703,"Want to feel like an idiot yet a genius at the same time? Like being infuriated at the game, and then even more infuriated at yourself when you figured it out? Like trying to not tempt yourself into looking at the answer for a puzzle on YouTube? Then this is the best logic puzzle game for you."
26,2703,very challenging and fun
27,2703,"Great game, a little short for the price but I'm glad I bought"
28,2703,I only played this game a little bit. Baba is making me lose a lot of sleep.
29,2703,"Hello! i recently got Baba Is You and completed the first world 100% (depths) and im wondering where the level editor is! ive seen a few videos where people have made levels, but i cant find the editor myself. is it DLC? hope not lol."
30,2703,great game! on a 1 to 10 scale i would rate it as X = your IQ / 14
31,2703,good
32,2703, this game
33,2703,fun gaem
34,2703,Game gets progressively more challenging and uses previous mechanics you've learned to build onto the difficulty. Super satisfying when you finally figure out the solution!
35,2703,"Whatever you do, don't read spoilers. This is the best puzzle game you will ever play in your life."
36,2703,GAME IS WACK
37,2703,Baba is you. Brain is no. Brain is ow. Game is baba. Baba is good. Baba is cute.
38,2703,"The game is cutsy and defenitelly has a charm to it. However it makes me feel like an idiot >:( Also I cannot go like 1 level without looking up hints on how to solve it, especially in the later stages."
39,2703,Only 5Head allowed
40,2703,puzzles!
41,2703,"I'm not smart enough for this game, but I love the idea and concept. Maybe if I had a programmer's mind I'd do better, but yeah. It's a nice little puzzle game ^-^ One of the good ones, but challenging!"
42,2703,"Super game! Really hard to solve most puzzles later on, very interesting mechanics. Takes ages to solve, so keeps you interested!"
43,2703,One of those memorable puzzle games.
44,2703,"Possibly the best, richest puzzle game I've ever played, and high on the list of best games I've played PERIOD.  Read the reviews, watch the trailers, it's a few bucks well spent."
45,2703,The most clever implementation of a block-pushing puzzle game I've ever seen. I love the creativity of the concept of this game.
46,2703,"Excellent puzzle design, easily worth the money"
47,2702,baba is fun... and neat puzzle game that forces you to not use common sense
48,2702,this game makes me wanna become a game developer myself
49,2702,Great Game. Loved the puzzle design.
50,2702,i might actually be a moron. causes a headache after 90 minutes of play so i recommend taking a lot of breaks and doing anger management techniques
51,2702,
52,2702,"I have nothing to add, just simply creative challenging puzzle game."
53,2702,"Baba is you is an amazingly creative puzzle game. It encourages thinking out of the box, more than any other game I've played. You can't assume anything and it really feels like it teaches you a new way of thinking. However it is not at all a faint game, taking me 40 hours of gameplay to 100% the game; and yes 100%ing the game is definitely worth it."
54,2702,rose is redviolet is bluegame is goodbaba is you
55,2702,baba s me
56,2702,"This is a game where you move things, and those things are the rules of the game. It will make you feel stupid and smart at the same time.Get it, then push objects and rules around."
57,2702,"Truly phenomenal logic puzzle game. Some (read: many) of the levels make me want to tear my hair out, but when I finally do figure out a solution? Triumph bordering on euphoria! Feeling profoundly stupid has never been so fun."
58,2702,"Entertaining, definitely need to think outside of the box sometimes. Took a coding class after playing this game, and honestly it gave me a head start. Can be difficult, there aren't a lot of levels but it might take you a while XD."
59,2702,If you like this game then you are the poop man. Bad game.
60,2702,absolutely spectacular puzzlegame with a brilliant core mechanic and peerless execution
61,2702,"One of the most creative puzzle games I've ever played. So abstract yet when you figure out a solution yourself it feel amazing. I'm only halfway to the end, but some of the puzzles take me days to figure out. This can get frustrating, but it's all part of the charm"
62,2702,"brilliant, cute and mind-melting everything a game should aspire to be"
63,2702,"I just found the puzzles way too hard to solve. There is a website that has all of the solutions, so you can get through all the levels, but I had to look up the answer to almost every puzzle. If you are really good at solving complex logic puzzles this might be the game for you, but it is not for me."
64,2702,Superb. Totally orginal
65,2702,it is a not bad game :)

88,2701,"7 Hours at the time of writing this review, and although im not even anywhere near halfway through the gamei have realized that a LOT of thought and work went into designing this.If you buy this, you will be frustrated, you will be stuck at some point and think there is no waybut the moment you finally understand what to do is incredibly satisfying,This is a game that truly deserves the 98% positive reviews."

90,2700,"I have played this game for no less than an hour at a time. This game has made me question my existence and sense of self. Lovely music and excellent, adorable visuals. 100/10"
91,2700,Harder than any Souls game
92,2700,There are some really tough puzzles in this one - very enjoyable if you want to sit down with a drink and ponder over some noodle scratchers.  The music is funky too!

100,2700,baba is you? or...is baba me?
101,2700,amazing puzzle game
102,2700,BABA is YOU is a game that forces you to consider what your reality is.If you don't like it ... you can change it!
103,2700,this game broke my brain
104,2700,metasokoban
105,2700,Probably the best puzzle game ever made. Beneath the adorable animations and soothing soundtrack is a diabolical masterpiece that will push the limits of your ability to think outside the box.
106,2700,This game hurts my brain and makes me feel dumber than a kindergartener. 10/10
107,2700,"Since I do not have a galaxy brain, I cannot even get close to beating this game. I have played enough to know that this is a fantastic game about making and breaking the rules and the whole game is basically a tutorial. Baba Is You is designed in such a way that you'll start trying the first solution you can think of only to find out the dev also thought of that and blocked it to force your brain to expand. You will need some help to solve these puzzles but luckily there are some excellent guides out there that will give you a series of escalating hints until they reveal a solution that leaves you staring at the screen either saying ""How was I possibly supposed to figure that out?"" or ""I was so close!"""
108,2700,One of the best puzzle games ive ever played. So simple and so brilliant!
109,2700,"This is a truly devilish puzzle game. At its simplest, it's a mashup of a logic puzzle and a block-pushing game, which would in itself be a wholly unique combination of ideas. Yet where this game truly shines is in its level and puzzle design. The game is almost relentless in simultaneously getting you to discover new ideas and mechanics while breaking your prior assumptions of old ones that you thought you already mastered. There's a constant feeling of floating in a mental void of mystery and potential, caught between a ceiling of possibility that is ever expanding above you and a floor of understanding that is ever receding beneath you."

112,2700,Dumb is me
113,2700,Completed this game last night. My brain hurts still from all the puzzles. Highly recommend to play it but as a completionist please spare your mind.

119,2699,Brain in Pain is You
120,2699,"I appreciate the ability to remove animation and sound, but also appreciate how cute it is when it's NOT removed."
121,2699,Absolutely melted my brain. Highly recommend!
122,2699,"If you saw the game's trailer you know all you need to know about the game.Baba Is You... is a programming language... disguised as a Sokoban puzzle. As an aspiring computer/software programmer, that's how I describe it. Sokoban but with the addition of text denoting objects (BABA, FLAG, ROCK, ...), attributes (YOU, STOP, PUSH, ...), and keywords (IS, AND, NOT, ...) designed to form ""rules"" for each level.This whole rule making-and-breaking concept truly makes this puzzle game unique and encourages a new puzzle-solving mindset, and I love it for that.At the time of writing I haven't finished the game - as you progress, the puzzles really require out-of-the-box thinking, so if you decide to get it, prepare to sit there for potentially hours. I do really want to 100% this game one day."
123,2699,my brain is too small for this
124,2699,"Makes me feel like an idiot, then it makes me feel like a genius, but mostly it makes me feel like an idiot."
125,2699,Good
126,2699,It is such a smart puzzle game that is very fun!
127,2699,cool puzzle game
128,2699,Game Is Best
129,2699,"Hands down the best puzzle game out there and well underpriced. If you've enjoyed any other puzzle game, buy it."
130,2699,i enjoy repeatedly removing baba from existence
131,2699,Text is mind-bending.
132,2699,Not much to say that other people haven't said before and better. Probably the best puzzle game I've ever played.
133,2699,This game force me to be smarter against my will
134,2699,Its good
135,2698,U
136,2698,I refuse to be beaten by this game but damn Baba's got hands
137,2698,Baba Is Hard. Me Is Dumb. Game Is Fun.
138,2698,yea ok
139,2698,"This game is great! You spend a long time thinking about how to do it, fail many times only to realise that you are an idiot and the answer was simple. But wait, you were an idiot again and it was not simple."
140,2698,Amazing Game
141,2698,Baba is GodBrain is Hurt
142,2698,BABA IS POG
143,2698,The single greatest puzzle game I've ever played. And with a certain amount of replayability with how many levels there are it can be difficult to remember how to beat them.
144,2698,"Adorable art, great music, challenging puzzles that make you feel like a genius when they click. The one thing that holds this game back from being the literal perfect puzzle game for me is that a few of the solutions are really hard to intuit (particularly when new mechanics are introduced) and I think a hint system could've helped prevent the handful of times I had to pull up hints online (for those who are struggling but don't want to just look up the solutions, IGN has a walkthrough that trickles hints to you one at a time as you need them). That's a tiny criticism that only really applies to a couple of levels out of hundreds, overall one of if not the single best puzzle game I've ever played."
145,2698,Good game
146,2698,music           brainbaba on computer is smile         ear              pain          is        vibe

149,2698,"Intellectually fun with blooming emotional backgrounds, this game simply presents itself as what it is.  A personal favorite."
150,2698,big brain game
151,2698,love the art and music. i wish i wasnt stupid
152,2698,If you love puzzles this is a game for you
153,2698,"Wow, holy crap. This is always happens with good games, but I very much regret not playing this earlier haha. This is one of the best puzzle games ever made. Damn. This is like a programmers wet dream. All the logic gates in your head, twisted constantly until it hurts. But you keep coming back."
154,2698,"I uhhh, man what a good game.This game is tough AF, but never cave and search solutions.  Just come back to it.  This is'nt a binge game but a game to play with friends, family, and also by yourself.  I've had alot of memories playing this game with friends and getting stuck on a level.  We would text possible solutions to the level as we ""marinated"" on the puzzle.Highly recommended, this game has placed itself in my most memorable games. Its hella challenging but the amount of endorphins released when you finally solve that puzzle on your own is indescribable."
155,2698,baba is me
156,2698,review is youreview is win
157,2698,"baba is you willl challenge you, and in the best ways possible. Its confoundable but also highly rewarding. Would recommend if you enjoy puzzler games"
158,2698,cool game very good game
159,2698,words
160,2698,Insane game
161,2698,"Baba is YouBaba is ThinkBaba is TryBaba is DefeatBaba is ConfusedBaba is ThinkBaba is TryBaba is DefeatBaba is ConfuseBaba is Go CrazyOkay but seriously, this game is really fun, but also very, very, VERY difficult.  By the end of it all, you'll likely have a basic understanding of programming, assuming you haven't fried every brain cell you have.I'm still unsure which will end up happening to me."
162,2698,"An unsuspected new all time favorite game of mine. Very few games have brought me this level of joy in such quantity as this one has. Each level, especially the difficult ones, have a unique quirk or story to tell making them a joy to solve. My hope is that eventually I am able to forget some of the solutions I spent time figuring out and get to play this game all over again."
163,2697,Brain cells ran out but I'm lovin it.
164,2697,"This is a very hesitant thumbs up.Baba is You is an ingenious game - the core idea is really brilliant, as are some of the more advanced mechanics. I can't possibly give something like this a thumbs down.But while it was interesting at first (and each time you are introduced to a new mechanic), once the novelty wears off, many of the puzzles become really annoying due to being devised of too many elements, in a way that I feel doesn't work well (it becomes more of a hassle to solve it than actually fun).At the end of the day, I really don't want to ever play the game again (and I haven't finished it), which is not a good sign. Still, I think it was overall worth it."
165,2697,"My brain turned into mush after an hour, realizing my brain isn't lobed enough to play this hard asf game. Finding out solutions on my own was the biggest brain expansion feeling of my life.Rules:Baba is youMusic is niceBrain is mushArt is cuteKind wish there are clues added to the game, because it is kinda hard. Overall its a pretty good puzzle game to play on your own or with someone in the backseat. Solving some harder levels is as good as sex. 10/10 good concepts."
166,2697,"A fascinating new puzzle mechanic is a rare thing. Play this, and enjoy exploring all the intricate implications of the gameplay. It'll be a long time before you get another game like this one."
167,2697,yea its pretty good
168,2697,One of the best puzzle games you can find on Steam.
169,2697,This game makes me feel like an idiot.
170,2697,Quietly clever puzzle game that keeps challenging you. No graphics. Or ZX Spectrum graphics which is the same. But it doesn't need them.
171,2697,Yes
172,2697,Baba is good
173,2697,It's a fun puzzle game with unique mechanics. There are a lot of puzzles to solve.
174,2697,"Took me 40 hours to 100%, but I played occasionally for 2 years, I couldn't handle playing it for more than 30 minutes straight"
175,2697,ROSE IS REDVIOLET IS BLUEFLAG IS WINBABA IS YOU
176,2697,Baba is you.Puzzle is fun.Puzzle is hard.Me am feel stupid when play.Game is still fun.
177,2697,"cool game, fun to figure out with friends"
178,2697,"It's a very hard puzzle games that can get really creative. But it's not for everyone and you'll need quite a lot of breaks to play the whole thing since being stuck in this game is very common and very unrewarding. To be fair, it compensates that with the satisfaction it gives you when you beat a hard level you've been stuck on for half an hour. I doubt I ll ever fully finish it as it has way too many extra levels and frankly, after a point it gets too complicated after a hard way of school/work . So if you are thinking of buying this game to 100% it, then good luck."
179,2697,incredible puzzle game!
180,2697,Awesome please play this game you need the editor.
181,2697,"Baba is you is really easy to understand, but the puzzles are surprisingly difficult! My husband and I had a lot of fun solving the puzzle together, and we is confuse! I think it's a suitable game to play with kids too."
182,2697,Great puzzles requiring lateral thinking.
183,2697,i love this game so much but at the same time it melts my brain. so yes 10/10
184,2697,Baba Is Yes
185,2696,this game is so hard it can't possibly have been made by a human
186,2696,Very intriguing puzzles with a unique concept! Great game!!
187,2696,literally the puzzle game ever. so awesome. love the little baba
188,2696,very fun
189,2696,BABA IS DONE
190,2696,"baba is hot, brain is melt, game is win"
191,2696,"I think CallMeKevin said it best when he said: ""Each level feels like starting from zero.""The first world is really good at introducing the various mechanics of the game and using them in very creative ways, unique to the puzzle game genre. So the first world gets a 10/10 from me. The art style is also really simple but effective, which also explains the music. The problem is the rest of the game where most of the novelty has worn out and each level feels less like figuring out the unique solution but finding their one specific solution they've made. Top that off with each level feeling like its own puzzle and less like each level feeds into the next giving you a sense of progression and that you're becoming more and more familiar with the game."
192,2696,makes me feel like in kindergartenand i love and hate it
193,2696,"Very hard, but very fun"
194,2696,game hard
195,2696,"Simply one of the best puzzle games out there. Sometimes I feel like a puzzle game can leave concepts unexplored, making the experience feel incomplete. Not Baba is You, every concept is stretched and warped in every conceivable direction that you can think of and then some. The game respects your intelligence, building up concepts from small simple solutions up to complicated 30-minute, brain-melting levels. As a result, this game is HARD, but the most rewarding and satisfying puzzle game that I've played yet."
196,2696,GAME IS GOODBABA IS YOUBABA IS BUY GAMEBRAIN IS DEFEAT
197,2696,"Baba is You is an amazing game for anyone who loves puzzles, its original gameplay and challenging puzzles are definitely going to give you lots of playtime, it has lots of interactions that  the game will keep introducing you to.This game will surely give you a lot of fun if you love original and challenging puzzles!"
198,2696,i like baba is you. it gives you the chance to become a game designer. also check out what the golf.
199,2696,"Great little game in the tradition of Sokoban and Chips Challenge. The only real cricique i have is that some of the game elements aren't explained well by only tutorial-levels. For example the ""float"" block totally threw me off, i had no idea what works and what doesn't. The reduced coder art style, while quite endearing, doesn't really help a lot with clearing up some of the confusion. If there was some visual cue on what the float-block does, it would have been much easier, but as it stands, i had to check a wiki for that.As such, i can recommend. But expect quite some frustration come your way trying to figure out what is even possible."
200,2696,this is insanely cool
201,2696,Brilliant puzzle game.A cool game jam idea that become a real game.Puzzles are challenging and fun. Mechanics are unique.A must buy.
202,2696,"As someone whose played tons of puzzle games of all shapes and sizes, Baba is You might be the hardest one of all time.  You have to completely throw out any preconceived ideas of how this game works in order to solve its puzzles.  Made my head hurt so much."
203,2696,baba is you will make you rethink your life. or maybe not. but it's a whole lot of fun and its full of challenges
204,2696,"Baba is HardBrain is brokenNo, seriously, call an ambulance, I'm having a stroke on this one."
205,2696,One of the most clever and brain boggling puzzle games I've ever played.
206,2695,"fantastic game. gives my the same level of puzzle satisfaction as talos principle.The music is nice, and the art style is cute."
207,2695,"Possibly the greatest puzzle game of all time. I was hooked from level 2, and thoroughly enjoyed solving puzzles all the way to the end."
208,2695,One of the best games I've ever played

222,2695,brain is melt
223,2695,One of the best games ever made period
224,2695,"The best puzzle game i have ever played, I underestimated it's difficulty but I am also a smooth brain, dont look up the solutioni, It ruins teh game entirely and the wiki does have hints,Highly reccommend"
225,2695,only puzzle game i can tolerate
226,2695,Excellent logic puzzles to distract from the burning world
227,2695,Fun to play with a friend especially if they aren't as clever as you so you get to feel even better when you complete a level as they sit there in awe of your godlike abilities
228,2695,"Highly recommended for all puzzle game fans, the game is pretty reasonable to complete, but there's lots and lots of content on top of that which takes it to pretty extreme levels of difficulty. Puzzle fans of most skill levels should have a great time with this game."
229,2695,"If you think you're smart, you won't after playing this. Fantastically designed game and although it was very frustrating at times, it was never the game's fault."
230,2694,its good
231,2694,Best puzzle game I've ever played. I even replayed it a couple of months after the first time I finished it.
232,2694,i thought i was getting the hang of it
233,2694,fantastic puzzle game; There might have been 2 levels in the entire game that I didn't like.
234,2694,"Seriously blown away by this game. It's a fantastic series of logic puzzles that will have you scratching your head to solve. Some seem impossible to complete and then all of a sudden you'll wonder why you were ever struggling.That said, I'm on a puzzle now that I simply cannot fathom.Anyway, graphics are retro-cool, as is the sound design - it's low on resources, so you could run it on a potato.Top marks."
235,2694,Infuriating puzzles that require lateral thinking and some ingenuity. Good game.
236,2694,the best game I've ever played
237,2694,good
238,2694,"I have lost count of how many times i shouted ""THIS MAKES NO SENSE"" and ""ohhh i feel stupid"""

243,2694,Breaks your mind.  In a good way
244,2694,"So  hard, but so  fun"
245,2694,"Very good and challenging puzzles that subvert your expectations and require some lateral thinking to solve, recommended for people that like puzzle games and don't mind being stuck on a level for a while. The game has a lot more content than it seems, finding  level (and consequently world) ""?""  is the most satisfying thing ever, don't spoil yourself the fun."
246,2694,"Truly a masterpiece with an innovative approach that will challenge and entertain. The concept is really simple, yet the puzzles can be very hard! It will not stop surprising you until the end.This game has really managed to find a sweet spot in the balance of everything. Take it slow. It is not a game meant to be rushed in any way.One of the best points is that the solution is almost always thinking outside the box. Each level has a unique challenge that you haven't seen before, so you need to learn and keep some sort of memory of mechanics and interactions between objects (which is the hard and fun part. Rewarding even). Try things you don't expect. Experiment.I've played along with a friend and, safe to say, it doesn't get much easier. So, a nice plan to spend some hours with a friend (or friends).Probably the best puzzle I've ever played - 10/10"
247,2694,This is a great puzzle game with many meta puzzles.
248,2694,run run huff huff baba is gud >:3
249,2694,ma head hurt
250,2694,i didnt know that i was baba
251,2694,"This game makes me actually think hard, and I like it. Feeling stupid and then making the genius solution that you never knew you had in you is probably the best feeling I've ever experienced in life. Also the concept in general is just cool."
252,2694,This is one of the greatest games to ever exist and EVERYONE should experience this game!
253,2694,Great puzzle game
254,2694,Very difficult yet fun game. I've played it for a bit now and my brain hurts.It's not made for small brained people like myself.Even though I had to look up some of the solutions to proceed I still had a blast and will be playing it again very soon! maybe even today.I do think there could be a system in the game where you can get or gather hints or something like that to help people like me through the harder levels but besides that I absolutely love it!
255,2694,I is John
256,2694,plz play this its so good
257,2694,"Baba Is You's a good game. Truly. But man, without any sort of intrinsic motivator, the puzzles are such a slog. The idea itself is so unique and interesting, manipulating sentences and statements through a map, but the execution was just not too fun to play through. If you're a savant at puzzle games, highly recommended. If you're somewhat mediocre at them, be careful with your 15$ This may be the game for you, but man, it just feels unintuitive and slow. There's so many puzzle games on steam, so I highly recommend making sure you understand the gameplay you're getting into. It's a good game, but I personally don't know if I recommend it to most people. Air safe on this one."
258,2694,"however, you must be very very very very very very smart"
259,2694,I wish I weren't so bad at puzzle games so I could play this brilliant game to it's end
260,2693,"i've always loved puzzle games. baba is you is probably the best puzzle game ive ever played, and therefore, my favourite game. i simply cant recommend it enough.now i'm definitely not the smartest when it comes to these types of games, so something i enjoy a lot about it is the open ended nature after the main mechanics are established. if you're stuck on a puzzle, just play a different one and come back to it later, because being able to leave and come back with a clear head is so important; something that a lot of puzzle games seem to not realise (in my own experience). and games that do this typically don't make it clear where else you can go, something baba does flawlessly with the seperate worlds and the chunks of levels within these worlds.the difficulty curve is really quite brutal though, i recommend taking a break when bouncing from level to level isn't helping, or playing with a friend who's played before. looking up hints is often frowned upon, but the point of a game is to have fun - if the puzzle becomes frustrating to the point it is no longer enjoyable then having a nudge in the right direction via a hint can really help. while it *can* be played both friend-less and hint-less, and a lot of people have found it rewarding to do so, personally i found it stressful.the presentation is incredibly effective too. it's simple, but charming, and both the pixel art and music being things that i myself look up to and find myself inspired by. i think even if you're not a fan of the presentation, it shouldn't get in the way as the whole point is that it is simplistic.i have so much more to say, but please, if you're still on the fence about it - i can promise you won't regret buying it. there is so much content to enjoy if you love it. you might find that it's not for you, and that's okay; the experience of the first 20 or so levels themselves alone is worth the price tag. you won't be disappointed either way. i love this game to bits, basically."
261,2693,"Honestly, one of the best puzzle games I've played in the past 10 years. Extremely intelligent and fun game, Highly recommend"
262,2693,"I've always thought that there are 2 types of puzzles you'll get stuck on in puzzle games:1. The kind where when you realize what you're supposed to do (or if you look it up), you are kicking yourself thinking, ""how could I be so stupid!""2. The kind where when you realize what you're supposed to do/look it up, you think, ""yeah...ok...I see what you did there, but I don't feel so bad for missing that.""This game introduces a 3rd and 4th type that honestly should NOT be in puzzle games:3. The kind where when you look up what you're supposed to do, you think, ""WHAT? I'm pretty sure the game WON'T let you do that?""4. The kind where you accidentally do the right thing and then spend the next 10 minutes trying to figure out in what universe does this make any sense. (this is literally a first for me in any puzzle game I've played)I will say the first 2 ""areas"" (not including the ""tutorial"") are quite brilliant and have a lot more of #1 and possibly #2. But the 3rd area introduces the dreaded #3 above (if you've played the game you probably know  what I'm talking about). For the record I played this game a fair amount offline and played through all puzzles in the first 3 areas and about half the puzzles or more in areas 4-7.This game is listed under logic games and is confusing, convoluted, irrational, and utterly illogical at times. It will arbitrarily decide to ""change"" the rules when it decides to with no warning or explanation to the player. I would normally be fine with a game that has no explanations IF it made perfect sense. For instance, you learn very early on that you cannot line up ""BABA IS ROCK IS YOU"", but you can line up ""BABA AND ROCK IS YOU"". No explanation is given, but the most obvious logical explanation would be that bad grammar is not acceptable. Yes, this would make perfect sense...but no this is not the case. Later on bad grammar is perfectly acceptable (and necessary) to complete puzzles. Then there are the puzzles that even when looking up a video of how to do it, I still have to go through it a few seconds at a time because of how little sense some of the puzzles make. I'm not alone as apparently many people have commented in the videos how they only barely discovered how to do it after a long time and were looking up to see that ""surely there must be a better way,"" but no, not in this game.There really are a few brilliant moments early on and a little here and there, but there are much better games that are much more logical than this. This sums it up best:BABA IS NOT LOGIC  IS NOT FUN"

265,2693,"Simply one of the best puzzle games of all time. For fans of The Witness, Snakebird, Stephen's Sausage Roll, etc."
266,2693,"I got this game when it came out and quit because it was harder than expected, but I came back to it recently and am enjoying it a lot. There's a TON of levels and they all make you feel smart for solving them. I'm still less than halfway done with completing every level (spoiler free, except for 2 or 3 levels where I just had to look up a hint/solution), but at this point I'd recommend Baba to anyone looking for a fun challenging puzzle game."
267,2693,It's good but man it gets wayy too difficult way too fast.
268,2693,"God save my brain, it's melting... Really creative and perfectly crafted game"
269,2693,"Still playing, but booooooy this is GOLD!The perfect game for thinking outside of the box and feeling like you've hacked the game designer by doing something unexpected."

278,2693,"A wonderfully pieced strategic puzzle solving game that I have grown very fond of. Are you someone who absolutely cannot stand leaving things unfinished, and has the urge of need to complete them? If so, we are like-minded and you will be playing this game for a good amount of time.Creative gaming strategy, Following simple game coding mechanics, with great challengesInterestingly simplistic and cutely quirky music that creates intensity to the puzzle solvingDiverse, well balanced progressively easy to respectfully difficult levels, including bonus levels to each sector, and having to be rather logically creative with some of the levels Enjoyable for everyone, especially those who love puzzle solving"

288,2693,Cute puzzle game
289,2693,"This game sometimes makes me wonder how my brain works. I can get stumped by one of the levels for AGES, then go do something else, then return to it to find the answer so startlingly, immediately apparent that I wonder what in the world happened the first time around.It's a really fun ""think outside the box"" puzzler, but man does it have a unique ability to make me feel dumb."
290,2693,is amaze BUT does get challanging
291,2693,"One of the best puzzle games out there.I'd say a particularly good aspect of it is how relaxing it is for a puzzle game. This is not a game about complicated permutations or optimizations. Solutions are simple and elegant. You won't be frying your brain thinking 36 steps ahead to check if your solution makes sense.It strikes a nice balance: It is genuinely difficult, but answers are never complex. It's always more about thinking outside the box, and yet it's also not unfair, as would often be the case with this kind of puzzle games."
292,2693,Great concept and well executed but also insanely difficult.
293,2693,Fantastic and difficult puzzle game that forces you to think outside the box.
294,2693,Baba is hard.Brain is small.
295,2693,"Playing this game reminds me of my childhood, a lot of screaming, cursing and items being thrown."
296,2693,baba is funishard
297,2693,"This is a really well crafted game - just turns out it wasn't for me. A friend made the key observation that without a plot, the only motivator becomes the puzzles themselves, and they just became too time consuming and frustrating for me to keep engaging. Hoping to come back to this one day and have more fun with it when I have more time, patience, and probably knowledge. Linux port worked perfectly with no issues, thank you!"
298,2693,"Don't let the cutesy graphics deceive you. This game gets REALLY hard. Even after playing it once by myself and once with friends, I still haven't beaten the game.Nevertheless, I think this game is one of the most innovative puzzle games and deserves all the attention it can get. The game keeps throwing new ideas at you, with each one more interesting than the last. The game explores every implication of its logic in mind-bogglingly impressive ways. In my opinion, it sits alongside Portal 2 in the ""All-Time Greatest Puzzle Games"" category.Did I mention that Baba Is You is Turing-Complete?BRAIN is MELTBABA is BESTGAME is WINEDIT: I have now 100% completed Baba Is You and never before have I felt so satisfied."
299,2693,Baba is you. Game is win.
300,2693,"A completely unique puzzle game that has you writing the rules of each level.Baba is You was GOTY 2019 in my books. A 10/10 game without a doubtI don't have a tonne to say about this game, you have to really experience it yourself. I've never played a puzzle game like it.In the early game, you start off each level as Baba - A white, hamster-like creature. There are *rules* around each level that you can push around and manipulate to change the fundamentals of the game. You want to be a rock? ""Rock Is You""You want to instantly win? Link ""Win"" and ""You"" to the same objectWant to clone yourself endlessly? That's entirely possible with the right combination of words.This game will make you feel utterly stupid at some points, and later an absolute genius. The simplistic style is perfect for a game *this* complicated. Everything is laid out clearly, you just have to pay attention.The OST is great, it's very pleasant to listen to. Even on repeat for hours while you struggle to find the solution to a level.I have nothing negative to say about Baba Is You, it is a perfect game."
301,2693,Yes I like puzzle games.Yes I looked up a few solutions to the puzzles in this game.Yes I spent a few hours trying before looking those solutions up.Yes I still have not completed this game fully.But why does that matter?The most important thing is...Baba is YouBaba is Win
302,2692,"I am an idiot, I don't look at guides or anything for this game and still somehow  my way out of some rooms, if you have spent more than 10 minutes looking at crossword and jigsaw puzzles without going crazy you'll like this"
303,2692,Baba is you.Level is hard.Time is passed.Level is unsolved.Head is explode.
304,2692,"Mark Brown (GMTK) chose this game for 2019, i cant say anything but yes"
305,2692,"probably the best puzzle game i've played for some time. very simple concept, but nowhere near easy"
306,2692,This game is very fun and cute! It's also incredibly challenging. If you want to use the level editor you'll need to opt into the beta.

312,2692,this is a really good puzzler and i have enjoyed every second of it. its just the right amount of hard so that its challenging but still not frustrating. and the art is really cute.
313,2692,IS BABA YOU?
314,2692,"This game made me question the moral and ethical consequences of investing time in a fun video game.Baba is You is a masterpiece that is so much more than what meets the eye, granted you invest enough time in learning and improving your technique. That is all I have to say."
315,2692,"An absolutely brain-bending puzzle game.  Strong play, good learning curve, utterly mind-melting."
316,2692,good game
317,2692,"man puzzle games aren't for me. this one in particular felt like a math problem. i like the concept and all, but it didn't give me time to feel confident with it that it was already a rubik's cube"
318,2692,I bought this game to feel smart but instead I feel like an idiot
319,2692, this game
320,2692,yeah
321,2692,"great idea for a puzzle game, the puzzles are fun and creative"
322,2692,If you enjoy puzzle games and to think about the solution of a level till steam rises up from your ears then Baba Is You is the perfect game for you. The way it plays is absolutely unique in the genre and makes you constantly think outside the box.  I never felt so stupid while playing a level only to feel like the cleverest person alive once I found the solution.  MissLuny is Baba is Recommended and Buy.
323,2692,
324,2692,Great game! Especially if you enjoy programming and problem solving!
325,2692,Phenomenal game design!! I haven't used my brain as hard since high school mathematics competition... I can feel something is awakened inside me.
326,2691,I M M E R S I V E - P U Z Z L E
327,2691,This is the best puzzle game I have played in my 30 years.
328,2691,
329,2691,"Great puzzle game, I really enjoy what I have played so far. The graphics are cute and well made, the puzzles start off easy but get very complex as the game goes on. Overall its a great game with many well designed logic puzzles that will make you feel like a genius once you actually solve them(or an idiot since the solution might be easier than it seemed)."
330,2691,Incredibly difficult game
331,2691,AWESOME!
332,2691,"A great puzzle game with a greatly unique game mechanic - there's nothing else quite like Baba is You. The level design is awesome, and makes good use of said game mechanic. Levels are at a perfect difficulty - they're not insanely difficult, but still challenging enough that you can't speed through them, making a great pacing for the game. It feels rewarding to solve a puzzle you've been doing for a bit. The game is also surprisingly funny. The art style, while simple, suits the game well and feels consistent across levels."
333,2691,"More A-HA! moments than any other game I've played, packed inside an adorable box filled with absurdist humor and a great soundtrack. S+"
334,2691,"After completing all the levels, I can confirm the legends. You can become Baba irl. The process is hard to explain and you wouldn't understand it unless you already knew how to do it yourself.I've been testing Baba's limits on our world over the past few weeks. This has led me to release a couple of academic papers on quantum physics after I found a trick to accumulate SMALLs on a single cell with seemingly no limit. I wandered through 'space' until quantum superposition allowed to be SMALL and BIG at the same time. Now I'm trapped between two worlds. And no, I cannot fix it, because I accidentally pushed the superposed quantum words into a corner.If you haven't understood a single word of what you've just read, then you should play this game to be able to. I'm leaving now."
335,2691,Baba is youisgoodandfun
336,2691,a decent puzzle game

340,2691,Probably the smartest game that I've ever played. My brain hurts 10/10.
341,2691,"I'm probably going to update this review when I've 100%'d the game, but with the 35 minutes I've played, I give it a solid 10/10. Especially fun to play with people who've already played it and are tempted to throw hints at me after 5 seconds."
342,2691,"This is a charming, yet relentless, yet rewarding puzzle game that deserves the praise it receives. The game pretty quickly asks for a good amount of time, thought and trial-and-error to find solutions to well-designed logic puzzles, and I admit to being stuck on several puzzles, though my inability to solve so far doesn't feel unfair  I just haven't earned them yet. I wholly recommend the game, just with the warning that it won't be a breeze."
343,2691,"My youtube suggestion is full of ""baba is you"" tutorials thanks to this. 100% i would do it again"
344,2691,Baba Is You And You Buy Baba

352,2691,It's an absolutely fantastic and brilliant game! There is really no other game like it.
353,2691,"When I bought this game 2 years ago, I found it really hard and frustrating. Some of the puzzles seemed very illogical, so I stopped playing it. Then the lockdown came and I started learning programming. Now I'm coming back again, and I can assure you - the logic behind the puzzles is SUPER solid. Very addictive game, but it's meant for people with strong logical problem solving skills. It's almost like an IQ test."
354,2691,You are not Baba for a majority of this game.
355,2691,Best puzzle game in years!

358,2690,"I got stumped in a few places, but it's very good and I really like baba"
359,2690,"As many have said, it IS very difficult. Not only do you have to think outside the box, you've gotta come up with a new way to think outside the box on nearly every level. It's got very clever gameplay, and while the mechanics on their own would have made for an incredible game, the creator went the extra mile by creating a myriad of ways to use its mechanics in tons of puzzles with unique problems AND solutions. It has tons of content, it's well worth the price, and it will never stop surprising you from start to finish. Highly recommend. A joy(A word of advice, don't fall into the habit of looking up solutions, but definitely don't abstain from it either. Even though the completionist in me will always be unsatisfied that I looked up hints/solutions to   two levels, there were a couple levels that I banged my head against the wall for literal months over, and by the time I solved them, it really was not worth it. Figure out what your cutoff point for satisfaction is fairly quickly. Also, start with the ""spoiler-free"" guide on the internet, when you have to.)"

365,2690,yeees
366,2690,No other puzzle game has made me think this hard. I'm not even sure how to convince my brain how to think in the correct way.
367,2690,"This game truly grabbed me, at many points I found myself toying around in a single level for hours, or simply staring at the screen, stubbornly refusing to look up the answer. It's stunning how much depth its mechanics have, and almost every solution is an enormous rush. It also has plenty of content (And hopefully more one day), so it's quite a hefty game for its price. I enthusiastically recommend it as long as you're willing to push your brain to its limits."

381,2689,"Harder than Snakebird or Room To Grow, but it doesn't feel as hard. Those games are tough because there are only a few simple rules, but every move you make has crazy knock-on effects; you'll run your head into a wall and find yourself restarting with little more information than ""so that doesn't work."" Baba Is You is tough because there are so many possibilities; you'll try something weird to see how it works, hit a dead end and restart because now you understand what you can do a little better."
382,2689,"fun, puzzles can be mind boggling."
383,2689,"I never thought I'd have that much fun playing a game that was purely puzzles, but here we areThe game is set up similar to Super Mario World (sorry if there's an actual proper name for this kind of genre/game); you have like a world map divided into different areas, and those areas have different levels you progressively unlock. When you clear an area, you can advance into ones you haven't been to before. Then, if you're the kind of person who likes discovering secrets, this game does amazingly well. This kind of classic video-game vibe was really refreshing to see meshed with the puzzle genre. Then, for the puzzles, the difficult tag is no joke. It's not painfully easy, but it's also not impossibly difficult. Imo., it's just the right difficulty for people that love critical thinking and want to relax with a puzzle game. What I love the most is the way the mechanics of the puzzles; it was really fun experimenting to find out what things do and how things work, then exploring the different possibilities. It's a really ""think-outside-the-box"" game where you can mess around and achieve outcomes that didn't seem that obvious face-value, and I think that's really cool.The cherry-on-top was the fact that I found this game actually quite fun to play ""with"" others; it's not a co-op game, but if you have a spouse/gf/bf/friends that like puzzles, it can be fun getting carried by them when you're stuck figuring it out with them. (...thanks jacob) When I first saw this game, I thought maybe a game that exclusively focused on puzzles wouldn't be that fun to me because I usually like games with an over-arching goal/end or adventure, but I thought I'd give it a shot because the ""Overwhelmingly Positive"" piqued my interest and I did like seeing puzzles in games. The fact that I actually felt that sense of overall goal and adventure was a pleasant surprise, and with the top-notch puzzles, I can see the ratings were clearly well earned \\o/"
384,2689,"Baba is You is a staggeringly simple in concept puzzle game. The game takes place on a grid, in which certain tiles logically determine the behavior of other objects in the level. While it all starts out simple enough, e.g. moving push from rock to door so you can push the door blocking your path out of the way, the complexity of puzzles quickly balloons, to the point of being mind bending and headache inducing. But of course, I wouldnt have the game any other way. I personally wasnt interested in dedicating a huge amount of time to Baba is You and used a guide for any puzzle that sufficiently stumped me, but Id wholly recommend doing so if you get stuck, at least if you reach the point of being ready to walk away from the game, as I think its worth it to experience everything Baba is You has to offer, even if you cant solve all the puzzles on your own."

389,2689,"Fine puzzle game for all age brackets. Maybe a little overpriced for the fun factor, but still worth taking for a spin if there is a nice discount available."
390,2689,Game is best when played blind and without ever looking up the answers. Otherwise there is really no point in playing the game because it is meant to give you challenging puzzles that are rewarding to solve
391,2689,This game is excellent. The few puzzles I have managed to complete are excellent and very confusing (at least for my small brain).
392,2689,too much thinking
393,2689,"A unique puzzle game that requires you to think outside the box, inside the box, and as the box.  It's a simple combination of spatial maneuvering with words and logic gates.  It's very simple to pick up and play and has tons of puzzle that will stretch your mind in different ways and have a wide variety despite all relying on a single puzzle mechanic. Despite being single player, it's also very fun to play with a group arguing and brainstorming over the harder puzzles.  The concept and screenshots may look simplistic, but the charming artstyle/music and amount of content make it well worth the price."

398,2688,you will have to look up some of the puzzles. really great puzzle game
399,2688,brain hurts a lot owie owie owie
400,2688,"This is one of those games I wish I had thought of. A supremely elegant puzzle design where it seems no matter how many twists you discover in the mechanics there are always more.Some things I liked, a non-exhaustive list:1. A lot of ""endgame"" content. I don't want to spoil what I call the endgame at all, only to say that what you first think of the endgame is not the endgame. I guarantee you that you will have no idea what it is about to be if you haven't played before.2. Puzzles that strike a good balance between difficult and fun. Too many puzzlers can't seem to hit this fine line, and usually on the side of too difficult. These puzzles, however, are more about exploring interesting, surprising, or fun elements of the mechanics, rather than trying to impress the player with how smart the designer is. The ""aha"" moments come at the right time, so there's enough of a struggle to make the success feel special but not so much that you feel frustrated and stupid for not thinking of the solution earlier. That said there are some absolute brain melters in here but they are optional and you can get to every ending without solving those.3. Nothing was left on the table. I am not smart enough to know if there's a better word for this idea, but I mean by this that every mechanic and rule in the game was explored fully and and it didn't feel like any necessary mechanics or rules were left out. Yes, a level editor lets us all make our own puzzles but I don't think any of us are going to create something that was truly missing from this game. This reminds me of how Jonathan Blow's puzzle games leave no stone unturned, though Baba Is You doesn't have the same... well... pretentiousness. So if you're playing and you think ""a neat puzzle mechanic would be..."" then it's probably in the game.4. I mentioned the level editor. I like games with level editors (provided it makes sense for the game). Again, it's rare that user-generated content will ever be better than the game it comes from. But this game is inspiring and I want to be able to tinker with the mechanics myself, even if my puzzles are too easy or not all that interesting. Who knows, maybe you'll come up with your own idea for a game from messing with the editor.5. Many puzzles have multiple solutions. Not all, but many. And it never really feels like you're cheating by finding an alternate solution. Usually any unintended solution will be much, much more difficult than what I think is the intended one anyway. But it's nice that the developers let us do it.6. There's something haunting about the ""true ending."" Don't want to spoil it. You're just going to have to find it.10/10"
401,2688,"If you're looking for an incredible puzzle game with genius puzzles that literally break the common rules of any puzzle game, then look no further than Baba is You. On the surface an extremely simple concept, but there are so many layers to the mechanics of this game.A simple sentence 'Baba is You' allows you to control the character Baba. But what if Baba is replaced with a rock, a bird, a skull, a tree or... nothing? Every single puzzle is unique and loads of them are extremely challenging and fun to figure out.Yes you'll get stumped... a lot. But persevere and you'll have one of the best puzzle experiences you can have; absolutely guarenteed.Highly recommended."

409,2688,"Okay I think I can say this is one of the best puzzle games I've played. I've gotten through most of the map now. Some seriously hard puzzles, some fun and easier puzzles that teach you the way, and lots of interesting mechanics. You get to make the rules for the game, which leaves a lot of creativity for finding solutions. It's an easy game to play, where you can do one puzzle over your morning coffee, or sit all evening cracking the tough ones with your boo. Did you ever play Chips Challenge as a kid? Serious vibes of that game. If you like puzzles, you should add this one to your library. Is the game getting too hard for you? Try Googling ""Baba is Hint"". There's currently a really good spoiler-free fan site that offers broad commentary and very gentle nudges to help get your wheels turning. Half the time the hints are stuff I've reasoned out anyway, but when I'm really stuck, it's nice to have a plain comment that turns my eye towards one thing or another. Don't like hints? Hey at least you're not looking up answers. No one is judging you - just enjoy the game!"

Your reward for completing a level is a small amount of dopamine, then another level.It's the kind of game I'd love to play on a train on the way back from work, like Minesweeper or Sudoku. But why are there worlds? Why not just let me select from a list on my phone so I can play one map, then quit, then repeat the next day?"

461,2686,Such a creative game! Really love how ingenious the puzzles are.
462,2686,"It's really fun, and the main gimmick of the pushable words is really unique. Don't let the cute characters fool you, though, it is HARD. You will inevitably wind up looking up guides for a level at one point or another. The first few levels are easy, and introduce you to the mechanics of the game. From there, the first real world is quite hard -- but apparently not hard enough, as going forward, each world is harder and harder. Don't get me wrong, it's fun, but only if, after around two hours of trying to find the solution for that one level, you finally give up and look for a guide, or some hints at least.Oh yeah, and having a level editor (in beta at the time of this review) is just amazing. There's so much you can do with the level editor that doesn't get done in the main game, as long as you're creative enough."

465,2686,amazing game!
466,2686,"I recommend this game to pretty much everyone. Not gonna lie, it gets really effin' hard at some point, but the way the designer builds you up on new mechanics as the game progresses is a work of art.

470,2686,"First I want to say that the concept behind the game is brilliant and fresh, but the level design just feels too restrictive too often.I really want to like this game but I just can't. Past the first few areas the levels get so convoluted that it's just not fun anymore and feels more like taking an exam rather than playing a game.Like someone before me already wrote, it's usually not about figuring out a solution consistent with previous rules, instead you just have to look for the one trick the developer wants you to use, without the chance for for figuring out an alternate solution for yourself."

526,2685,"Amazing game. It's the best kind of puzzle game because the fun/difficulty isn't unraveling unreasonable complexity or spending sufficient hours to reach a solution - instead, you must continuously challenge the base assumptions that you made about the game from the start. It allows each puzzle to be a new kind of Eureka! moment where you keep pushing yourself further outside the box.No spoilers, but there are also a couple very appropriate ""WHAT?"" moments in the game."

533,2685,"Game has a very interesting concept. If you can think like a programmer or think abstractly, the game might be worth it for you. For me however, about halfway through the game the puzzles got far too abstract for me. It was hard to know how to approach them. The game loses its value if you use guides, but it also loses its value if you can't start it yourself either. Cool game, but I cannot recommend it for most users."
534,2685,"This rabbit hole goes really deep. Deeper than you think. The things this game does with its rules gets pretty darn crazy.Most of the rules are self-explanatory, but some are not obvious in how they interact with you and other objects, which can make some puzzles frustrating and lead to ""What! That's how that works?!""In general though, they're all very enjoyable and some make good use of misdirection. Getting past that one puzzle you were stuck on for days and being able to say that you figured it all out on your own is something that makes you feel vry smrt.If you're prone to looking things up you might not get as much enjoyment out of this aspect of the game.... because it's a puzzle game. The whole purpose of the game is the puzzles. Don't look up solutions. Brace yourself, improve and overcome."
535,2684,A very simple and enjoyable game.
536,2684,"A great game to challenge your brain. But, it's not fun. A very short burst of happiness over solving a puzzle is not worth the hour solving it. If this looks like your type of game or you want to solve hard puzzles, totally for you. People who like games because they are fun, not for you."
537,2684,"Already thought this game was wonderful and innovative, came back to finish it a while later and found a certain secret area which blew my mind all over again. Strong recommend, worth full price for sure."

545,2684,One of the most creative puzzle games ever made
546,2684,"Most of the way done (~170 solved) and around 25 hours in, this is probably my favorite puzzle game. The puzzles are surprisingly varied given how many of them there are, and even after all this time I'm figuring out new mechanic combinations I missed earlier in the game. Baba Is You does an excellent job of letting the player experiment and discover, and while some of the tricks may be difficult to discover, the puzzle design is tight enough to guide you there eventually. Mostly. Curse you, that one level that I've been stuck on for ages. Easy 10/10, probably my favorite puzzle game and amongst my favorite games regardless of genre."

553,2683,Good puzzle game.
554,2683,"Baba is You is an extremely unique game. Its not an easy game, by any stretch of the imagination, but a very interesting one to play nonetheless. The simplest way to describe it to say that it's a Sokoban game where alongside the blocks themselves you can move around individual pieces of logic which define how a level is played in the first place. So, for instance, you can push a key into a door to open it. But, guess what, the logical statement that defines that the door blocks your way and that it can be opened with a key is right there in the level you are navigating and it is made of movable blocks. So, instead of dealing with a key you can move the logic blocks to form a different sentence, defining that the door is not locked. Or that instead of your character you are now controlling the door and so you can move it around to the target area to win. Or that the door *is* the target area, so you can just walk into it to win. Or that the door is both target area *and* you so you will win instantly. Etc etc etc, I think you got the idea.Often this all gives you a huge amount of creative freedom in solving each level. But it's not a goofy free for all, of course(though it can be, at times), and there are a lot of ways level design can limit all(or most of) the insta-win rule interactions to make you actually think hard to solve the puzzle. Unfortunately, this some times leads to a rather frustrating experience where only a very specific and highly unobvious solution will work but such is the way of things, I suppose, when it comes to such puzzle games."

564,2683,Possibly the coolest game I've ever played. Very hard tho...
565,2683,"This puzzle game offers interesting mechanics where you change the rules, the puzzles are very challenging so getting stuck on certain levels is to be expected. You can skip some levels you struggle with and still continue progress through the game, which is a nice touch."
566,2683,i  suck
567,2683,very good
568,2683,"Amazing puzzle game, so many aha moments, especially after reaching the meta maps"
569,2683,good gameyes
570,2682,"The premise is simple, but each level is so cleverly thought out, from the easy tutorial levels, to the mind-benders that make you build upon what you have learned. And make no mistake, this game gets HARD. You'll spend a lot of time feeling really stupid, and then a lot of time feeling really smart.I actually found this to be great ""couch co-op"", so to speak--having more than one brain looking at the same puzzle can sometimes get past the brick walls of not seeing the solution. It's at least knowing that if you find yourself thinking in circles, take a break and come back with fresh eyes. The great thing is that the non-linear level progression allows you to do this--you can hop from level to level, and even world to world, without having completed every single thing you have access to so far."
571,2682,i  hate this gameevery level wants you to do something impossible but apparently there's a lot of impossible to go around
572,2682,This game is good but it's too hard for me.
573,2682,baba is confusing
574,2682,"excellent level design, fun challenge, highly rewarding and fun!"
575,2682,"An obvious must have for anyone who enjoys puzzle games -- this long in, a year or two after buying it, there are still a dozen or so puzzles that I'm stuck on. The ways in which the objects and qualifiers get used to solve the puzzles definitely makes the solutions very satisfying to come to!"
576,2682,it's really fun but almost too hard for my dumbass
577,2682,BABA IS WIN!
578,2682,"best game ever, probably"
579,2682,oh god it's so hard
580,2682,i love this game its so fun its hard but not to hard
581,2682,"A great puzzle game. Sometimes I go back to puzzles I thought for certain only had one solution and find that there were so many more. The only frustrating part is that some of the interactions are not terribly intuitive. For example, an object sinking destroying the fluid medium is arbitrary nonsense, but fine once you know that's what'll happen."
582,2682,I think I am stupid.
583,2682,Baba is youBaba is win
584,2682,I knew for a long time that I was stupid. This game removes any suspicion to the contrary.Great game.
585,2682,very cool puzzle gamebaba :D
586,2682,All game should be at this level
587,2682,Made my brain bleed. Allowed me to see in 4 dimensions. Buy if you like feeling stupid.
588,2682,"BABA is YOU is a delightful puzzle game where the rules of the game are objects on screen that can usually be PUSHed around. The music and aesthetic are on point, and the mechanics of the game feel solid and allow for huge possibilities, especially with the level editor.The game is brutally difficult at times though. It has exposed many limitations of my monke brain. Generally I'd either find the solution to a level within 10 minutes, or it would take over 4 hours, or I never found it. At most one or two levels were somewhere in between, out of hundreds.Is BABA too difficult? I'd say a little bit. There's plenty of hints and guides online though, and honestly if it weren't as difficult as it is, I think that would only be because the developers underused the game's possibilities.BABA is definitely worth your money, go buy it. Now if you don't mind, I'm going to keep on figuring out how to remake Flappy Bird with the level editor."
589,2682,game is fun
590,2682,Baba is Win and Awesome. This is a challenging puzzle game that provides many hours of entertainment for the whole family (ages 6+). Highly recommended.
591,2682,Kidney stone simulator.
592,2682,"Really good game, but really hard for people like me - I had to use all 5 of my brain cells"
593,2682,"Really interesting puzzle game. Very creative and requires a lot of ""thinking outside the box"". I have yet to finish it but it's been a lot of fun so far, and for the price i would definitely recommend it. If you like complex puzzle games go for it, you won't be disappointed !"
594,2681,game is goodsoundtrack is better
595,2681,"A lot of self-described puzzle games boil themselves down into operation-based and others that border on being more mystery games than not.Baba is You uses a simple logic-based mechanism (through text) to create logic puzzles that don't entirely feel like logic-puzzles due to the adorably quirky presentation and incredibly intuitive mechanics of ""You make the rules through changing the text order!""It's an amazing game, and incredibly cathartic when you solve something you've been staring at for hours.Definitely recommend, Player is Dumb."
596,2681,Great game. VERY BEEEEEEEEEG BRAIN GAME
597,2681,Really great puzzle game. You gotta think out of the box for this one.
598,2681,"Baba Is You is this devilish application of simple logic puzzle concepts in increasingly complex and sometimes ludicrous arrangements. How much simpler could you get than having all the game's rules spelled out for you via text blocks? In many ways, Baba is actually more of a programming puzzle game than a standard logic puzzler, with how you rewrite the rules on-the-fly to suit your needs. It's very simple. Baba Is You, unless you move one of the blocks, then nobody is you - you're dead. Other characters and inanimate objects alike can be used as the player character in this way, just substitute Baba for another object. Collision, pushability, meltiness, and even invisibility are all dictated by the rule blocks. and for a while, the game plays around with these ideas in a charming and approachable way. In fact, most of the main world's puzzles aren't extraordinarily difficult. Hard, sure, but not unreasonable to a layperson such as myself. Then you find your first alternate solution, and the game you thought you knew starts to fall apart at the seams. Increasingly mind-bending, devious puzzles present themselves as you descend into a recursive purgatory, where the only escape is to continue downward. Saying more than that would be a spoiler. But despite the skyrocketing difficulty that awaits completionists, the game is *never* unfair. Every rule you need to know is laid out for you, and there is no penalty for messing up or taking as long as you like to solve a level. Every level in itself is quite short once you know the solution, but remember, this isn't a race. Every solution awaits you if you apply some trial and error and some clever thinking. Baba Is You is the closest I've had a game feel to the lawlessness of real life.If you're a fan of thoughtfully made puzzle games, I simply cannot recommend this game enough. While it's more down the alley of SpaceChem rather than, say, Myst or Chip's Challenge, anyone who enjoys puzzle games on the whole will find Baba Is You a stimulating - and cute - experience. The soundtrack is lovely too."
599,2681,"A very enjoyable, if difficult, puzzle game.Every level has a set of rules defined by adjacent blocks of words.You can move some of these blocks to change the rules to your advantage and win.The game can be very difficult sometimes but always enjoyable.Recommended to all puzzle lovers."
600,2681,Yoyoyo
601,2681,I have never enjoyed destroying my brain more.
602,2681,9/10 interesting puzzles and brainy solutions. This game is visually appealing and mentally stimulating.
603,2681,Best puzzle game I've ever played.
604,2681,"Baba Is You is extremely deep, totally original and man... is it hard. This is a game, where you push boxes while thinking outside the box. It gets you 'thinking with portals' in its own way. You start as a complete virgin and overwhelmed, watch your brain melt away but at the end of the day you may have broadend your mind. Sometimes I wished you'd only have to figure out the logic component of the puzzles and not the execution part where you push stuff around, because I'm not particularily good at that. But more often than not are those axis intertwined. And multiple rooms have more than one solution. That leaves one question. What is more mind-bending: The puzzles or trying to imagine what it would take to design them?"
605,2681,you is youbuy and review is winreview is goodbuy is cheapnot buy is defeat
606,2681,
607,2681,"This game is so incredibly fun. It is a must have if you like logic puzzles and charming sprites. The puzzles all make you think super far outside the box, and can get really hard. The high difficulty however, isnt annoying whatsoever! The rate at which it teaches you about the game is very well balanced with the difficulty curve, and each level teaches you a new way to manipulate the rules and make each puzzle your own, making for a consistently difficult but doable puzzle game, and that paired with the adorable and charming sprites and the absolutely hilarious ways that the game deals with certain scenarios makes this one of my favorite games of all time only ten hours in!"
608,2681,The Good:Very creative puzzle game.Tons of content.Actually really damn hard.The Bad:Does not introduce you to certain concepts very smoothly.
609,2681,why does this game keep calling me baba my name is john
610,2681,"This minimalist, logic-based game requires players to change the rules in increasingly challenging puzzles laid out in an overworld map. Its premise seems simple at first but each puzzle is unique while naturally building the player's skill set. The bones of this game are strong and complex even if the aesthetic doesn't match. If anyone knows of any games similar to this I'd love to hear some recs!"
611,2681,What
612,2681,"BRAINBABAisHARDisMELTLOVEIt's one of the hardest and the most exciting puzzle games I have had so far. The beginning is simple enough for everyone to try. But if you like challenging puzzles, then go for all 226(!) levels, I dare you.To be honest, I would never pay attention to this game because its art and sound style is so simplified. And it would be a shame to miss it! So thanks a lot to my friend for the recommendation, which made me look closer."
613,2681,good puzzle game
614,2681,"Tied for my personal favorite game of all time, alongside Talos Principle and The Witness.But this might edge those out. It's honestly basically the perfect game for a high IQ puzzle genius like me. If you're a puzzle-hound with an astronomically high IQ, I think you'll really like this. If you're a dumb butt, uh, yikes. You might want to stick with pick up sticks and Tic Tac Toe.And by the way, morans, I'm kidding around. I mean I'm a pretty smart guy but this game kicks your buttock and I had to cheat on about 5 puzzles so far. Honestly, I'm kind of a moran.This is a Puzzle Masterpiece. If not the puzzle masterpiece. That's not hyperbole. It's a great game for the first 30 hours, and it becomes a masterpiece during the last 20 as it really just keeps introducing brilliant puzzles all the way into the last segment of the game. The puzzle writers truly love the genre and really have taken this to another level.And if you're like me, and you find a lot of games boring as an adult after a few hours, but love stuff that really engages that logical part of your brain in a fun way, this is going to be a 10/10 for you and probably the best you can find."
615,2681,baba is you is a cool game
616,2680,aaaaaaaaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
617,2680,good.
618,2680,Best puzzle game I've ever played.
619,2680,Baba makes my head go VBFBUCHYG!
620,2680,"Well, I am stupid as hell"
621,2680,A must-buy for anyone who enjoys puzzle games
622,2680,This game is really innovative and really works on your lateral thinking.
623,2680,"Baba Is You takes the complex world of coding and turns it into a simple idea.  Of course, being a puzzle game, these simple ideas get complex very quickly.  While I have played plenty of puzzle games in the past, a good amount of levels in this game had me stumped.  Of course, like all other puzzle games, I eventually started to understand the mechanics of each level, which helped me push further into the game.  With more than 200 levels, it took me quite a while for me to fully comprehend the clever gimmicks within each stage.  I imagine puzzle experts would definitely be able to 100% complete this game faster than I did, but I still believe even then the playtime more than makes up for the asking price, especially with the addition of a level creator/editor."
624,2680,head hurt
625,2680,"One of the Best puzzle games I've ever Played. All the Puzzles were very creative and unique, makes you think out of the box all the time. There were many times I had spent trying to figure out the solution to a puzzle and the answer was so simple I felt very stupid.The Art style is Very Cute and the lever designs are very neatIn other words: Baba Is Good"
626,2680,"It's a tough puzzler, incredibly well thought out"
627,2680,"Great concept and puzzles. My favorite puzzle game from the last 3-4 years.Edit after playing a few dozen more levels - the game just gets better and better. I'm blown away by the quality of the puzzles. Playing with a group can be a lot of fun!Edit after playing many, many levels and nearing the end of the game. Baba is You is a magnum opus - never have I played a puzzle game that so thoroughly challenges expectations, whose solutions so thoroughly rely on subverting expectations, and whose solutions are thus so incredibly satisfying. My son and I played together and we each contributed ideas to get ourselves unstuck. ""Maybe we're looking at this backwards"" he said once, referring to our assumption that Baba and Keke needed to be placed in a certain order, and realizing that reversing their positions would give us what we needed - that sentiment captures the utter simplicity yet mind boggling difficulty of the game's puzzles. Backwards, upside-down, inside-out - each puzzle seems to find a new way to force the player to change how they think.Baba is You is easily the best puzzle game I've ever played and now ranks among the top 5 games I've played in my life, ever. (For the curious, others include Starcraft, Slay the Spire, and City of Heroes... kind of an eclectic lot.)"
628,2680,yes.
629,2680,"I think the game is hard and hurt my cranium, and my teeth"
630,2680,[game] [is] [good]
631,2680,An actually difficult puzzle game. Fun mechanics and they really go for it.
632,2680,Brain is dead
633,2680,The best puzzle game i've ever played.
634,2680,Baba is you is a puzzle game that allows you to alter the rules of the levels themselves with some genuinely hard puzzles if you like puzzle games id recommend Baba is You
635,2680,"Baba is You was unique for me, because unlike other puzzle games, whenever you start a level you start thinking : "" This is impossible. This one doesn't have a solution. And then you try a million things and you think "" Yep. This one is bugged. "" and then you find the solution and you either feel dumb or smart.When you feel dumb, the level was okay, when you feel smart, they were usually excellent.I vastly prefer the levels that are about interesting logic and attribute problems to the ones relying on the block moving itself, but there is more than enough variety either way.Great puzzle game."
636,2679,Baba is YouFlag is WinGame is Awesome!
637,2679,"So many  brain farts, I love it!"
638,2679,GAME is GOODBUY GAME is YOUCONCEPT is CLEVERGAME is PLAYBABA is YOU
639,2679,It's a good game
640,2679,"I am going to need a 12-step program soon because this game is beyond addicting!  It reminds me of a simpler time when problems were solved with logic rather than semi-automatic weapons.  This game challenges your brain, not your trigger finger and, in this day and age, the brains of most people are atrophying due to lack of use.  The only problem with that I have with Baba is You is that it keeps track of the length of time you play and realizing that you have spent 5 hours playing instead of sleeping is kind of embarrassing."
641,2679,If you like solving problems other than your own there is no better game. Baba is Excellent!
642,2679,"Fun and engaging puzzles, plus a super cute art style."
643,2679,Me am dumb
644,2679,"Game is Hard,Brain is Melt,I recommend."
645,2679,Absolutely phenomenal. Mindbending and satisfying
646,2679,"Easily the best puzzle game ever made.Baba balances a super easy to understand control scheme and ruleset with an insanely in-depth number of mechanics. The game is welcoming to people who have never played video games before, but has so much content that any person who touches it will come across plenty of challenges.Arguably the best thing about Baba's puzzle design is that the rules and layout of every level is completely shown to the player, and the game moves at your own pace- so there's never any rush or tests of skill to get through a level. Everything purely relies on your ability to solve logic puzzles and nothing else.Please play this game if you have ever enjoyed puzzle games in any form whatsoever."
647,2679,"Its a good game, but it gets way too hard way too soon. It doesn't just have a difficulty curve, it has an EXPONENTIAL difficulty curve. Do not buy unless you like a challenge! But other than that, I HIGHLY recommend."
648,2679,Baba is happy
649,2679,"This is a very creative concept. Can't say I've ever seen something like it before. In this game, you can change the roles of objects in the room and turn objects into other objects by pushing the nouns and verbs in the level around - you can even make these text blocks themselves interact with other room objects, if the [Text] noun is available. Solving the puzzles requires some very unintuitive mode of thinking; you have to un-learn a lot of what video games have taught you over the years, and constantly remind yourself of the fact that you can change the rules at any time and that the point is figuring out a way to change the rules that gets you where you want to be. That might mean making walls pass-through, changing which object in the room you control, making a key open a solid wall instead of a door, or simply stating that the object you control wins the level if you touch it, thereby instantly doing so.And all of that stuff happens in just the first world.This is one of these puzzle games that tie knots into your brain in the best way possible. Absolutely worth your cash and time."
650,2679,my 3 remaining braincells have to work very hard to solve some of the levels.very cool and definitely something for people who like solving puzzles
651,2679,"This is a really smart puzzler that has a deceptively simple rule set but requires some really lateral problem solving. That makes it stand out from a lot of other puzzle games that require a more logical approach. There are loads of levels and it will take many many hours to complete them all.Some of the solutions make you feel really clever when you solve them, which is the Holy Grail for any game like this. They really stretch the limits of the rules that the game sets to an impressive degree.I have to admit that I did go online for walkthroughs on a handful of occasions. Sometimes I really kicked myself for not seeing the clue to the problem, but other times the solutions were so left-field that I can honestly say I would never have figured them out myself. In fact, I ultimately didn't finish the game when I did a walkthrough and still couldn't figure out why a solution would apply. Mebbe I'm just thick.Anyway, a definite recommendation but expect a hard challenge."
652,2679,baba is hard
653,2678,"Full review hereBriefly: Baba is You is a brilliant puzzle game that takes its core conceit as far as it will go. Many of harder the puzzle solutions make you feel like you're exploiting bugs in the game, even though they're quite deliberate. This game will provide you with many hours of exquisite mental anguish."

673,2678,Baba is fun
674,2678,Very creative and super challenging.
675,2678,A masterpiece that shows you many concepts without drifting away from the core gameplay
676,2678,"Absolutely recommend! This game expertly manages progression, with each chapter you learn new rules (and ways of bending them!) while never feeling out of your depth or it being to easy. Another great thing about this game is that you can pick and choose which puzzles you play in order to make progress, so on the rare occasions that you cannot solve a puzzle no matter how hard you try, you can just try another one without any consequences. And even in those cases I have come back and been able to complete them with no  problem at all, because that is how well managed the learning curve is. The immense satisfaction of bending the rules of the game into completing puzzles, cannot be emphasised enough, and trust me sometimes you'll question whether you're meant to be doing what your doing, and then find out that was solution all along. I thoroughly implore you to try this game, the art style and music are all fitting as well, and I love how game progression is displayed as traversing an island! The only two pieces of advice are this:, Firstly, just experiment, you can always reset and undo actions, and you'd be surprised the amount of new things you can discover to help complete the puzzle by just messing around. Secondly, keep at the puzzles, they never ever seem obvious at first, but when you do keep at it and solve it you feel absolutely great about yourself, in hours of playing I have only ever had to skip 2 puzzles. Trust me the solutions are always attainable. To those who do decide to play this game, have fun!"
677,2678,"One of the best puzzle games I have played in yearsMind-warpingly fun, endless engaging logic puzzles, and perfect game to play with friends as you attempt to push your brainal cavity to its extremes. Also somehow replayable, as I have managed to forget all of the solutions on a second playthrough with a great modding community."
678,2678,Just Don't
679,2678,"10/10There's a number of people that like to meme about this being ""the Dark Souls of puzzle games,"" but to an extent, they actually have a point.This game is HARD AS BALLS. The game is challenging enough if you do the bare minimum, but if you want the true ending, you're in for quite the journey. Without spoiling too much - the game gets very, very meta with its puzzles and forces you to think beyond individual levels.Yet, it all springs from something incredibly simple: the mixing and matching of different game rules, which are made of 3 word sentences like, ""FLAG IS WIN"" or ""BABA IS YOU."" You take those two, and switch them around, and suddenly you're playing as a flag that's trying to reach Baba in order to beat the level. Or maybe you make it into ""FLAG IS BABA"" and your flag turns INTO a Baba. And as more words are added with their own unique mechanics, and you begin having to mix and match more and more different things in different ways, you start to really get an appreciation for just how deep and complex this game really is despite the very simple premise.If you're into super tough puzzle games, you'll love Baba Is You. It's a masterpiece of a game, but with its level of difficulty, it's inevitably going to be difficult or impossible for some to get into."
680,2677,"If you think that problem solving and intelligence is a main component of the brain, then yes. This game is a good exercise or test for you to be able to solve problems given the circumstances/challenges.Although there are many more games out there available. I do personally like this game because the artwork is cute. I'm 46 btw. what did i just wrote lmao stop reading this ridiculous review just play the game"
681,2677,"Probably the best ever puzzle game for programmers, both experienced and aspiring.This game will teach you how to learn and follow new rules, and then how to think out of the box and bend those rules to your will. In other words, player will develop or reinforce certain way of thinking, approaching the problems at hand, that would transition and help them in real life, and that is actually amazing.And in addition to that, it's extremely fun and aesthetically appealing!Note: some of the advanced puzzle levels may be very tiring after long time periods of solving, so make sure to take breaks if you're stuck! Just don't cheat! It's part of the learning process! Dopamine release awaits you only if you solve it by yourself!"

711,2676,Hard game but very fun and tricky! In short has stuff and like code thing to be Dwayne rock
712,2676,"Baba is a great and creative puzzler that does eventually get difficult, but also opens up more and more interesting possibilities as one progresses."
713,2676,"What a smart gameSome of the solutions I've found were so hacky, I wonder if it's intendedLeaves a big smile on my face nonethelessGreat job"
714,2676,BABA IS WONDERFULA challenging and cute puzzle game that is a must play to get that brain of ours turning inside out.
715,2676,Baba is Confused
716,2676,"BABA IS HOT          EXPECTATIONS IS MELTONCOMPUTERISWINAhhhh, that joke aside, I don't know how to explain how much I love this game. This is one of those games that I just had to do everything. I took several (I believe three) hiatus periods of a month or more from this game, as it became increasingly frustrating (read: challenging), but I'm glad I always came back to it and I'm glad I finished it. I don't have many games at 100% steam achievement, but with this one I had to.Puzzle games are not my favorite genre, but I do play enough of them, and this is one of the best. The way the logic works in the game challenged me to no end and continually forced me to think outside the box. There were so many ah-HA! moments in this game. It reminded me of how I felt about The Talos Principle when I had certain revelations. After I had my very first major game-breaking ah-HA! moment, I was so very proud of myself, and thought that it would soon be over. Nope. The game just keeps going and going, continually increasing in complexity.At times, levels in this game are fairly simple, even later on, and there is no difficulty in solving them. However, spending two hours on a level was not a rare occurrence for me. Much later in the game, I decided I had to set a 30 minute time-limit for myself, to stop myself from going crazy. After that I would get a hint, and look up the solution if I was completely stuck. The solutions and out of the box thinking just get so crazy, that I don't think I would have ever completed this game if I didn't do this. I recommend a similar system to anyone who is finding themselves stuck in this game. If you 100% completed this game with no-assistance in under 100 hours, you are a genius, or I'm not very good at thinking outside the box.The visuals in this game are so simple, but I really appreciated them. The music is also great and quite simple, but is not repetitive in an annoying way."
717,2676,"Best ""think outside the box"" puzzle game I know. Instead of just giving you very complicated puzzles, each level usually consists of a small, managable amount of variables, but requires you to figure out a trick before being able to solve it. I spent may weeks attempting the same level again and again, being sure that it's literally unsolvable and then laughing at my stupidity for not figuring out the ""obvious"" solution in hind sight.If you decide to play this, I highly recommend sticking with it and not cheating. No other game delivers such a feeling of accomplishment after you finally figured out how to solve this one particular level after days or weeks of attempting it - just to be stuck again five minutes later at the next one."
718,2676,Ich bin zu dumm fr dieses Spiel.10/10 Wrde nochmal verzweifeln.
719,2676,this game makes my brain expand in size
720,2676,Probably best logic game I've played
721,2675,Best game ever.
722,2675,baba is fun
723,2675,Good game
724,2675,"This is the best puzzle game I have ever played. There is so much content for the $15 I payed for this game that I never came to regret my purchase. whenever I showed this game to a couple of my friends one weekend we were just dying of laughter because of all the absurd interactions this game has to offer. I was also blown away whenever I discovered some of the secrets of this game. I have completed every level in Baba is You using hints only twice and it still provided me with 57 hours of a brilliant puzzle experience, get this game now."
725,2675,"This game is great - it's very creative and the art style is charming, which deceives as to how difficult this game us. Some puzzles took three of us in a discord call together with me streaming the game in order to figure out. It's definitely worth checking out if you enjoy puzzlers."
726,2675,one of the best puzzle games i have ever played. with expertly crafted puzzles and a great soundtrack while you play through them.10/10 game.
727,2675,A must buy if you love puzzle games.
728,2675,Total mind.
729,2675,Awesome
730,2675,"2020 Speedy Review CleanupI'm very familiar with programming and yet Baba is You is very difficult to wrap your head around at times. Part of it is because the puzzles don't always have an intuition to them. When programming, you have set rules and commands, and you can use the commands to do what you want so long as you follow the rules.This game instead lets you program by restructuring the rules, but in a way it's ""random."" Because the rules you start with aren't always the same, and you might have to jump through a bunch of hoops to get something just the right way.When programming, you generally have set ways to transform objects, and you're able to start things at a broader level and then optimize it later. This game, especially for tougher puzzles, requires you to figure out the optimized solution from the beginning - and the ""optimization"" of changing rules is very confusing.So in my opinion, much more difficult than programming! That said, it's a unique puzzle game and well worth a try."
731,2675,fun
732,2675,"One of the best puzzle games. Very challenging, but it feels incredibly satisfying when you solve a level that's got you stumped. Many of the levels really made me admire the devs' creativity."
733,2675,"This game is crazy in the best possible way. The puzzles in here are the most brain breaking puzzles I have ever seen in a game, and the dev deserves massive credit for creating these levels that force you to think outside the box in ways I could have never dreamed. As I have heard from other reviewers, this game makes you think you've outsmarted it, only for you to realize that was what you were supposed to do all along and you actually just learned a new mechanic. It really is a masterful game that really can't be compared to anything else out there."
734,2675,"Baba Is You is a must buy for puzzle fans, its rules are very simple but are able to create engaging and difficult puzzles within the interactions of these rules."
735,2675,"Question: what's the difference between a puzzle game and leetcode?For some people, there probably isn't one. They're both structured problem solving activities with graded difficulty.For me, the difference is something like intuition. A puzzle game creates it's own vocabulary, shows you how its elements interact, and even if you'd have a hard time describing them precisely in words, you have a good sense of what they'll do at any given point.Coding is the opposite: you have an exact documentation of what each function or operator does, and if you develop some sort of intuition about them, you do so at your own risk. Baba is You is solidly on the code side of things. The names of properties are irrelevant at best; I found they made it harder to remember what they actually did. I intellectually understand what each of them does, but there's no intuition involved. There's some interesting manipulations you can do, but the game doesn't know how to show you any of them. It just puts the pieces there and hopes you figure it out.If this game scratched an itch for you, consider learning to code. It's just as much of a game and you can actually get paid to do it."
736,2675,one of the cleverest mechanics in a puzzle game veru good
737,2675,this game hurts my brain in a good way. 10/10.
738,2675,"One of the best puzzle game that combines Sokoban (box-pushing) element and rule-writing together to create a very innovative gameplay. You will manipulate the rules of each level to change behaviors of things in it and come up with a solution to the presented puzzle. Starting off simple enough to act as some sort of tutorial levels, the difficulty will increase as you go into the later levels and you might feel a little bit stumped but you can solve the puzzles at your own pace and skip it and come back later once you have more understanding of the tricks needed to solve the problems. Because, the game will try to teach you tips and tricks progressively thru the puzzles as you go on, so some levels might be better saved for later. The puzzles are really clever and many of them are memorable as well. Some puzzles do really create a feeling of  programming quiz but they'll almost always come with the Sokoban aspects.Lastly, I can't forget to praise the fitting visual and music, all of which are done by the sole developer, Hempuli.PS. Fans of this might want to check out Environmental Station Alpha from the same developer as well. (IF YOU LOVE SECRETS)"
739,2675,is baba me?am i baba?the world may never know....very nice gamefunbut a bit challengingi enjoy
740,2675,Recommend is yes!
741,2675,"Despite how frustrated I might get with my inability to solve some of the levels, I think the concept for the whole game is just so unique and fun I can't stay mad at it for long. This game isn't for the casual puzzler"
742,2675,"I recommend this game but to be honest, I had a horrible time with it. Just dreadful. I always suspected that I'm not the sharpest tool in the shed but I was not ready for what this game did to my brain. I still think that everyone should experience it just because it's one of the most creative titles I've played in my 30 years of gaming but yeah, kinda hard this one. Ouch."

751,2674,i like the rabbit but i hate the puzzles
752,2674,this game made me realize i'm really stupid (i knew i was stupid before but i now know i'm really stupid)
753,2674,The game itself is incredibly unique and fun. Fun and unique does not mean easy. Some levels take a lot of time and thinking to solve. Don't go into this game expecting to effortlessly breeze through every level.
754,2674,This game made me break out into manic giggling when I worked out a concept more times than I can count.
755,2674,"Innovative, cute, but bloody hard. I can't recommend it to anyone who doesn't like repeatedly spending hours banging their head on a single puzzle (or cheating). I'm going to be a combo breaker here and not give this a mindless, meme-laden positive review. Note that the majority of people lauding the game have single-digit playtimes. This game would require a bare minimum of thirty hours to 100% without walkthroughs.Baba is You is the Dark Souls of puzzle games. Victories are sweet, but the process of getting there is frustrating and time-consuming. In fact, like many Dark Souls bosses, the puzzles here seem impossible and often require taking a mental health break before another round of attempts.Each area starts out with 1-3 puzzles of easy to moderate difficulty that introduce a new and straightforward mechanic. However, the dozen or more puzzles after that spike in complexity, are rarely intuitive (even if you understand the goal and problem) and require that you find a single solution way to ""break"" mechanics to win.I'll summarize and close with a car metaphor:Assume you've never been in a car before.Puzzles 1-3 teach you how to use the gas pedal, brake pedal and windshield wipers on an automatic transmission car.Puzzle 4 asks you to drive a semi with manual transmission.Puzzle 5 asks you to perform a burnout on a FWD automatic transmission family sedan...in the snow.Puzzle 6 asks you to get a '76 Ford Mustang to run on propane fuel.Are all of those things possible? Yes, but they're going to require a hell of a lot of time and trial and error. If that sort of thing is your fetish, then dive right in. But everyone else needs to ignore the hype train before making a purchase."

760,2674,"This is, without a doubt, one of the best puzzle games I've ever played. The puzzles are incredibly well designed, and many allows different approaches for solving. A fun game to play in a group to, trying to figure out the solution together.Highly recommended!"
761,2674,This game is hecking hard if you don't use guides or hints. Super fun though and a good time for an acrobatic brain.

769,2674," this game.This game is evil. It will trick you into buying it, have a promising start, then after you've played enough to be unable to refund, it will start drastically dropping in its fun factor.I know the game is supposed to be hard, and I knew that while buying the game, but I was hoping it'd have at least a logical difficulty curve. BOY WAS I WRONG. The first few worlds are cool and fine, but soon the game just starts throwing at you way too many mechanics at once. Thankfully, you can beat the game quickly right? That's a good thing, right?NO ITS  NOTYou can literally any% this game BLINDLY in TWO  HOURS. And when you do, it just doesn't feel satisfying. At all.This game clearly wasn't made for me. I like puzzle games because they're a relaxing genre that I can play whenever I feel stressed out or I'm just not in the mood for my typical chaotic explosion filled goodness. But this game won't relax you. It will  torture you and give you an existential crisis.This is the biggest joke of a purchase I made in my life, and it just shows that first impressions aren't everything.I'll give it at that, some of the puzzles ARE fun, and none of them are uncreative. But they become way too obnoxius eventually.Still, I will try to give this game another chance, but so far this has been the worst purchase I ever made.4/10 I guess I don't know  this "

772,2674,Game awesome.Head hurtz.Buy now.
773,2674,"Ive been contemplating whether this is my favourite puzzle game. Opus magnum, a game I adore since I enjoy programming, has been my favourite puzzle game for a long time and I have a hard time choosing anything over ituntil Baba Is You came along. While I was deciding, this game managed to blow my mind not once, nor twice, but at least five countable instances and I have very rarely had a game continually make my brain fall out of my ears. It is also probably the most brutally hard puzzle games, just shy of SpaceChem, but much, much superior as I will explain.Baba Is You is, in my opinion, the perfect puzzle game. It has an interesting core mechanic that never becomes stale and evolves as you play through it. It also avoids something which a vast amount of puzzle games do which is what I like to call giving you a puzzle and leaving a piece in the box. What I mean by this is puzzle games tend to deliberately try and trick you, introducing bizarre interactions between elements which could never have been predicted or simply giving you an insolvable problem that you are somehow supposed to realise is insolvable and then realise you dont have all the pieces. Baba Is You is the complete opposite; everything is visible and it is up to you to find a sequence of steps to complete the level. It also does not at any point give you red herrings. I hate puzzle games that give you sensory overload with hundreds of pieces and then the solution is to use two of them. In Baba Is You, if its there, there is a good reason, even if you dont know it!The core mechanic of Baba Is You is that all the rules of a level are displayed in text form in a Sokoban/grid-like layout. You can interact with them and break, extend or even create new rules to change the goal of the level; is the flag stuck in an impenetrable wall?  make the wall no longer STOP and you can sail through; Stuck in a room with no way out?  leave your old being behind and become the wall. The possibilities of success are plentiful!I will try to avoid as many spoilers as possible as this game is at is peak when you dont know whats coming next, but if youre still on the fence, here is some more convincing. I want to firstly say that I did not do Baba Is You justice on my first partial playthrough; I gave in too quickly and looked up far too many solutions and I didnt give the game the benefit of the doubt. Upon playing the game again I realise that this game excels in experimentation; you are not going to be able to formulate all possible combinations in your head and arrive at the solution immediately. Instead, the game actively encourages you to ask questions like: what if I construct WALL IS OPEN AND SHUT?; what if WALL IS NOT WALL? Herein lies one of the biggest allies of the game, and here you may be surprised to learn that there are basically no tutorials in the game. Yes, for a game this difficult and complex, there is no hand holding. But that is not a disadvantage, in fact, the game is telling you early on to experiment, to learn what commands do, and if you want to even contemplate the hidden levels, you are going to need to know how commands interact with other commands. My one critical piece of advice is to make sure that, when introduced with a new command, to experiment fully with it; how does it interact with this command? Can I chain this with another to produce another mechanic? Is this sentence allowed? The later levels test your understanding of these rules and if you miss a core interaction, the solutions can become nearly unreachable. If you ever find yourself stuck for a long time in a level, return to some of the earlier levels and just go through them; you may find interactions with old commands that you just didnt find the first time!The soundtrack is also something I quite enjoy; Im not usually a fan of 8-bit-like music but I found myself quite enjoying myself when solving the harder levels where I spent a considerable amount of time on any one level. The developer also gives 10% of all game sales to charity, which is just the golden cherry on top of it all. The only way I can conclude this is to say: just buy the game, or in Baba Is You language: BABA ON STEAM IS BUY"

798,2673,"Rule near Baba is brokenDeveloped and published by Hempuli Oy in 2019, ""Baba Is You"" is a Sokoban-like puzzle game dependent on its own logical programming. Bending the rules and moving the goalposts (literally) becomes your best friend when trying to solve each level in multiple unintuitive but creative ways.Editor's note: Sokoban is a classic box-pushing game originating from Japan which follows a strict set of pattern recognition to solve each puzzle in a specific way. Due to the high complexity of such games, this form of puzzle is considered difficult and time-consuming. Category Rating Detailed Breakdown Design & Graphics Average cute artstyle, lovingly simplistic graphic design, comparable to learning a programming language, difficulty ramps up way too fast, too time-consuming thanks to puzzle complexity and search depth Sound & Music Good unique soundtrack composed of low-filter synths and pads, remains mostly in the background, surprisingly not annoying after longer listening, sound design fitting but nothing special, overall well done Gameplay & Controls Good satisfying puzzle solving by thinking outside the box, game traps you into obvious incorrect solutions, reverse-engineering as best solving strategy, intuitive grid-based control scheme, certain crucial aspects of puzzle rules are NEVER explained Appeal & Innovation Superb singular combination of problem-solving aspects, makes you feel dumb and smart at the same time, easy-to-understand premise masterfully executed, appeals both to kids and adults, simply fun to get into Content & Value Good Up to 40 hours of puzzle solving (if you suck as much as me), level editor regularly updated by the developer, small but active user community, reasonable pricing, no actual replay valuePersonal Score:Good(Scoring range: Poor (worst) - Bad - Average - Good - Superb (best)Personal Thoughts:Baba Is You is absolutely unique in what it set out to achieve. A hybrid of Sokoban-like box pushing and adjusting active rules to solve puzzles is something I have never heard of before. The cutesy and very child-like drawings of Baba and its(?) friends make the game even more appealing. Baba Is You is what I would describe as an almost sophisticated puzzle game, where form and function are incredibly intertwined with each other to the point of flawless execution. On the outside, the game is kept incredibly simplistic to hide that V6 engine of own programming language. And boy, does that logic compute. Subverting expectations is the name of the game. Rules are meant to be broken and rearranged. Break the game to win it. Later on, you'll start breaking the level selection screens themselves in order to access new or hidden levels. If that doesn't scream ""meta"" I don't know what does.Unfortunately, there are some downsides you have to consider. Baba Is You is possibly one of the hardest puzzle games I ever played. This is mostly due to me and my stupid way of thinking but also minorly due to the game not explaining certain aspects of itself. Specific rules generate non-intuitive sub-rules which lead to hilarious but frustrating dead ends until you read online on how the operators actually work. You will rip your hairs out in certain levels because specific Sokoban-maneuvers will have to be used and as someone who didn't play these games, I didn't even know they existed until I looked them up. The game can be very frustrating in that regard but very rewarding when done right. Even if Baba Is You seems as hard as learning a new programming language and you cursing at your coding because it doesn't work the way you want it to, it is incredibly fun to play casually. Just don't go in with the expectation that you will just ace every level in less than 5 minutes."
799,2673,"The simple things in life are often the best.Trains your brain and sharpens your senses.The only way to win the game is to completely change your perspective on yourself, the world and all the objects inside by altering a few basic rules and pushing bricks."

While it may be infuriating sometimes, it truly is interesting to play each time and thinking back on it, this was my favorite game for a long time. I bought this game three times, for the switch, steam, and for a friend and each time it was a blast to play.In addition, the level designer devs are some of the smartest people in puzzles.

819,2672,"Really smart mechanics, a really novel and interesting puzzle game - not for the faint hearted!Something that surprised me was that some of the puzzles rely on weird edge case behaviour e.g. forcing movement into solid items. It means we play the game more like someone trying to hack the game by glitching it out rather than being a character in a world on a quest - maybe though that is deliberate? To make us feel like l33t speedrunners? The problem with this is that in an early level I had to look up how to solve it because I was playing 'in character'. I literally never would have solved the puzzle because I didn't expect it to rely on glitch behaviour. Now when I get stuck I'm always thinking 'is there a new glitch mechanic I don't know about?' and so I search for answers more readily. Already I've ruined a level because I searched for an answer too soon expecting a glitch and it was an 'in character' solution I just hadn't tried yet.The music gets a bit annoying and the visuals are pretty basic, especially on screens where puzzle is small but they get the job done.After all this I still would recommend because it is so awesomely interesting"

834,2672,"So far I'd say that this is a masterpiece.A game where you play by changing the mechanics of the game: who are you, what object is the goal, how objects on screen behave, ...If you know about programming, you will appreciate it even more."

843,2671,"The Puzzle Game of the DecadeThis game is brilliant in its execution, perfect in its simplicity, and is truly one of a kind. It's one of those games that will have you giggling with glee as you solve one level and then leave you feeling your brain itch as you struggle with the next. One might say that it takes the old notion of ""thinking outside the box"" to the absolute.In my opinion though, the hidden strength of this game is its universal appeal. People of all ages and backgrounds could understand, play, and appreciate this game. I've played it with my 6 year-old cousin and she loves it; sometimes she figures out the answer faster than I can. I've played with a friend over stream for game nights while we weren't able to meet in person. I'd highly recommend playing Baba is You with anyone and everyone you know, as solving these puzzles together feels all the more rewarding.Master every rule, break every rule. Your notion of what is possible will never stop expanding as you explore the wonderful world of Baba."

850,2671,"""Baba is you"" is a very fun game that looks fairly easy, but is actually pretty challenging. It provides with good brain workouts and encourages you to think outside the box.I love the game's simple style and gameplay, and how the game does not force you to finish one level before playing an other. I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys puzzle games and appreciates a good challenge."

852,2671,"The simplistic mechanics and aesthetics and the slow but intriguing pace of puzzles of Baba is You helped me two years ago when I was struggling with anxiety disorder and it was literally the only thing or activity I can do and enjoy without feeling feeling anxious, exhausted, dizzy, or having an elevated heart beat rate.thank you so much, Hempuli Oy."
853,2671,Would recommend it to people with at least 90-95 IQ otherwise you are going to be disappointed and should just stick to high action low thinking types of games.

857,2671,"Absolutely fantastic puzzler, worth picking up for the unique mechanics alone."
858,2671,Galaxy brain time.
859,2671,this game makes me feel retarded
860,2671,"Starts out super charming where you creatively use nouns/verbs/adjectives to modify the levels. But after world 2 or so the difficulty ramps up to oblivion, and the rest of the game is about using the actual words to push things in a very rigid specific orderIt's hard to explain but I don't feel the game does a good job at introducing new mechanics in isolation. A world will have new concept X in stage 1 (very easy), but then stage 2 is concept X + new hidden mechanic Y. Then you keep failing because you think you just don't fully grasp X, and get frustrated. Oh and then stage 3 is entirely an old mechanic to break the flow.In The Witness for example they make sure you understand a concept before moving on, so you're prepared when the complexity increases and mechanics are combined. In Baba I never really got an intuitive understanding of several mechanics like SINK because the solutions can be so obtuse."
861,2671,Dang this is like all the fun parts of grad school
862,2671,"Genuinely one of the most impressive games I have ever played, also one of the hardest.If you like the puzzle genre I believe you owe it to yourself to play thisIt takes a concept, and runs with it as hard as it can.There are some absolutely fantastic parts of this game, and it shockingly, may take 30+ hours for you to get to themIf you decide to drop the game before you know what I'm talking about, rather than never seeing it, I urge you to look it up instead. If you do decide to stick with the game, try not to look anything up if you can help it. That said, I think I solved about 70% of the puzzles completely on my own, 15% I had to look up a hint, and the other 15% I just had no clue on, so good luck!"
863,2671,Brain hurt
864,2671,"very fun, loved the gameno glitches i've seen so far and i can't wait for level editor (if there is on already in the game please tell me!!)the only thing i don't like is the music, it gets a tad annoying after a bitbut all in all AMAZING game highly recommend!"
865,2671,Baba is great
866,2670,"I actually played this game on a different platform, but saw it for sale here and decided to buy it.  Would definately recommend."
867,2670,"Good puzzle game, very clever, but sometimes too much. It can be hard bending your head around some of the more twisted rules, especially when they combo. I was way too dumb - or lazy - for a lot of the later levels. Still, there are enough reasonably challenging levels in the game to satisfy any gamer that doesn't have PhD in puzzlogy."
868,2670,i played on switch and this game is awesome but can we please get easy access to level editor?
869,2670,"you is me, love is baba."

871,2670,"Cute, clever puzzle game based around breaking all of the rules."
872,2670,"Very cute, very fun, a really good chill game to play in the background that doesn't demand your full attention. Fair warning: It does get difficult and you may very well not finish it. But even if you don't it's still worth."

876,2670,"This is a pretty fun game. Sure, it may not be easy, but seriously what did you expect when watching the trailer? A walk in the park?Baba Is You is a cute puzzle game that allows you to interact with numerous blocks to your advantage. It starts out pretty simple until you progress in the game, and then it becomes significantly harder. It's also addicting and I feel like I ended up playing more than I felt like I would with this game. (then again, that might be due to all of the extra time i spent thinking about how to do levels further in the game).Anyways, if you like puzzle games, then this game is for you as it will test your limits. Also, 10% of the money earned from this game goes to charity, so you'll also be helping out the community by getting this game.Well, what are you waiting for? Buy this game already!"

The melody certainly helped keeping the thoughts together, creating a fabulous integration of placid atmosphere and brain-storming. However, in the end, I accept the fact that I am just an unicellular organism.  BABA IS BEST"
882,2670,"Baba Is You is a unique and fun puzzle game unlike anything else I've seen. Despite it's simple controls, the game has a lot of depth that is explored in various fun and challenging levels. Opting into the Beta also allows you to access the game's level editor, which, thanks to the game's variety of logic blocks, is powerful enough to allow users to recreate Snake and Pac-Man. I wouldn't be surprised if we saw a lot more crazy creations in the editor. Definitely give this game a try."

887,2669,poggers af
888,2669,"While Baba IS You had some great puzzles, it would often have mechanic one-offs. You would see a mechanic once and never again. Usually these mechanics weren't explained either. The NOT operator is absolutely barbaric. It has a massive list of things it will do, it doesn't follow the rules of other operators, and most of these functions arent ever explained. Non-standardized mechanics are super frustrating. Puzzle games are dependent on clear on-boarding. Baba Is You fails here often.Yes, I beat the game. I did not look up solutions online. I wish I had. Great concept. Poor execution."

I'd say listen to the soundtrack, watch a couple of videos about this game, imagine playing it and then don't buy it and move on with your lifeWhich is a shame, I really wanted to love the game"

914,2669,Really great puzzle game
915,2669,"Baba is You is one of the greatest puzzle games ever created. Possibly even the best puzzle game ever created. The whole game is played like Chuckie Egg. You push things around until you get to the win object. The major twist is that the rules of the game are presented on screen as physical objects that can be shoved around and re-arranged to twist the rules of the game.But everyone knows that! You've watched the trailer at the top of the store page. You want to know if the game is worth the money and the time. The answer to both is YES. I bought this game on the switch for full price and on steam when it was on sale.The game ramps up in difficulty tremendously after the first 2 areas of the game. People with a knack for breaking game mechanics will feel right at home, as the solution/s to a level nearly always involve ""breaking the game"", so to speak. Like, making a rock spawn keys when pushed that spawn jellyfish when moved into the leaves that you can control that also melt ice into doors that kill jellyfish so that you can then grab a key you made earlier to open the door that the ice melted into so that you can reach the flag and win the level.If this idea interests you then buy this game, simple as that."

929,2668,"This game makes my brain hurt, it's hard as f*ck and a very challenging puzzle game BUT it's one of the BEST puzzle games I've ever played. If you let the anger overcome yourself because a puzzle is impossible and look at the answer on a 30 second youtube video, you kill the WHOLE purpose of the game (I looked for an answer once because I'm a big dumb dumb but I did it just ONCE!)Believe me, I was tempted once again to look at the answer for another puzzle because in my head it seemed impossible and ridiculous and I told myself it's probably just some bullsh*t that doesn't even make sense... NO, this game doesn't f*ck around and it hasn't any bullsh*t, EVERYTHING is planned out so you can overcome every puzzle without breaking the core rules of it, AND LET ME TELL YOU, once I calmed down, thought outside the box and tried another approach, I solved THAT MOTHER F*CKING PUZZLE, the eureka moment hit me and it felt good, IT FELT GREAT, the dopamine of me solving that puzzle hit my brain faster  than diarrhea on a saturday. It's those moments when you go oh I know what to do, and the solution to the puzzles that makes this a great game, and it keeps blowing you away with the amount of different puzzles and solutions it gives you, it makes you feel like a big brain boy.TLDR - The game is hard and challenging, but solving the puzzles feels incredibly rewarding, just don't look up the answers on youtube, you just ruin the game for yourself"
930,2668,One of those puzzle games with jaw-dropping laugh-out-loud-in-wonder moments of discovery. The game really just gets better and better the further through it you get.
931,2668,"This game is so good, you can show your friends how big brain you are! (:"
932,2668,It's sick
933,2668,Brain melting.
934,2668,"I find myself going back to this game over and over because the brilliant puzzle design never gets tiring.  Specifically, when I change the rules of the puzzle to change the win condition or transform Baba into another object, the surprise and delight is immeasurable.  Later on, when the puzzles become much more difficult, my mental limitations turn the levels into painful cases of using trial-and-error, often to no avail and can be frustrating.  However, this is still not enough to deter me.  This speaks to the consistent high quality and ability of this game to constantly remain interesting."

944,2667,Very unique concept and very enjoyable. Only downside is that it's very challenging.
945,2667,"a very unique, interesting, and great concept for a puzzle game"
946,2667,Most excellent.Genius.Highest of recommendations!
947,2667,game is good
948,2667,"This is one of the most frustrating, agonizing games I've ever played. It's extremely difficult to articulate what I like about. But, I'm giving it a thumbs-up, so I have to try my best.At its core, Baba Is You is just a block-pusher puzzle game. But of course, the twist is all in the word-based rules thing. The trailers explain better than I could, and they left me with only one question: ""Is this as good as it looks, or is it a cool concept they do nothing with?"" After over a dozen hours, I think I can safely say it is as good as it looks.The sheer amount of things you can do is staggering to behold. Nothing will ever amuse me quite the same as filling the whole screen with Babas, or becoming the walls, or becoming powerful enough to eat lava. I highly recommend playing around with any level that lets you do so; solving puzzles is fun, but messing around is even moreso.My only complaint with Baba Is You is that it's a little cruel at times. New concepts are introduced at breakneck pace, which can make it feel like a game that's way too big-brain for the average player. A few intermediary levels, to help ease the player into the trickier bits, would've been nice.I'd advise playing Baba Is You with some friends, so you can all be frustrated together. Solving puzzles on my own feels like an impossible feat, but it all just gets so much easier when there's someone else to bounce ideas off of.Either way, Baba Is You is highly recommended for anyone with the patience to suffer through the frustration. If anything in the trailers looks at all interesting to you, Baba Is You is well worth your time.EDIT: Playing just a little further, I'm finding a lot of levels that rely on understanding game mechanics that can't reasonably be understood without outside assistance. This game really needs a better tutorial, or better paced puzzles. I still think it's worth playing, for the parts that are really good. But I take no shame looking up the answers to some of these later puzzles, and I advise you to feel no shame either."
949,2667,Brain is hurt
950,2667,"Admittedly, I haven't finished the game. I got stuck and have been too stubborn to look up hints. But based on what I've played so far, I highly recommend this game. It's fairly simple and hinges on rearranging words to literally change the rules and behavior of the game. ""Baba Is You"" means that you control the Baba character, but if you, say, change the words so that ""Flag Is You,"" you instead control the flag. You can also accidentally make yourself cease to exist as a player, thereby instantly losing, so word rearrangements have to be done carefully.I love it when I try and retry a level several times only for something to suddenly click in my brain - it's so much fun to discover the trick that will let you beat a particularly annoying level. You really have to think outside the box at times. This is different from a lot of the games I play, in that it has no real story to it, but the puzzles are so intriguing that I don't really care."

956,2667,"Baba is You is for sure one of the best puzzle games out there (top 3 for me). If you like puzzle games, you will like Baba is You. It takes an unique concept and executes it insanely well. The level of creativity in Baba is You is insane, and most of the 200+ levels in the game are good. There are a lot moments in the game where youre mind will be blown.This game also has a level editor which can provide you with endless content. As of the time Im writing this review, the editor is still in Beta yet is already fairly good.Do note that Baba is You is a very hard puzzle game that most struggle on. I especially recommend you to experience Baba is You spoiler-free, you will 100% regret it if you dont."

969,2667,I'm too stupid for this and so are you.(PS: I don't like puzzle games and found out the hard way)
970,2667,"If you get depressed and feel bad when you stuck on something for a while this game is not for you (thanks to dev for more suicidal thoughts).After tutorial + couple levels this game has absurd difficulty curve where you have to think on many stuff at once including how some rules (word stacking) will/will not work in certain cituation and even worst part - making you to figure out game mechanics that are not in tutorial.I wish this game had proper tutorial instead of garbage like ""words make rules that's it now go get 100% champ"""
971,2667,"Its a very clever and unique game, but one slightly let down by a lack of guidance for the player when new gameplay concepts are introduced. Difficult puzzles and a general lack of hand-holding are fine, but a puzzle game needs to ensure it gives the player a fighting chance to succeed. Its also guilty of blatantly refusing certain solutions, akin to invisible barriers in 3D worlds which limit the player to operating within the boundaries set by the developer. It feels a bit cheap at times.Still, theres no denying the immense satisfaction awaiting players who manage to complete the later puzzles. The sense of accomplishment is at times reminiscent of defeating a boss in Dark Souls, so for patient players who are willing to persevere, theres a lot to get out of this game. Highly recommended despite its minor flaws."

It was an especially nice touch to experience how they ended the game (such a great surprise). If you like to be challenged and think outside the box, I can't recommend this game enough. Play it now!"
978,2666,The best 2D puzzle game ever made. Plenty of content and each level forces you to really think outside the box. Difficulty is quite high on a lot of puzzles. Highly recommended for any hard core puzzle fan.

980,2666,"A phenomenal puzzle game. Anyone who enjoys challenges, whether conventional puzzles or difficult games, should give Baba a shot; I've never thought of myself as a puzzle game person but this one has absorbed me for 100 hours!Baba is You is astoundingly creative and throws boundless surprises at you. Even the simplest levels can make you feel like a genius when completed.The only thing you need for Baba is You is persistence. Even if you don't consider yourself particularly clever, all you need to do is keep trying! By the end you'll feel like you're owed a PhD.I give Baba is You a 11/10.

1009,2666,"Greatest puzzle game I have ever played. It teaches you everything you need to know through neat puzzles, then throws you into the more difficult stuff, constantly expanding upon what it is secretly teaching you. Definitely worth buying if you either like puzzle games or if you want to give them a try. Tons of content as well, the limits of which has become basically infinite due to the editor (which is amazing as well, even if it's currently in beta). 10 outta 10"
1010,2666,baba is you
1011,2665,The smartest game I have ever played
1012,2665,Great
1013,2665,Hours of frustrating fun!
1014,2665,game make brain hurtgame is goodplay game
1015,2665,"Playing this game makes me feel like a neanderthal discovering fire for the first time.Except I don't discover it; I just sit in the dark smacking twigs together and grunting for literal hours before realizing I'm already holding a lighter in my hand and finishing the level.Highly recommend, amazing game."
1016,2665,baba is me
1017,2665,My brain is melted...
1018,2665,"Fantastic puzzle designs, they can really make you think outside the box.Don't go into this game expecting to 100% quickly, this is the kind of game you sometimes have to take breaks from and then come back later, and then you'll have an easier time solving puzzles you had trouble with before. Though it will never get easier to do so.I approve of this puzzle game."
1019,2665,"This is a great game. Not recommended for players like me 'the not so smart kind'. Defs recommended to all those who want to test their patience and intelligence. I didn't have to play long to know the limits of mine. LOL. Great thing is, you get spoiler free guides that really help too (again, unless you are like me); in which case you should go for the walk through tips to avoid the embarrassment of not getting through level 11.  Still, a great game."
1020,2665,game is good
1021,2665,My head aches
1022,2665,"Some of the best puzzles I've ever seen. And as my playtime might suggest, it will be well worth the price - it's amazing how much was done with simple graphics and a limited game engine. It really makes you think outside the box and be stumped on a puzzle for hours on end, not to mention it has more than 200 puzzles.If you feel too stumped, however, check the helpful BABA IS HINT, an unofficial guide that only contains hints, and not solutions or spoilers.You'll want to 100% this masterpiece!"
1023,2665,Why is this so hard?
1024,2665,"Probably one of the hardest puzzle games I've ever played, for me at least. Definitely have been times I've spent an hour looking at the screen making no progress. But usually the solutions are delightfully simple and I feel suddenly dense for not seeing it.The art/aesthetic is great. Great to stretch the brain every now and then with a heavy puzzle, though it can be frustrating if you expect immediate progress."
1025,2665,OMFG IT HURTSSSSSSS
1026,2665,YES YES YES YES YESSS!!!
1027,2665,"Amazing game, hope more people play and finish it fully."
1028,2665,"Inventive and fun, challenging but not too hard.  Sparks 'a-ha' moments that are satisfying and sometimes hilarious.  Get it and you wont regret it."
1029,2665,It's hard
1030,2665,"I cannot remember the last time I played a puzzle game that tempted me to look up hints this much. The puzzles were hard, the hidden puzzles were harder, the puzzle within the hidden puzzle that led to another puzzle which was a puzzle in and of itself was an amazing experience. If you enjoy solving puzzles, this is for you. As always with puzzle games, I only have one piece of advice: no matter how tempted you may be, no matter how impossible you may think a level is, do NOT look up any hints. Believe me, I have solved every puzzle in this game (if you don't believe me, look at my achievements, I've done it). If you think a puzzle is tough, leave it and come back to it. Think about the rules, what do they mean? Think outside the box, think inside the box, flip the box inside out and think outside of THAT, and you'll come to the solution!"
1031,2665,Very inventive puzzles. Good progression of difficulty. Many puzzles have a variety of creative solutions
1032,2665,BABA is good.
1033,2665,"BABA IS YOU is, by far, the best puzzle game of 2019. In its nature - a meta-game,  he challenge is to change the rules of the game as you play is.In its essence - a hacking game, ask yourself: ""what hidden assumption holds me back?""In its aesthetics -a minimalistic game: no chores, no complex nor long solutions. All is neat.In its spirit - a poetic game, thin ideas communicated via intricate game mechanics and clever level names.Since Braid I did not enjoy that much and that deeply from a computer game. BABA IS GREAT"
1034,2665,
1035,2665,"Awesome, that's it.Start with good premise, the developer decided being decent is not good enough. He decided to go all out. All the hard puzzles are really difficult, forcing you to think outside the box. Then there are a lot of mechanics which make you think, ""wow, really, they add this?"". there are also a lot of meta contents."
1036,2665,gud game
1037,2665,Baba is great.
1038,2665,"One of the best games out there. If you love puzzle solving and finding clever solutions to varied and interesting challenges, then this is the game for you."
1039,2665,yeee yeee yeee
1040,2665,Good puzzle!
1041,2665,Very fun and challenging puzzle game.
1042,2665,"Baba is LIFE.The puzzles are so damn good! Get this game if you enjoy kicking yourself for hours until you finally ""get"" it then you get to repeat the whole thing over again :)"

All thats left to say is: GAME is LOVE.)"
1052,2664,"Definitely would recommend this game to those who like challenging puzzle games. Just remember that this game becomes really, really hard later on."
1053,2664,good
1054,2664,This game is a fire thinking game!
1055,2664,"Rating - 9/10Overview  A unique, deceptively challenging puzzle game with quirky visuals and smooth mechanics and game-play.Issues  I experienced zero issues when playing.Recommendation  Yes, if you enjoy challenging but fair puzzles this could be a game for you."

1059,2664,"one of my favorite puzzle games, beautifully wraps hard abstract logic puzzles into an intuitive and approachable package.boasts vast amounts of content with a gentle learning curve from basic to obtuse.play as much or as little as you like."

1063,2664,Top notch puzzle game with great originality - one of my favourites
1064,2664,Very creative puzzle game.
1065,2664,"Really, really great game - gotta be one of my favorites of all time. After many hours of staring and thinking, I've finally beaten the whole game (to my knowledge) and almost every single level (and there are a lot!) had a very satisfying ""aha"" moment that made the game really enjoyable. Cute graphics and nice music too. I wouldn't think of this game as a programming game or an open-ended game like scribblenauts; each level is about discovering a new application of the game's mechanics. By the time I reached the end of the game, I felt super accomplished and excited to see what else I could do despite the continually increasing difficulty of the game. I'm honestly kind of sad it's over, but I'm really looking forward to the custom levels and level sharing feature currently in development."
1066,2664,difficult but enjoyable!
1067,2664,Baba Is Pain And Suffering
1068,2664,I am bad at puzzle games period.
1069,2664,Very fun and playful puzzle game. It can be frustrating sometimes with some huge difficulty spikes but the solutions are generally pretty satisfying. Quick tip: you can enable a grid overlay in the settings and while this makes the game less graphically appealing it can really help with certain puzzle where you have to line objects up very precisely. Highly recommend this game.
1070,2664,"Great game, with very smart puzzles. However, there are too many level for me to finish the game. I strongly recommend it if you are into puzzle games."

1083,2663,funny sheep
1084,2663,"I really wish the developer add a hint. Some of the levels are way beyond understandable. I stuck in one level for five days, and finally gave up and look up solution. The solution was confusing for me but I beat the level anyway. I felt so dirty so I had to write a review about it."
1085,2663,Its so good but Im so stupid

1087,2663,
1088,2663,it is a really fun game:) worth the money
1089,2663,HARD but very satisfying and creative puzzle game! I had a great time despite some frustration and looking up a hint or two a few times. Highly recommend!
1090,2663,My brain hurts in a good way. =^_^=
1091,2663,"Its a good game overall.  Fun game with a silly, cute, and lovable sense of humour.  Also a good game to play when you want something that doesn't take alot of time play."
1092,2663,"this game is very difficult, but a lot of fun and very interesting, everytime you figure out the solution, it is so satisfying, sure its difficult, but you always got to think out of the box, and seeing how it works is so cool, amazing game"
1093,2663,"A wonderful puzzle game that uniquely combines block pushing and programming. Very challenging in later levels, as the game makes puzzles out of many different ""rules"" that overlap and get complex fast. Every puzzle feels incredibly rewarding to solve though, and there's a even level editor in the works!Highly recommended ^^"
1094,2663,"This game is extraordinarily good. It is a puzzle game that has a lot of interesting mechanics.It feels like programming because you build rules that the game follows. Often times its comical how literally the rules are followed.Highly recommend buying this. I got it on discount but after playing it I think its well worth the full price. I hope this game gets awards.Also, please devs consider making a mobile version. Would love to play this on mobile."
1095,2663,"it's pretty fun. however, your brain will  die while playing this so be careful =D"
1096,2663,Hardest game i have ever played

1098,2663,Im too dumb to finish the main game so im just playing the custom levels
1099,2663,"baba is you is a game about a person named baba who you play as. Baba pushed around the words and can change the rules. Baba is stones? maybe a book or a cup of coffe, literally endless babas await you."

1101,2663,brain is hurt
1102,2663,its a neat game!
1103,2663,"I've never seen a puzzle game like this before. It almost feels like a crash course in programming logic. To advance requires utilizing and changing the rules in the proper order. The puzzles are clever, the graphics are charming. I highly recommend this game."
1104,2663,big brain game
1105,2663,"Very clever game, I like"
1106,2663,Hyv
1107,2663,This game is designed really well and asks players to think outside of the box/flex different muscles. Love it.
1108,2663,"This is one of the most satisfying games I've played. If you like thinking outside the box, give it a try!"
1109,2663,lol
1110,2663,"One of the best, mind-bending puzzlers of the decade. A must for anyone that loves to play puzzle games."

1121,2663,So very good even if I have so little patience. 100% would keep playing just to push the robot around. Baba is cute. Game is play.

1137,2663,its so hard i don't wanna play anymore and cheat through every level. the developer is truly an evil genius
1138,2663,A nice chill puzzle game that makes you feel more dumb
1139,2663,I really like how difficult this game can be! :)
1140,2663,Solid puzzle gameplay -- every puzzle has surprised me thus far! Reminiscent of Braid in how it delights!
1141,2663,Yes.
1142,2662,Baba Is You is an amazing puzzle game. It is so much more than how it appears on the surface. Some puzzles are so challenging you'll feel like an absolute genius when you finally solve a puzzle that took you hours of retries to finally figure out. If you like puzzle games you should give this one a try.
1143,2662,"Yea, I guess I have to say it's a good game. It does a good job of easing you into the puzzle mechanics, and has a fairly steady ramp in difficulty. Moreover, It's a very aesthetically pleasing game, the environments are really quite pretty, and the music is actually fantastic. The level editor is also quite fun, it definitely helped me to understand how the game mechanics properly worked.overall, 9/10 good game, very slightly overpriced but whatever"
1144,2662,Great mechanics and a lovely art style
1145,2662,"Superb puzzle game. Puzzle games are not my forte, so I expected to be excruciatingly bad at this. Thankfully though Baba is You builds you up slowly, teaching you the basics and then giving you some challenge. I never felt the game was telling me I was dumb, instead I felt smart whenever I completed levels. Baba is You is exceptional at the ahah moments of puzzle games. I can't count the times I went ""Oooh"" when completing a level. 10/10 exceptional value for an amazing game, I can't recommend enough."
1146,2662,"Hands down one of the best puzzle games I've come across.The only thing that is somewhat bothering, is a missing hint feature. If you really get stuck, there won't be any help except complete solution videos on youtube, which takes a lot of the fun. There should be a way to trade the dandelions, that you earn through completing a puzzle, for hints."
1147,2662,BABA IS WIN
1148,2662,Baba is YES
1149,2662,Definitely one of the hardest and most challenging single player video games I have ever encountered. This game is an algorithmic challenge which highly involves you to think out of the box at all times. Even if You are not confident in this types of games I recommend to try the game and slowly proceed through the levels as it is definitely greatly satisfying to complete each level.
1150,2662,"Extremely inventive and charming little game!The more difficult levels will absolutely mess with your head though, fair warning."
1151,2662,"Such a masterpiece, and the level editor only makes it better."
1152,2662,
1153,2662,"Might just be the most challenging puzzle game I've played. And also one of the most fun! That's because it brings you slowly through the game, bit by bit. The puzzle concept in this game encourages extreme potential, and I have a desire to 100% this game, which I don't get with a lot of puzzle games."
1154,2662,Great puzzle game

1156,2662,"awesome base game (with big twist), awesome user-created content, very intuitive level editor, money is done"
1157,2662,"My favorite puzzle game, it never makes me stuck for too long, and is really fun, great job on this game"
1158,2662,This game is an absolute joy in it's simplicity. It's challenging and engaging. I especially enjoy getting together with friends and trying to solve the puzzles together. It's very relaxing and easy to pick up. Definitely one of the best puzzle games I've played in a while

1171,2662,"The puzzling is very interesting, As a programmer, it is right up my street. I'd recommend it for anyone who enjoys rule based puzzles."
1172,2662,"Quality brain teaser. The game is a ""sokoban"" type of puzzle game where you are given a set of rules, but you can pick apart the rules and make your own. The goal of the game is to manipulate rules in a way tha enables you getting to ""win"" object or you are the winning object. It starts off easy to give you a small taste of what you can expect, then blows your mind when you think you are close to finishing the game (For spoiler reasons, I can't further explaning what I mean. You are just going to have to trust me). 10/10  Will give you a headache"
1173,2662,good
1174,2662,"This game has amazing puzzles. Sound design is exceptional, and pops up in my head more than a year after playing it. The vibe of this game is strong and wonderful"
1175,2662,"This is one of the most creative puzzle games I've ever played. Puzzles are basically equal parts frustrating and satisfying. The logic system in the game is mostly intuitive but the combinations make it impressively broad in application.My main criticism (other than that the designer is clearly much smarter than I am :P ) is that some of the solutions in later puzzles feel frustratingly narrow. Early puzzles give you multiple solutions, or at least fairly clear solutions, whereas a lot of the later puzzles have very specific, sometimes convoluted methods where any alternative solutions are blocked off by extra rules.That said, this game is well worth the price and I think anyone who likes block puzzle games should give it a shot."
1176,2662,"I'm not sure what happened, but I started this game at 11PM, played for an hour, and then it was 4AM so I went to sleep and started dreaming about solutions to the level I was stuck onI think this is one of those mind virus games from, like, Star Trek or something. But it's probably still worth playing even if it does end up destroying civilization by taking over our brains - these puzzles are really goodIf you're the sort of person who likes puzzle games, I'm sure you'll enjoy this. Just expect some confusion and frustration as you figure out the nuance of the mechanics.I also have to compliment the music and art. Both are simple, but extremely enjoyable. The track ""Cog is Push"" in particular is wonderfully dreamlike, surreal, and beautiful."

1214,2662,Enlightening.
1215,2662,"Baba is You does a good job at making the player aware of whether what they tried was the right idea. It's immediately obvious what effects the rules have on the game world, and this makes it fun to try different things if you don't see a solution right off the bat.Game also does a great job at making full use of its mechanics. There's a ton of surprising interactions in the game and it's fun to watch things click together."
1216,2662,Baba Is You. Baba has fun playing Baba Is You. Baba recommends Baba Is You greatly. You Is Baba.
1217,2662,"Hard af, but its equally if not more rewarding every time you complete a level, and the oh so wonderful ""congratiolations!"" text pops up"
1218,2662,nothing short of a torture chamber
1219,2662,"Possibly the greatest puzzle game ever! A sokoban-style puzzle game where text commands in the form of pushable blocks make up the rules! The sheer number of different commands available results in a nigh-infinite variety of puzzles. Truly a brilliant concept that is even more brilliantly executed! Unlike most sokoban-style games, the real challenge comes from forming the right rules and using them to your advantage, rather than maneuvering through tight spaces. While the aspect of working through spaces is still there, it is not that difficult on its own, though when combined with the aspect of rule-bending, it can really drive you insane! It should be noted that some of the text blocks are sealed away in impenetrable walls, so there are some rules that cannot be changed for each level!I dare say that this is one of the most unique games ever! Plenty of levels to keep you occupied for a while, too! Yes, it is brutally challenging, but it's difficult in the way that you really have to think outside the box in order to solve the puzzles, rather than requiring a ungodly number of steps. Really makes you feel like a genius whenever you solve a puzzle! Worth every penny!I should also mention that there is a level editor, which means there are plenty of community-made custom levels available out there for you to try if you somehow manage to complete all 200+ levels of the base game! The fun never ends!Update 1 (10 Aug 2021): I think it's worth mentioning that I have yet to complete the game, though I have sort of 'beaten' it. I'm around 70% through right now, and I definitely plan to finish it one day, but the puzzles have gotten so fiendishly difficult that my progress is pretty much stagnant right now. I still attempt a few levels time to time, and occasionally even make a breakthrough, like I just did today, but I doubt I'd be able to finish it this year. I could always use walkthroughs or hints if I wanted to, but I'm against looking up solutions for puzzle games, and I highly suggest everyone not to do so as you'd just be cheating yourself out of experiencing the 'Eureka' moment of having solved a difficult puzzle on your own! Take a break from the game when you find yourself stuck. Sometimes a fresh mindset is all your need to come up with a solution!"

1235,2662,Very good for someone who likes constantly changing presuppositions about the world around in the game.
1236,2662,Simple yet incredibly complex. Very well-done puzzle game. Includes some pretty silly things you can accidentally do to yourself.
1237,2662,its very hard. I barely beat the first 10 levels and the sunken water levels are very hard. buy it but youll need to google how to beat some levels

1242,2661,One of the most fun and interesting puzzle game I've played in a while. It can get very challenging but the game does a good job at training you throughout the first levels when a new concept is introduced.

1246,2661,
1247,2661,One of the best puzzle games Ive ever played. A combination of programming puzzle games like (such as TIS-100 from Zachtronics) and a sokobon puzzle game (push-box-into-target-location genre) that is completely unique. I havent even finished some of the hardest puzzles at the very end of the game. So good I bought it on Switch as well and gift it to friends. Buy it if you like challenging puzzle games.
1248,2661,BABA IS GOOD
1249,2661,Game is Good
1250,2661,Amazing.Also incredibly hard.
1251,2661,"(Review far prior to finishing the game!)What is ""Baba Is You""?""Baba Is You"" is the most innovative game of 2019. Behind the facade of DOS-era graphics waits a cleverly designed puzzle game that has only a few fixed rules, while all others can be changed by the player. Moving the playable character(s) on a grid, the player can interact with objects, including the text that gives the rules for a level.One of the rules - that obviously can be changed - is the tile of the game: Baba Is You. Seemingly impossible puzzles can be solved by doing stuff that is outright hilarious but always extremely clever. You are Baba, but you don't have to be. Sort the text correctly: Wall is You. Yes, now you control all walls - but not Baba anymore.Flag is Win. But you can't reach the flag? Just set any other object to win. Even the one you control.The only limitations come from the level design, the dev there really made great puzzles, but in a few cases unnecessarily annoying or complicated. However, most of the time the experience is very enjoyable. Sadly, I can only write a pre-review, as I did not get far through the game. With only ten hours in, I did solve a few worlds.Apropos solving: The game never is unfair. You can undo moves or restart the level at any point. When there is an unintended solution, the dev usually patches it out - except in early levels where you learn the game and might find solutions that are more complicated than the one that was intended.The level editor by now has entered the open beta, and apparently now everyone can create own levels. So there is even more content after the game is finished. Will it reach the quality of the official levels? Well, there were dedicated players who used the dev's level editor before it went to open beta, it was undocumented available. So level sets exist already that are by dedicated people and that hold themselves to high standards. So the game never truly is completed for a player.The game is controlled entirely by keyboard or controller, and thanks to the undo function mistakes aren't an issue.The music and sound are fitting.In an era where many games build on well-established ideas, ""Baba Is You"" manages to create something innovative, something that at least I had never seen before. Giving the player near total control of the level leads to incredible results, but all the while that control might not bring him closer to the simple target - get the player and the victory condition together.Baba Is You? Lover is me!Recommended: Yes, for everyone who loves clever puzzles"
1252,2661,GAME IS PLAYGAME IS HARD AND GOODGAME IS DONEGAME IS GOODBABA LIKE GAME
1253,2661,"The amount of thought put into level crafting is great! Some levels made me worry that my badly crafted rules would've crashed the game, though......EDIT: Yep, I crashed it. But don't worry, recent beta builds catches most of the crashing glitches."
1254,2661,i am too stupid for this game and i regret buying game that i cant play because my low intelligence

Fun game mechanic that's unique to other puzzle games, but not too hard to understand! I don't know what else to say other than it's super enjoyable and just the right amount of challenging!"
1260,2661,Intriguing game. Why does it have TempleOS graphics tho? I can't stand the damn graphics! It's horrible!

1269,2661,baba is fun
1270,2661,"The level editor is amazing, because Baba is You is actually Turing Complete, which means you can create entire games in baba is you! this is very fun in my opinion, and i actually haven't experienced the main game puzzles (kinda spoiled since i watched an entire playthrough before even buying the game), but even so it's still very fun - i don't think it's really worth the price for just the editor and custom levels (which are still fun though, maybe on sale), however again, i didn't get to experience all the official levels correctly, so i can't really judge if they're worth the money."
1271,2661,Me is smart after playing funny sheep game :)
1272,2661,this game is very good fundamentally but the difficulty curve in the later levels gets far greater than anticipated in a game with this 'cute' style. definitely one of if not the most original and challenging puzzle games ive played in recent years but towards the end itseemed most levels had either so much going on its hard to keep track of or so little going on its like a riddle  i found myself more often than not in search of hints if not solutions and didnt entirely feel right pressing on to the end without actually playing the game myself. maybe one day ill return and my brain will be ready
1273,2661,BABA is BESTME is ANGRY
1274,2661,Some of the most innovative and interesting puzzle solving I have ever played. I would absolutely love to know how the creators came up with such a unique design for gameplay.
1275,2661,"This puzzle game really makes you want to cheat sometimes, especially when you spend an hour or more one just one puzzle, though I don't think I have cheated (yet).The game reminds me of programming in that you assign variables with other variables or actions, such as Baba is defeat or Baba is you.  But even beyond that you will end up pushing the text itself to move or destroy other objects in the game, such as pushing text into water to remove it and allow you to cross safely.  It may not look like much but this is possibly the best and maybe hardest puzzle game I have played, and I also personally love the music as it is very chill."
1276,2661,Challenging and a lot of fun.
1277,2661,"A masterpiece puzzle game. Nearly all of the chapters have more than 1 solution, It's very enjoying to only move the blocks in order to complete the chapter. One of the most innovative,unique game."

1282,2661,"Baba Is You is a very fun puzzle game, and is very hard to complete. I have not completed the game yet, but i have 100% completed two areas. The different endings also help players know more rules about the game. I recommend this game for people who like challenging puzzle games, and who like the game Sokoban, which is in the same genre as this game.

1293,2661,"It's a fun little puzzle game, very relaxing. Would recommend. Saw a streamer playing it to chill/chat and decided to pick it up, was worth it."

Dose that make me a retarded or just slow?I would recommend buying if you like to go to bed podering on how to solve this level or if its not worth it"
1299,2661,The most challenging puzzler I have played. Super fun to dive into until you start hitting the first walls. One day I will return and try tearing them down again!
1300,2661,GAME IS GOOD AND HARDI IS IDIOTGAME HAS I
1301,2661,"Most of the negative reviews on this game have two main points:1) It's too hard, or better worded, the difficulty curve has a huge wall pretty early on2) There's only one intended solution, so it's not really thinking outside the box, more of thinking inside the developer's box.I'm going to try and explain my views on these matters.First off, the difficulty curve. There are certainly some very hard levels even in the first few worlds. In my opinion, though, that's on purpose - as you play the game more and become more accustomed to the way of thinking it requires, those levels start to get easier. You can always get the required amount of levels to ""beat"" the world without completing those really hard ones, so I'd argue that they're designed to be something akin to those really hard enemies in the early areas of Dark Souls - if you manage to beat them then congrats, go on ahead, but it would be wise to try again when you're a bit better at the game.The second one is a bit harder to talk about without using graphical aid. But to put it simply, I don't believe the people who are using the ""outside the box"" description really know what that means in terms of the average puzzle game.Most people, when they think of ""thinking outside the box"", they think of something like the Hitman games - you can do just about anything to accomplish your goal, no matter how absurd it is. Of course it has a limit, no video game could accurately account for and program in the truly insane ideas humanity has, but for the most part a lot of the things you try will work as long as you have the skill to pull it off.If you applied that to Baba Is You, where whatever you try would probably work, it would be a very, very boring game. Most puzzle games have to limit themselves to one solution - that's usually where the challenge comes in. You need to find a solution by trying things, and thinking about what happened when you tried what you did, and devising a new plan with what you've now learned. BIY is less about the execution of the level, and more about the concept of the level. There's almost always one solution. But I never have felt like I was truly stumped - I've always had more ideas on how to go about the level.BIY is a hard game. It's challenging, it makes you think a lot. I like that in a game. If you don't, I'd say save your money. But in my opinion this is the best puzzle game ever made."

1342,2660,"Best, most innovative puzzle game in the last few years. Pick it up and test your IQ!"
1343,2660,Excellent game well worth the money
1344,2660,"The concept is just so extremely clever -- changing the rules to achieve a goal rather than achieving a goal within the rules. The puzzles are very well done; they're challenging, yet rewarding, and they really require a unique type of thinking, different than any other puzzle games I've played before.I will admit though -- I didn't finish this game. As with a few friends and me, we all got stuck at various points and eventually stopped playing; there just was no point reading up the solutions online. Of course, some mini in-game hints would have helped us a lot. In the end, it's good that we got stuck; it demonstrates that the skill ceiling is high (way above our skill) and that it can challenge even the best puzzle solvers or, at the very least, give them one of the most unique puzzle sets to solve."

It has an amazing concept that's executed extremely well, and now that the level editor is in beta this will probably be my most played game ever. If you want an incredible puzzle game, Baba Is You doesn't disappoint. 11/10, while it does take a while to learn the mechanics, once you do there are so many amazing things you can do.Also, THANK YOU for not making any online achievements."
1348,2660,I would suggest it if you're big brain enough to be able to go with the sudden difficulty jumps some levels have which made the game less fun for me at one point.

1351,2660,"Baba Is You,A difficult yet wonderful puzzle game where the rules are present in the gameBest puzzle game I have ever played"
1352,2660,An elegantly simple mechanic with countless possibilities. I haven't been this blown away by a puzzle game since Portal.
1353,2660,"I have a love hate relationship with this game. The puzzles are hard as hell and you spend hours just on one. However, I can't stop playing the game. This game is the video game adaptation of crack. If you want to feel like Megamind after solving puzzles, this game is for you."
1354,2660,brain tingle in a good way
1355,2660,"i typically burn out pretty fast with similar puzzle games when the difficulty starts to ramp up. But the mechanics in this game allow for some really surprising (and funny?) solutions - which have really helped me to power through some of the usual puzzle drudgery while my brain struggles to wake up.Super charming presentation. I don't have the stamina to marathon too many puzzles back to back, but it's been nice to open and solve a couple between other things."

1360,2660,"10/10I have many games, but this is the very first one I review.The concept it's incredibly original, easy to understand and full of potential. How come nobody ever thought about it before?Most levels require patience and creative thinking, because they have a unique kind of logic that's usually hard to figure out. Some are so brilliant it's hard to believe they were designed by human beings.Probably the hardest and most rewarding puzzle game I've ever played (harder than Portal 2)... And I've only played for 3 hours! My favorite levels so far: Island-12 & Ruins-5.Totally worth the money. Happy to promote intelligence."
1361,2660,"This game is very good and I love it! I'm definitely not smart enough for it, though"

1364,2660,A really unique puzzle game. Great fun. Some of the puzzles require knowledge of implicit behaviour that take a lot of experimentation to uncover.
1365,2660,Best puzzle game on steam.
1366,2660,Fun and somewhat addictive puzzler with unique mechanics I have not seen anywhere else. Would recommend to all gamers of all shapes and sizes.

1371,2660,Objectively the greatest game ever made. Finally usurping my #1 favorite spot from Majora's Mask after all this damn time. Modern Classic. Play it.
1372,2660,One of my all-time favourites. Logic and puzzeling at it's best. And cute minimalistic graphics.
1373,2660,GOOD
1374,2660,A puzzle masterpiece that fries your brain. It's never been so fun to feel stupid until you finally solve a level and discover that you could have done it differently. Would recommend to anyone looking for a very serious challenge and a cute bunny.
1375,2660,Great puzzle game. it's a lot of fun and quite unique.
1376,2660,"Ive been trying to solve these puzzles so long that I have no more creativity juices left in my brain, thus preventing me from writing a funny and informative review.Just buy the game dammit, its fun."

1386,2660,Deceptively simple rules. Fiendishly difficult. Worth every dollars.

1389,2660,"Amazing game; has beautiful graphics and innovative gameplay. Even though it is common to get stuck on a level, just taking a break and going back to it helps me solve the puzzles. So far, no walkthrough was needed; all it takes to beat Baba is You is creative thinking and a little bit of patience as you try to  change your view of a level to think of the solution."

1398,2660,"Baba Is You is an excellent puzzle game full of fun surprises. Although it's technically a kind of Sokoban, it isn't about claustrophobic block-pushing: instead, the puzzles focus on memorable interactions with the game's mechanics. As the game progresses, it starts to make delightful revelations about itself, challenging your perceptions about how it worked all along.The premise of ""changing the rules"" may appear at first to lend to open-ended puzzles, but this is not the case here: most of the levels are designed with a specific solution in mind. This way, every level forces you to think in a new and unique way.I do highly recommend Baba Is You to anyone who likes a good puzzle. (In my opinion, the less you know going in, the better.)"

The solutions are generally pretty short, but figuring out what the actual solutions are will take a long while. Don't be thrown off because it looks like there's block puzzles; the game isn't Sokoban or anything.There's a lot of quality content, and it also has a level editor in beta (which will give it a lot more content)."

1408,2660,"The TL;DR: BABA IS YOU is an excellent game worthy of the awards bestowed on it. What could make this purchase not a recommendation for you is that you need to change your mindset to something you're simply not wired in your head to do.Detailed Review Follows:BABA IS YOU is a hard game to describe, and that might be my failing in not continuing with this game. It's basically a puzzle game where you, an animal named BABA (a sheep?) is tasked to solve a problem presented, but you can change the rules of the universe you are in to solve it. That might seem simple to do, since that implies omnipotence, but if you don't understand what the rules are in the first place, impotency in trying to change them is more likely the outcome. You have to learn by trial and error.You are basically given just two things as the foundation to start your attempts from:* You can move horizontally and vertically but not diagonally.* You can change the rules that govern BABA's universe by moving words to form certain phrases, but you're not told the syntax. You have to guess what that is. Imagine being told you have to learn your native language not by going to school but simply fumbling about through trial and error. Guessing. Yes, you could do that but it would take considerably longer than simply being told up front the correct symbols to use in writing, and the correct phonetics to utter in speaking. BABA does not explain to you the entire syntax of the rules of the universe he (I'm assuming BABA's a he) wanders around in his attempts to solve the puzzle he's stuck in. You need to know not only the correct order to put text in, but also the valid directions to be in. Up to the point I quit in frustration, I learned the following.[NOUN] IS [PRONOUN/ADVERB][NOUN]IS[PRONOUN/ADVERB]          [NOUN][NOUN] IS [PRONOUN/ADVERB]    [PRONOUN/ADVERB]I'm sure there are other universe defining syntax and directions to use, but it's not being explained and to me, in any game, and as I stated in my review of Silicon Zeroes, it is important to be taught the game mechanics up front before playing any game. You shouldn't have to use the Monkey writing Shakespeare theorem (which states given an infinite amount of time and food, even a monkey can write a work of Shakespeare) in order to understand the rules of any game. State everything up front, then let the player go solve the puzzle. This does not make BABA IS YOU A terrible game. It has overwhelmingly positive reviews. It won awards for being a very special kind of game that bucks the trend. What makes me give it a bad review is that it asks you, rather unfairly and as a player in a forum post said to me when I had a problem with a puzzle, to let go of what you know and view the world in a completely foreign alien way. I can't work that way.  I expect the world I live in to operate in a certain way and I work within the paradigm of that structure to exist. I cannot flip it around to make it work for me, particularly where I don't even understand how that world works in the first place."
1409,2660,"Not much to say that hasn't been said in the many thousands of positive reviews so far. It's clever, fun, mind-bending, cute, and one of those games that just works universally.

1453,2658,"An undeniably brilliant feat of game design that I can't say I particularly enjoyed playing very much in retrospect. When you ponder a puzzle for 5 minutes and then finally crack the mystery, it is an extremely satisfying feeling. However, I found at later levels, some puzzles were taking me 20 or even 30+ minutes to solve, and that level of difficulty is a bit too much for me to find fun.Highly recommended for admirers of clever design, and hardcore puzzle solvers. To everyone else, try it out: if you're finding things a little too frustrating at 2 hours, I would advise that it's not going to get better as you progress further."
1454,2658,"BABA is YOU isn't just a game, it's a journey. I played most of the game with a friend of mine. We laughed, we cried, we got angry, we even tried to suicide... but in the end, it was worth it.Recommended to all the people who want to harm themselv... erm, I mean... the people who want to have a challenge and a good time. Yeah, that's what I meant! Ah ah"

1463,2658,"My favorite puzzle game ever. You push around blocks with text to change the rules of the game. It's programmatically easy to understand, yet even late game I'm finding surprising interactions between different elements. It really teaches you to question the assumptions you make - I often start out thinking a level is impossible, and then going carefully through my chain of reasoning realize which step is false. It has a programming ""feel"" to it - and it certainly has that Turing-completeness - but it's not at all like the games which are a game UI slapped on top of a simple programming language. And it is so META.It really brought me back to the days when I did math contests, when I would keep thinking about problems away from the desk and suddenly have an ""aha!"" moment. It takes a really good puzzle game to be intuitive and difficult enough so that you can keep thinking about it as you go about your day and possibly suddenly solve it in the shower."
1464,2658,This is a pretty hard puzzle game. It goes really hard on the difficulty of trying to figure out how to approach them.
1465,2658,"Its fun, but i suck too much at it to beat it"
1466,2658,"An insanely creative and satisfying puzzle game in my experience. The progression of difficulty generally feels good and as things start to get challenging, it feels gratifying to figure out that tough solve.However, I can't honestly recommend playing it until completion unless you start consulting a walkthrough for the last areas. A lot of the puzzles started feeling absurdly difficult and abstract. Maybe other people are better at this game than me. Maybe I was starting to get a little burnt out on playing time (this is a very long game). But it was just too frustrating for me at the end without a walkthrough for some of those levels. Honestly I don't even feel like the walkthrough took away from the experience of the completion of this game. It was still interesting to see all the crazy level designs and ideas!The bottom line is definitely pick the game up and try it out if it looks appealing. You'll enjoy it. But don't be afraid to look up a walkthrough for the hardest parts of the game, or simply ignore those levels; that'll save you some time and frustration"

1474,2657,A fun exercise in thinking outside the box.
1475,2657,"I write software for a living and playing this game feels like debugging. I'm sometimes, but rarely, in the mood for a game like this."
1476,2657,"A really fun puzzler with a unique system. I love changing game rules mid game. This must've been hard to make puzzles for, but its seriously fun."
1477,2657,"[GAME] is [AMAZING] but [HARD]. [YOU] should consider buying [GAME], if [YOU] is skillful enough."
1478,2657,It's very rare for a game to force you to change your perspective so many times.Extremely satisfying and challenging.
1479,2657,"Wonderful, existential and cheeky. The puzzle mechanic forces the out-of-the-box finale puzzle solutions out of the player... and things keep getting more difficult. 1/3 logic puzzle, 1/3 exilstential mechanics and brilliant level design, and 1/3 well-produced trollfest.Makes me want Noita."
1480,2657,"What an exhilarating experience does this game provide. Changing the known rules of the universe just to find the right solution. Levels can be beaten in many different forms. Some levels require only one solution, while others can require multiple. Throughout playing I have discovered mechanics I never thought possible, and I usually find them when I try to guess for a solution I haven't tried before. Some levels have taken me days to figure out, while others only a few hours. It's a creative indie puzzle game that thinks outside the box, and if you're new to this game, you're in for a lot."

1483,2657,"Definitely among the best meta games everyone should try!The innovative design that you ""change game rules"" while playing it opens up a whole lot of new ideas. And what's more, the maps themselves are levels. Hundreds of hours of brain-teasing puzzles for some $10? Must BUY!I also recommend The Witness and Pony Island to whoever find this interesting and want to check out more similar games."

1486,2657,"It's very charming, and sometimes the solutions are fun in ways that make you smile. There's a ton of flexibility and creativity in simply getting a win condition in a way that sets this game apart from many other puzzle games. The soundtrack is fantastic, too, which helps when you're stuck. I imagine it gets harder, but so far the challenges don't make me frustrated with the game--they make me think that it's my fault I can't find a solution, and not a fault of the game design. That's huge for a puzzle game in my book."
1487,2657,Awesome puzzle game.
1488,2657,If you like difficult puzzles then this game is for you. Excellent game.

1490,2657,BABA IS YOU   IS WIN
1491,2657,"There's a few things I want to say about this game, because a lot of the other reviews are nonsensical garbage that only makes sense if you've played the game. The game is fantastic. At full price you won't regret this one. It's a turn-based puzzler, and I don't like turn based anything for the most part. It even has an undo button and a restart button. But that description undersells it because this is by no means your average standard game.It's very cute and the other reviews are basically correct in that the way the game is set up is funny and not just ""for da memes"", which the other reviews make it look like. I don't like memes at all but I get where they are coming from, and they are right. The thing is, the puzzles are very intelligent and train you to think differently for different puzzles. They don't always order in terms of difficulty, but that ends up being fine, because once you solve a difficult puzzle, if the next 3 puzzles are relatively easy, it's a breath of fresh air you'll find that you'll need. The puzzles become unforgivingly difficult.Once you play this, you will understand as well, and you will love the game for the way it presents itself and plays."
1492,2657,it took me 2 years...yeah pretty ez ngl maybe make them a challenge next time 9/10

There re quite limited ways to pass each level ( usually only one way after several updates).To me, it feels more like going through a maze. The interesting moment is that when you come up with several ideas and in the end find none of them works :D It could be hard but enjoyable as well.

1517,2656,how
1518,2656,"Overall, this game is great, with a incredibly unique mechanic and some great puzzles. However some parts aren't perfect.GAMEPLAY:Its a basic game where you push stuff around, however, that's the perfect style for this game. my only complaint is that if you have to pull an object the controls get a little annoying.DIFFICULTY:Difficulty wise this game is strange. one level could be ridiculously easy and the next one incredibly hard, just something to look out for. basically, the worlds are grouped by a specific mechanic and not difficulty, and the level numbers basically mean nothing, level 15 could be easier than level 7 (i would suggest doing a whole ""island"" of levels at a time rather than in numerical order)PUZZLE DESIGN:This is also odd. BIY has some of my favourite puzzles of any game that exists, but also some disappointing ones. This is partly because some levels have an obvious end goal, and others just give you a ton of info to sort out, which isn't always bad but not good either. however the levels which are good in this game (most of them actually) are really good, and incredibly rewarding to complete.MECHANICS:the way gameplay mechanics are introduced are in form of new types of block (example, making something MOVE, or PUSH, or SINK). This game does a pretty good job at showing you what blocks do. It doesn't make you guess what things do, but it also doesn't tell you, it sort of goes ""mess around with this thing"" which then leads you into the main puzzles. My only complaint is that some mechanics are only used in like 5 levels and then never again (looking at you, GROUP), but the level editor should open up more opportunities for these mechanics.So to finish off, amazing game with a beautiful mechanic and art style but possibly not one you would want to get 100% completion in, unless you like ridiculously hard puzzles (just for reference one level took youtuber Aliensrock the most part of 3 hours to complete)"

1527,2656,Fun puzzle game.
1528,2656,You. Is. Entertained.
1529,2656,"Baba Is You is a fantastic and unique puzzle game. I really wasn't sure what to expect when I first heard about this game. I needed to do a lot of research to get a feel for what the gameplay consists of exactly, but once I decided to take a chance I was very glad I did so. In Baba Is You, the objective of each level is to reach the flag (or any object paired with ""is win"") by pushing blocks made up of a single word each to form sentences. It can be difficult to explain the nuances of the game without seeing it in action, but the game does a fantastic job of explaining its basic concept through the first few levels. The stages within each world get progressively more challenging, but fortunately, you're almost always sure to have beaten enough stages to unlock another world before feeling stuck, so you can bounce between a few different areas of the game as you think about any puzzles you're stuck on. That amount of freedom is helpful, because I often found myself really wanting to solve a puzzle I was stuck on, even after multiple tries, and only looked up solutions when I felt I ran out of options that I could come up with myself. This is to the game's credit, it makes you feel clever for solving its puzzles and sometimes even for trying different combinations of words to see how they will affect the objects you're given to work with. The only thing I would say is a negative about Baba Is You is that the mechanics of some words presented later in the game can feel a bit obtuse, even after completing the first level or two of the world that uses them. Once you get the hang of them though, the puzzles are still great and worth sitting with and giving the time to think about if you need to, so I encourage you to not get frustrated by any of the game's most tricky stages but give yourself a chance to work it out. It can be very satisfying to look at the tools you're given in any level and think about how the different words can be used to interact with each other and Baba Is You never makes trial and error feel like a chore.  If you enjoy puzzle games with a unique premise and clever design I highly recommend Baba Is You. I don't buy many games at full price, but I took a chance on Baba Is You and it was worth the asking price. It's a really great word-based game with a neat, simple aesthetic that's a must-have addition to any puzzle fan's library."
1530,2656,Conceptually simplistic and masterful in design.Baba Is You is a puzzle game that becomes surprisingly complex and constantly asks you to think outside the proverbial box.It's also a wonderful game to show to friends.  The game requires no explanation!  You can load it up and watch them learn and experiment with the bending and breaking of rules.
1531,2656,"It is pretty hard after the first few sections. These are some issues in the complexity design. However, it is overall an great game."

1537,2655,Game is Great
1538,2655,"This game is great. Too much for my brain though. When you see a solution or complete a level it feels like your brain grows, but then in the next level it gradually shrinks back to normal size and the cycle repeats.10/10 brain has never been used this much."
1539,2655,"My absolute favorite puzzle game of all time! Unlike some puzzles, where you might haphazardly stumble onto a solution, Baba Is You requires you to think and understand the solution for EVERY SINGLE LEVEL. Most people will do well enough to finish the normal game, but if you enjoy a serious puzzle challenge, going for 100% is sure to please!"
1540,2655,"This is an incredibly clever game that I would love to recommend. It's a shining example of indie games trying something new, and it's managed to come up with a truly unique spin on puzzle games.Unfortunately, it doesn't have a good handle on its own difficulty. About a third of the puzzles are solvable within five minutes, another third within an hour, and the last third are really, really hard. My experience was that either a level was entertaining in a cute way, or just head-banging-against-the-wall impossible. The difficulty distribution ought to have included many more 15-20 minute puzzles, long enough to be rewarding but short enough to keep you from going insane.I'm glad I tried it, but I wouldn't recommend it."
1541,2655,baba is really cute :3
1542,2655,baba is hard
1543,2655,Amazing game! Quite hard but super satisfying when you get stuck on something and figure it out :)
1544,2655,"great mechanics, great level design and fun aesthetic"
1545,2655,If your're looking for a challenging puzzle game that's really satisfying to solve then this is the game for you. It has a very unique mechanic of changing the rules of the level to get your character to the goal. I recommend this game for sure if you like puzzle games.
1546,2655,"As my first puzzle game in years, this is being a fairly challenging experience. The thing I like the most about this game is that it is based on a simple yet an extremely novel concept. You'll probably use your brain in a way that it has never been used. 10/10 for now...might update it once I finish the game."
1547,2655,"It takes some getting used to, but it's a great puzzle game once you get in sync with the game. Don't worry if you feel stupid at first, the game actually gets easier in some ways despite the levels getting harder because things will finally ""click""."

1551,2655,What a beautiful and original game. Playing with friends makes it even more fun!
1552,2655,Very challenging and lots of fun. The puzzles are so clever I feel like the maker of this game has to be a genius.
1553,2655,"I am one level away from completing the game (checked the wiki to check if I was done and found out I had one level to go) and this game blows my mind like none other. One great aspect of the game is that you encounter what seems like the same level multiple times, but each level has a slight mutation to it forcing you to think of creative new solutions to solve it. However, the best part about this game was that there were many instances where I had thought I completed a level only to revisit it and discover that there were more secrets waiting for me."
1554,2655,Great game. One o the best

1560,2655,"BABA is NOT a GAME for everyone. It requires huge attention to details, loads of patience and general LOVE for adventure/puzzle games. If you lack any of the before mentioned just go To start with, completing most of the game (or every single level if you are a hardcore) ALL BY YOURSELF takes a considerable amount of time. A lot of levels are very creative and the solutions are not right away obvious. But try not to look for the solutions on-line, as defeating levels is really rewarding and delivers a lot of satisfaction. I just needed one small hint in the entire game, almost at the very end, still I regret looking at it This is a typical problem-solution game, do not expect ultra graphics or musical symphonies, this is just a neat small game that was made for brain racking  and the task has been achieved.BABA is RECOMMENDEDBABA is ADVICE: if you find yourself stuck in one of the harder levels, try not to think about the game for a while (a few hours or even a day or two), because if you fixate yourself on a specific solution and a way to find it it is hard to detach yourself from the idea and only by being able to look anew at some levels will you be able to solve them."

1574,2654,"This is a GREAT (and I MEAN GREAT) GAME.First glance, you're probably thinking, ""Huh, this game seems like a quick and short game, I might not want to waste my money on this..."" HOWEVER, this game can take AT LEAST 12-20 HOURS TO COMPLETE (depends on how big-brain you are).

1579,2654,"Baba is You is not only extremely enchanting, it is immensely innovative, notoriously novel, and quite challenging. I've spent 7 hours ""in game"" at the time of this writing. Yet I have barely scratched the surface. Such a simple design with very well built logic and blocks has pushed me to think completely outside of the ordinary. Baba is You requires you to open yourself up to thinking both very logically as well as completely differently. The very space that you move in become a tool toward your goal of clearing a level. Nearly anything and everything is fair game, but is it useful?I keep trying to switch to another game and find myself opening it back up to try out new puzzles that I've unlocked.Such a Great Game!"

1585,2653,Incredibly powerful mechanics and well-designed puzzles leads to a challenging and rewarding experience
1586,2653,Challenging but fun.
1587,2653,really cool difficult game its nice
1588,2653,It's fun. Good puzzles. Makes you feel smrt.
1589,2653,"Preamble : For the love of god buy it if you like hard but creative puzzle games :Baba is you is an amazing puzzle game with great complexity that thoroughly explores its core design space of sokoban+logic puzzles, has a beautiful cutesy presentation, that doesn't waste your time and demands mastery from the player. The steep difficulty curve of the game coupled with its unwillingness to comprise on any challenge means it is aimed more towards tenacious and adept puzzle solver types. If this does not in some way describe you you are likely to grow frustrated with the game despite it's gleeful presentation and the creativity of most of the puzzles. For puzzle fans that like a challenge Baba is you is a steal and should not be skipped.Meanderings on the good: Minor gameplay spoilers ahead :The puzzles in baba is you are presented as a mixture of traditional sokoban puzzles as well as a unique ""binary rule"" system where in which the player can form sentences to affect the state and properties of game elements. The link between the two is that all game elements as well as all of the words that form the rules are sokoban blocks, which allows for relatively tight integration of the two and that comes together to form a system that is outwardly simple yet internally intricate. The sokoban aspect limits the variety of rules that can be formed by the player in an organic way which makes the rule side of things manageable in scope and intricate without bloating the board with rules that are only there to limit player actions. Restrictiveness in player action that misdirects from the true solution is the mark of a good puzzle, and this is one of the ways baba is you achieves it. This philosophy of not increasing difficulty by overwhelming the player with the sheer size of a problem (as many older puzzle games do) resonates throughout the game design of baba is you. All of the puzzles appear deceptively simple and are quick to parse yet they are unmistakably difficult. Most exude a flavour of difficulty that can only be described as requiring ""out of the box thinking"". It is truly remarkable that most puzzles in the game fall in this category of puzzle, which one would think would be reserved for a ""best"" and most creative minority of the puzzles. There is very little reuse and recycling of ideas, the challenge comes from deepening your understanding of the core sokoban/rule system it's edge cases and peculiarities, the periodic addition of new rules for fresh challenges and a steady increase in abstraction. All this I feel is a testament to the high quality of the game and the reason it is likely to be well liked by puzzle enthusiasts. Meanderings on the questionable: minor spoilers ahead:Previously I mentioned that there is little reuse of ideas, one could also take this to mean that there is little progression on the core concepts of baba is you. I believe this realization is mostly correct however in the previous section I've also layed out some of the ways in which baba is you subverts this issue. Still I think this fact does lend a somewhat tiresome/repetitive nature to the game since the player will effectively be doing relatively similar block puzzles from start to finish. Personally I don't think that the game overstays its welcome in this regard but the limitations do start to show as your level clear tally enters the triple digits. The last point on Baba is you's game design I want to discuss is a possible overeliance on edge cases and obtuse mechanics as the pay off to challenges. Although the rules are 100% consistent throughout the game I cannot help but feel certain peculiarities of the game system such as stacking impassable objects is perhaps overexploited to manufacture creative solutions. This is really the dark side of the ""the game is outwardly simple but somehow ultimately complex"" remark. If the game IS too simple to craft meaningful puzzles and unwilling to bloat the design space with many moving parts then exploration of obscure edge cases is almost a requirement. One of the frustration with these edge case based solutions is that they are often cumbersome to realize and hence difficult for the player to internalize, here the limitation of the sokoban system is perhaps a downfall; as the prerequisites for certain behaviours increase (e.g. synchronicity, multiple agents acting at once, rules flipping in and out at the exact right moment etc.)  it becomes increasingly tedious to experiment. I am not sure if ultimately this is a personal problem or a problem with the game but it is something that I felt progressing into the endgame that I felt was worth mentioning.  It is also not fair to say that ""out of the box"" is inherently obscure, many solutions/twists also fall in the ""hiding in plain sight"" category but of course these are uniquely satisfying in part because the novelty can only be experienced once; these cannot reasonably comprise the bulk of the content.Overall this is a game worth playing, it really has no glaring flaws and you may well disagree with what few issues I have listed in the previous section. Even if you are not particularly fond of hard puzzle games I suspect that the game is tightly designed enough that you may well enjoy the beginning of the game which is a little bit easier and less reliant on semi-obtuse solutions. In this case I think having ""too much game"" is a quality problem to have."
1590,2653,Very clever

1597,2653,"I always feel the sign of a good game is when I can look up at the clock and be surprised how much time has passed.  This is the case and then some with Baba Is You.  A lot of the puzzles look super simple when you glance at the stage, then you find out that putting your idea into action is not so simple.  I have spent hours on a leveling trying to make my idea work only to realize I was doing something completely wrong and that the real solution was much simpler.  Whether you're looking to pass a few minutes, or a few hours, Baba Is You is a great way to do it."
1598,2653,"Deep & complex puzzler where you control the rules, and even change the win condition to complete challenging levels. Despite the lack of story, the gameplay and rule manipulation combine in such intricate ways as to make this one of best games I have ever played. Even after logging many hours on various ""Worlds"", I have still only completed 2 of the 9 or so worlds available. Not to mention the ""Final Level"" which unlocks deceptively early and includes countless concepts and Verbs which are completely Greek to the novice Baba puzzler."
1599,2653,Game IS Hard

1608,2653,Excellent puzzle game.
1609,2653,"TL;DR Even if you are good at puzzle games this game requires a lot of lateral thinking and you may find it tough at the end. That said, it is supremely satisfying at all levels and well worth it even if you don't finish it.Baba Is You is clever. Very clever. Maybe too clever.The basic premise is simple to understand: you move around and push and pull objects. Included among those objects is the very rules of the puzzle like who you control, what keys do, what you can push etc.Each puzzle comes up with a clever way to utilize this premise. You will have many awesome ah-HA! moments throughout your play time. However, a lot of lateral thinking is required. And you will hit a wall sooner or later. I have enjoyed many puzzle games, and most I try and play to the end, but I found in this game I was hitting walls more and more often, and just getting stuck. I like puzzling things out but the game is very dependent on interlocking mechanics so there usually are no steps to tide you over during a puzzle... its basically all or nothing. So you will eventually find yourself sitting there, puzzling and puzzling, with nothing working and the game will reward your effort with nothing until you solve it all the way. Basically I eventually found the game a bit too hard and bit overwhelming. Entering levels with like 8 different rules elicited an audible groan from me. I don't think I am bad a puzzle games but maybe I am just bad at this puzzle game. Whatever the reason, I did eventually quit before finishing it.That said the time I did spend with it was well worth it.While puzzle games live and die by their gameplay, I did also want to say that even though the visual style does a have certain charm, I didn't like it much. The sound design I equally didn't care for. Not awful, but it did not draw me in."
1610,2653,"wonderful game, I broke my collarbone and was looking for a game to play one-handed to take my mind off the pain waiting for surgery, played for hours, beautiful in creating complex puzzles with such simple mechanics"
1611,2652,"It is a challenging puzzle game with really interesting mechanics and really more than it seems. Played it on Linux (native) with a guide to completion (one achievement is supposedly glitched), didn't really experience any technical difficulties - seems like a great port. Definitely worth picking up and playing through - even if you are stuck and have to use a guide - because you can see many clever tricks that are used in puzzle solutions."
1612,2652,good game
1613,2652,"One of the most innovative puzzle games I've ever played. It's the kind that sticks with you, even once you've shut the game down, meaning you're always kind of thinking about how to solve the puzzles. A true masterpiece."
1614,2652,"Baba is You is hard, I'm not going to lie. It's essentially all spatial reasoning, and finding clever ways to arrange things so that they interact with the other objects at exactly the right time or in exactly the right place. Spatial reasoning is not my strong suit. However, although I may not be good at this game, I absolutely appreciate how amazing it is.First of all, the unique word puzzle/block puzzle format this game presents is unlike any other I've come across before, and the way the words can interact in pretty much any form and the limits that those interactions place on the world are so unique and interesting. If nothing else, buy Baba is You just to witness how it works. It's truly mind-boggling, but that comes with the added perk of feeling really, really smart when you solve a puzzle.Second of all, the graphics, music, and sound effects are incredibly cute. The game is all 2-D, with some interesting elements added later (I won't mention what they are, though- buy the game!). Pretty much every element is rendered in a cute, rounded, solid-color style that is just so pleasant to look at. The music is cute, light, and perfectly sets the mood to keep from getting frustrated.As for frustration, like I said, Baba is You is a hard game. I'm biased, but I have several friends who've also played it, and they agree with me: it's far from easy. But the vast majority of the puzzles in this game are just on the right side of toothsomely difficult, rather than frustrating. They invoke thought in a way I haven't found any other game to do- a product of the game's unique block-word interface yet again- and encourage experimentation, trial and error, and quite literally thinking out of the block. I cannot recommend this game enough."
1615,2652,Good
1616,2652,"Very unique puzzle solving. Haven't played a puzzle game this good since Portal. Fun, satisfying, challenging."

1621,2652,a nice pixel game that makes you feel dumb when you get the answer after noodling it out for 23 minutes A LOT of levels...... my poem about baba is you: roses are red violets are blue baba likes icecream and baba is you!the game drive you insane if you arent big brain
1622,2652,"I love core concept behind Baba is You and I think it's a very cool twist on Sokoban, but the game's pacing makes you burn out really quick. You will spend hours figuring out a level only to learn that nothing you did will carry over to the next stage. You are constantly starting from ground zero, with no breaks whatsoever. Each world's structure is essentially:- Introduce new mechanics in a few levels at the start- Complex levels that ask you to reverse engineer the mechanics you just learned- Bonus levels that completely flip the new mechanics on their head with pre-existing level layouts, just with slightly different block placement, forcing you to start from scratch (very frustrating)If you're supposed to blindly reverse engineer solutions to the levels until you stumble across the answer, that isn't good puzzle design. That's just a frustrating waste of my time."
1623,2652,"god i'm so  ANGRY why is this game so GOOD???? i had high expectations after watching the trailer and it was still even better than i expected. there are so many cool interactions to mess around and figure out and just when you think you've seen it all, BOOM the game takes a massive  on your head (in a good way). 10/10 this is puzzle game perfection"

I'm not sure the puzzles are all entirely ""fair"" in teaching you their rules, but that's very subjective, and not an issue most of the time. There's lots of silly situations and fun experimentation you can do. The base game really feels complete. It never stays on the same idea for too long, and it covers every idea as fully as you would want. Custom levels are thing too, so there's lots of potential there."

So far I have not encountered too many that involve timing in some manner, as I personally think those are the most difficult.  You really do have to think a lot, and when you get stuck try to take a break and come back to it another day.  I like the visuals of the game as well."

1690,2649,Best puzzle game that I have ever played. My brain is melting and I love it
1691,2649,You would think that you would get better at thinking outside the box as the game progressed.  Ive almost finished the game and the levels stump me just as much as they ever did.
1692,2649,I don't think i'm smart enough to play this game but that little critter Baba sure is cute
1693,2649,good
1694,2649,"Best, most challenging, and fair puzzle game you'll ever play. Super addictive. The bonus puzzles also aren't a grueling scavenger hunt like they are in the witness."
1695,2649,"Very creative and interesting puzzler. Be warned though, it is HARD! I'm not even halfway done with the game and I have 6 hours played."
1696,2649,Best puzzle solving game ever.
1697,2649,9/10 A must play for anyone who likes puzzle games.
1698,2649,Cool puzzle game
1699,2649,Baba is fun.
1700,2649,"It's such a great game, unlike anything else. I've played it for 40 hours now and I still haven't beat all the levels yet."
1701,2649,pretty pog puzzle game
1702,2649,My favorite programming language? Baba Is You.
1703,2649,Baba is now my favorite programming language.
1704,2649,"Estremamente complesso, ma onesto. Le regole sono tutte sullo schermo, basta imparare come usarle."
1705,2649,WHATHOW
1706,2649,Don't think it's worth full price. I still have to finish it tho : /
1707,2649,Challenging and fascinating.
1708,2649,"amazing logic game, been playing it for so long and i still uncover new stuff. absolutely wonderful"
1709,2649,"I have 0 patience for this game. It is so boring to me, I was hoping for something more interactive but all you do is move stuff around. It doesn't even make sense. I understand that you unlock abilities by moving stuff around but even the first level- how does it even make sense?? It got me so furious I can't play it anymore :D"
1710,2649,Fun and excruciating hard
1711,2648,"A challenging but simple puzzle game, great for the odd 10 minutes here and there"
1712,2648,Best puzzle game I've ever played.

1715,2648,this is a really fun and challenging game! you have to get this game!
1716,2648,This is a good game.
1717,2648,"Best puzzle game ever created, IT IS A MUST BUY"
1718,2648,Game Is Good
1719,2648,It's a master piece of a puzzle game.Go read the negativ reivews they are hilarious XD
1720,2648,"what begins as pure logic, slowly becomes some of the most difficult puzzles imaginable- but, when you finish them you will feel: ""I am the greatest puzzle master of all time!"""
1721,2648,"This game has easily one of the best game concepts ever. Its deceptively simple yet so effective and often very challenging as you will come to find. I admit to looking up a guide for one or two levels and I'm nowhere near done. If I was you don't look up guides just be frustrated because finding the solution is quality. I believe they might be adding a level editor which only increases this games value. So please if you enjoy puzzle games cop this bad boy. If logic and thought isn't your thing this might not be your game but don't rule it out because the messiah said so, check it out, try it for yourself and make you're own judgement, happy gaming people.Many regards,Jesus"
1722,2648,BABA IS GOOD
1723,2648,BABA IS FUN
1724,2648,Very challenging and fun puzzle-like game
1725,2648,"This is an extremely creative puzzle game. Extremely innovative. Mechanics are always deep and interact with each other in interesting ways. The soundtrack is good, and so are the fun scribbled-like graphics. Overall, a really great game."
1726,2648,brain is melt
1727,2648,"Baba is awesome. Wonderful puzzles. Very smooth and engaging gameplay. The rules are not always entirely clear which can lead to some head-scratching moments, but incredibly clever and satisfying game design."
1728,2648,"It takes puzzle solving and out side the box thinking to a whole new level, it is sometimes unfair how hard these levels can get, but oh so rewarding to beat and learn. Guides are suggested for hints, but one should be able to figure everything out if they trail and error long enough. 10/10 Solid Puzzle game. Baba Is Good."
1729,2647,Just wonderful. Easy to use. Perplexing and thought provoking puzzles. And nice way the graphics is easy to use on a screen and saves easily.
1730,2647,GAME is GOODisHARDBRAIN is NOT SMART
1731,2647,It is really creative with simple interface and rules.
1732,2647,I'm too dumb to beat this
1733,2647,Brain is BreakLogic/word puzzles that get complex real quick. My brain hurts after playing this. Yet it's very addicting and makes you want to go back to it.Cute graphics and soundtrack.Would break my brain again. Game is buy.

1740,2647,brain is melt
1741,2647,This game is very clever and enjoyable.
1742,2647,Great puzzles and awesome concept with a good execution
1743,2647,Awesome puzzles. Simple Gameplay
1744,2647,"A masterpiece, I cannot describe how fun and challenging this game is"
1745,2647,"Pretty original game, it is a puzzle game, but not like any other i have played. I got it with 20% off, i'd have payd full price."
1746,2647,"This is such a good idea. And the levels start out simple and you feel very clever for figuring them out. And then they're viciously difficult. And so far, that's only gotten me, like, halfway through what is either the whole game or one big chunk of the game. I no longer feel very clever. And yet, clearly there is a solution. This game could be titled ""I Hate Baba"", is what I'm saying. But in a good way."
1747,2647,Great game for big brain gamers
1748,2647,"Best puzzle game I've ever played, not even close."
1749,2647,baba is great

1751,2647,Baba is good
1752,2647,"Incredible gameOne of the all time greats, everyone should experience it"
1753,2647,I just want Baba to be happy but these puzzles are so hard!
1754,2647,"Awesome game,Must play to help you think out of the box for any problem you may face,including in your life"
1755,2647,"Very fun brain tickler that escalates difficulty nicely butWhen the game hits you with the baba is baba and a has, that's how you know  about to hit the fan because the levels requires a box and box has key but there is no box so the only way is to make baba a box but baba is baba so you'd want baba is you and has box and baba is weak but then baba won't be baba if baba is a box and there isn't enough is' or and's to make baba has box and is you and is weak so then you're left scratching your head like a twit, speaking to your friends like you're having a STROKE and nothing ends up accomplished.10/10 fantastic game."
1756,2647,"One of the best puzzle games I've ever played. Most puzzles have a unique solution and require outside the box thinking, as opposed to just building on the same mechanic. Worth full price. If you like puzzle games just get it."
1757,2647,This was one of the most mind boggling puzzle games ever made. Highly recommend!
1758,2647,Baba is good
1759,2647,"Baba is You is a fantastic game.Unfortunately, after very enjoyable 14 hours where I finished every regular and extra level from worlds 1 to 6, I got stumped at world 7 (levels 5, 6, 7 and 1st bonus level), took a break, and then couldn't get back into the game.I am not sure whether that's because I lost my groove (and I actually can pick the game back up after an acclimation period), ......or whether because that's the point of the game where Sokoban-style block pushing and spatial skills become truly relevant (mine are so bad that I can't enjoy XCom-style combat and Antichamber was very easy to navigate for me).The bottom line is:Will you enjoy the game? Most likely.Will you be able to complete the game? Depends.[/list]"
1760,2647,"this game is so fun! a game about changing the rules in order to beat the game itself. one of the best thinking games out there if not the best!i totally recommend this game to all kids, teens and adults of all interests because one thing is for sure, BABA IS FUN"
1761,2647,It got the awards. It deserved them. Just play this if you like puzzle games.

1766,2647,"As someone who has always prided themselves on their critical thinking and puzzle solving ability, this game is HARD. I absolutely love it. I've spent plenty of time staring at the puzzles and attacking them from every angle, until finally hitting that AHA! moment where it all comes together and I get through. This game is one of a kind, and people who aren't puzzle solvers will enjoy it just as much- 100% completion isn't required to beat the game and there are plenty of easier levels so that everyone will have a path through. But for those who want the challenge, there is sure enough going to be enough stages to always keep you thinking."
1767,2647,My brain hurts.
1768,2647,"It's worth experiencing, but a head's up, the later levels eschew the initially fun concept of re-arranging blocks in a straightforward manor, in favor of Sokoban-style gameplay where the challenge is not really finding out how to rearrange words to fit the concept, but maneuvering the words and objects in really tight spaces. It gets pretty boring after that, although I was able to skip a lot of these stupid Sokoban levels and still was able to finish most levels in every world."
1769,2646,This game WILL break your brain (in the best way possible)
1770,2646,I like mind-messing puzzles
1771,2646,"This is such a cute and funny puzzle game. It gets pretty hard at times, but that's part of what makes it fun."
1772,2646,good
1773,2646,Fun and challenging puzzles but the opportunity to skip some and still progress when stumped. Great music and aesthetic.
1774,2646,The best puzzle game ever conceived!
1775,2646,Baba is difficult :(But my brain feels smart when I win :)
1776,2646,"Like postmodernist Sokoban, if that were made of brain candy. A real step outward on the frontier of game design, and a constant delight to play. People are going to be talking about this one for decades."
1777,2646,"Tbh, its one of my favorite puzzle games of all time"
1778,2646,Box has Box is You
1779,2646,"So  good....... the logical expressions make you feel like you are helping develop the gameBut the later levels are so complicated, so difficult and time consuming, the difficulty curve is a right angle triangle8/1010 for less complicated"
1780,2646,idiot is me
1781,2646,"Incredibly creative puzzler. Someone on Reddit recommended playing as a family, and yeah it definitely works. Good times!"
1782,2646,"Very difficult puzzles, yet all the puzzles abide by the rules that have been set by the game, which are the rules that you set."
1783,2646,I spent an hour hating myself and accomplishing nothing in this game today. I'll be back tomorrow.
1784,2646,"its pretty good for a puzzle game, but its no Blue's Big Musical for PS1. But that's just my humble gamer opinion 8/10"
1785,2646,Super creative and hard puzzles
1786,2646,Fabulous masterpiece. Makes you think in a whole different way. Have not ever recommended any game to as many friends

1789,2646,Frustrating at times but worth the money!baba is <3
1790,2646,"The most inventive puzzler I've ever played. Some levels are quite challenging, but it always feels very rewarding when you find the solution. New elements are introduced in a fair manner and reward experimentation as you develop your expanding lexicon. There are so many levels revealed as you advance, but not all are required to complete the core gameplay. Bonus levels serve to further challenge you but are appropriately entertaining and clever. Overall, such a dense and unique game, and I know there are many things I haven't discovered yet."
1791,2646,"Sokoban + Game mechanic-changing puzzle = Baba is youMinimalistic aesthetics of the game put you in very calm, meditative mood."
1792,2646,Love it.
1793,2646,"This game is so clever, I cannot stop thinking about it. The game is really fun and unique. It is hard, like really hard, but that's just what I need. I recommend this game to anyone who seeks a fun and challanging game."
1794,2646,Best puzzle game ever played
1795,2646,"very fun, very cool. would definitely recommend"
1796,2646,The most innovative and addicting puzzle game I've ever played. Charming as can be.
1797,2646,It's very challenging and it keeps you coming back to try and see if you've gotten smarter.
1798,2646,brain hurt 100
1799,2646,"Head scratching but logical puzzles. Some are too hard after like the fifth island, but then you see the solution online and your mind gets blown."
1800,2646,baba is you is an exceptionally unique puzzle game. the main premise is that you are allowed to edit the very rules of the universe by pushing around little blocks of text. this can lead to a cascade of wonderful puzzles that are all uniquely crafted with their own amazing solutions.
1801,2645,"Very simple concept but very powerful possibilities that are indeed explored!Nice soundtrack that accompanies you in the inevitable pondering. There's a lot of screen looking, mental block moving and sudden realisations that give that nice aha moment."
1802,2645,"I love the concept, but it seems random to me.  I had to look up one puzzle.  I figured most of it out, but there were several words I tried to 'kill' this thing with, no go.  Looking it up there was a specific word I had to use to kill the thing.  I thought I had tried it but I must not have.  It seems so random it seems more like a trial and error game than a puzzle game.It seems like a puzzle game to me should let me look at the level and be able to figure out what to do without randomly trying to use every word in every way."
1803,2645,It's relaxing and hard but the little guys bounce so nicely so even when you're stuck it's happy times
1804,2645,I like it!
1805,2645,",Well...There are Vietnamnese and Portuguese, but not Chinese, a language used by basically 20% of the world's population. I understand that this is a game based on words, but guess there are not much barrier in translating into Chinese though,..Anyway, good game but not recommended (WE NEED CHINESE! Please localize it!)."
1806,2645,"While the puzzle genre is alive and ever-expanding, it's very rare to come upon a game that challenges you on such a non-intuitive level as this game does.Baba Is You combines simple Sokoban-style puzzles with linguistic rules, allowing you to alter the properties of objects in a level. This results in a game that effectively requires lateral thinking all the way through; often stumping you in every level, and asking for you to consistently change the paradigms you're thinking in.I strongly recommend this game to both lovers of the genre and newbies alike as I'm sure both groups can enjoy this title."
1807,2645,"Really awesome puzzles, the difficulty level is on the harder end of the spectrum of all puzzle games I have ever played. For some of the puzzles, you really have to think outside the box which I really like. I am hoping to see a sequel some day!"
1808,2645,"I feel as dumb as a sack of rocks, 10/10"
1809,2645,Baba is You is Great          Brain is Melt            Me is Addicted on Game                                                                                 is                                                                               Hot                                Game is Fun and Addicting                               Time is Stop when Play
1810,2645,"this is a really good game, but you will have to treat it like a casual game, cus it feels like a chess game where you need to calculate every step and see if the outcome is favourable for you, except you dont know the rules of chess, that what it feels like to me at least, this game teaches you that rules are non-existent and you will start to hate life and question why you even live in the first place"
1811,2645,Extraordinary intellectual game!
1812,2645,"Absolutely mind-bending puzzles, and a fascinating mechanic.  I love it.  Punishingly hard, and I wouldn't have it any other way."
1813,2645,One of the best games of all time!
1814,2645,"So frustrating at times, incredibly satisfying at others."
1815,2645,The main concept is so creative I can't put it into words. The difficulty increases to be a very serious challenge. Completing levels feels really good.
1816,2645,Good Puzzle game with a variety of levels and complexity. Worth the price.
1817,2645,this game has a cool concept but is actually not that fun
1818,2645,It's a great puzzle game & I would not hesitate to recommend it; it's a solid 5 stars.
1819,2645,good puzzle game
1820,2645,GAME is GOOD
1821,2645,"Very well designed levels, huge amount of content and game mechanics. Best puzzle game I've played"
1822,2644,"big fan of puzzle games, and this one is really unique!"
1823,2644,hard as 
1824,2644,Twas pretty good
1825,2644,This is the best and most mind boggling game I've ever played or seen.
1826,2644,"super difficult and you might need a guide at some point, but its REALLY fun and has some interesting plot twists! (or whatever you're supposed to call what happens) if you're stuck, try imagining every combination of words you can make, or the positions you can make them in, or in some levels, imagine where you can move without activating something you shouldn't, or just try your random theories and see if anything looks promising, not every game is for everyone, and this is no exception, but baba is you is a fun and challenging puzzle game that I definitely love!"
1827,2644,"I didn't like this game. I should've looked into it more than I did, but I've been trying to expand my horizons and I thought this would be a nice introduction to the puzzle genre. It makes a great puzzle game, and if you are into that, go ahead and buy it. I'm giving it a thumbs up to rely that information, I'm not going to down vote it because it doesn't fit my tastes. Just a caution to others - don't fall into the same trap I did. I saw the 98% positive, and jumped at the chance to buy it. If you don't like puzzle games, this isn't the one for you. As a wise man once said, ""If it's not fun, why bother?""."
1828,2644,Proof I'm idiot
1829,2644,"This is  a great, and suprisingly long, puzzle game that annoyed the hell out of me. The difficulty ramps up at a good rate but there were quite a few times, notably when I'd put the game down for a day or two before resuming, when a mechanic made no sense to me and I was stuck on a puzzle, e.g. some of the bonus MOVE puzzles. I love the way the game explores grammar and squeezes every ounce of meaning from each word. Personally I found some of the puzzles too hard but with enough time I think they're within reach!The character design and artwork is minimal but super cute. I really enjoyed Baba (who is a sheep right? Is that established?).Recommendation for first-time players: don;t play this too casually or you'll forget the rules! :)"
1830,2644,bab a
1831,2644,BABA is YOUREVIEW IS GOODISGAME IS HARD AND CHALLENGING AND CLEVER AND NOT NOT FUN
1832,2644,"The difficulty progression is very fine-tuned. I felt every level was a challenge, but not too much harder than the last. And there are SO MANY of them! I will love this game for a while"
1833,2644,BABA IS BEST
1834,2644,This game is a must play for anyone with even a passive interest in puzzle games.Wickedly hard. Extremely rewarding.  Just get it.
1835,2644,"Absolutely genius puzzle game with mechanics I've never seen before, in any game. It's somewhat addicting, and it's just difficult enough to be extremely rewarding after figuring out a level while not making you rage-quit. Definitely worth buying!"
1836,2644,Baba is hard and 10/10

1839,2644,BABA IS FUN AND HARD
1840,2644,Amazing concept
1841,2644,"Baba Is You is perhaps the most fun puzzle game I've ever played.  Having beat what I _believe_ to be all but one level, feel confident saying that there are very few puzzles that don't give you that delightful moment of realization upon discovery of a successful solution.  I bounced off of similar sokoban style puzzle games like ""stephen's sausage roll"" but found the ramping up of difficulty of ""Baba Is You"" to be just right.I cannot recommend this game highly enough, don't skip this masterpiece!Also: the music is delightful :)"
1842,2644,baba is fun
1843,2643,great game
1844,2643,"The puzzles are sometimes pretty easy (in the beginning at least, I'm not yet that far) but they are still entertaining because they keep introducing new ways to think about the same mechanics with a hint of irony."
1845,2643,"I've seen the concept of meta-rules discussed before, but I don't think I've ever actually seen it used it a game before now. If you like thinking about, and playing with, game rules, you'll like this game.(Well, you need to like Sokoban too, I guess.)"
1846,2643,Puzzles are hard
1847,2643,Baba has ASS is HOT
1848,2643,"The idea is amazing and unique. The execution is questionable.+ Admirably amazing concept+ Overall style of the game- Pieces sometimes don't work as expected or pass through each other when they shouldn't- The game looses it's mind within first hour and expects 301 IQ plays in ""on-rails"" levels- Expensive"
1849,2643,baba
1850,2643,"Best puzzle game of 2019-2020. Ignore the hours spent on Steam. I have 40+ on Switch.The game is difficult, but it doesn't start off that way. It eases you into the game very well. It's okay if you get stuck too, because you can drop one puzzle and take a different route. Then come back later. The music is nice. Never noticed any bugs. Easily 100+ hours of content."
1851,2643,Hard puzzle game. Loads of fun. V cute. Lots of depth.

1870,2643,much good game that is big brain
1871,2643,very good game
1872,2643,"Great and fun puzzle game. I had a co-worker recommend it to me and I have enjoyed to. The levels get significantly harder as the game progresses, so expect to get stuck just staring at levels to figure out what to do. Supper gratifying to solve a puzzle all on your own."
1873,2643,"It's very clever and very cerebral which is much appreciated. I never feel pressed for time, just pressed for brainpower to wrap myself around the puzzles properly."
1874,2643,"Baba.Ok yeah to sum it up, this is one of the best puzzle games I have played. Get it if you like having your brain hurt"
1875,2643,

1880,2642,Very creative
1881,2642,Adds wrinkles to my brain
1882,2642,I LOVE puzzle games and this one is incredibly unique and scratches my brain in just the right way. Plus I love how  Meta the game gets towards the end. *chefs kiss*
1883,2642,"This game uses one simple mechanic and extends it to create the most brain-activating scenarios. That's a boon in any game, but especially so for a puzzle game. Streaming this for a few of my friends was fun for them to watch. The graphics fit the nature of the game well. In terms of difficulty, it scales appropriately. After a few worlds, I began to feel hopelessly lost in most levels, but I know that if I go back to them, they'll seem incredibly easy. I have not completed the game yet (and honestly haven't played it for about a month now because of work and other games), but it's something I plan on going back to."
1884,2642,"Very mindbending, very epic"
1885,2642,Brain malfunction
1886,2642,By far one of the best puzzle games I have payed in a while. You cant get better than this in difficulty and enjoyment. (ok maybe snakebird is pretty high there as well)
1887,2642,[game] on [pc] is [good] and [fun] and not [bad]
1888,2642,The hardest puzzle game I've played.
1889,2642,"the game has a fantastic concept, i'm just too dumb to figure it out"
1890,2642,"This may just be my favorite puzzle game ever. I'm typically not very good at picking favorites, but this game is a strong contender. I'm pretty sure you know what the gimmick is, but if for some reason you haven't and you're reading this review, Baba Is You is a game about changing its own rules. The rules are physical words that you can push around, and doing this allows you to change the way the world works. ""WALL IS STOP""? Just separate the words to literally ""break"" the rule. Now you can walk through walls. You can also put together words to create your own rules, which is how you'll be solving many of the levels.Many levels have rules that can't be broken in order to preserve the challenge, but there's a lot you can do with this gimmick, and Baba Is You will blow your mind again and again with each new type of rule it introduces, allowing you to do things you may not have thought would be possible. The level design does a good job of teaching you new gameplay mechanics without long-winded tutorials and explanations, and the later levels will really test your critical thinking skills. Some of them have more than one possible solution.I highly recommend playing this game without looking at spoilers, because there are some big ""woah"" moments that just won't have the same impact when you read about them instead of experiencing them ingame. There's even an official level editor on its way, but even without the level editor this game is worth playing. As a matter of fact, once the level editor update comes out, I'd advise not messing around with it until you've played through the main game first, because it will spoil a lot of those ""woah"" moments I was talking about. Can't think of anything else I want to say, so I'll just add one bit of advice if you plan on playing it: Don't feel obligated to 100% the game before clearing ""A Way Out?"". I'm not going to explain why, I just think it's for the best."
1891,2642,Completely mind bending puzzle game. It's rare to play something that constantly has you thinking outside of the box. Definitely reminds me of Portal 2 is term of clever solutions.
1892,2642,Really hard logic puzzles.
1893,2642,A fantastic puzzle game with a difficulty curve like a cardiograph on a steady incline.
1894,2642,it's good but too hard for me
1895,2642,The most innovative puzzle game I've played in years!
1896,2642,"You have to get Win.It's a really simple rule.Baba is You, for now.Flag is Win, for now.So you can control and move Baba to Flag to clear the level, for now.Yes, FOR NOW."
1897,2642,Baba is good
1898,2642,insane puzzle game
1899,2642,Best puzzle game ever.
1900,2642,"If you love puzzle games, you have to get this one. It's incredibly engaging and creative, not to mention fun. It requires a lot of lateral thinking, and unmentioned mechanics that may lead to a lot of secrets. Incredibly fun if you try to solve the levels with friends, too. :)"
1901,2642,hard but good
1902,2642,Makes me feel dumb and like a genius at the same time!  Really well designed puzzle game that rewards thinking outside the box.  I'd highly recommend this game to anyone even remotely interested in coding at some point as it forces you to think in terms of modules.
1903,2642,g
1904,2642,"Unlike so many other puzzle games, this game doesn't punish you for experimenting. If you screw up, you can easily undo as many moves as you want. There's no life counter, no move counter, and no timer. As far as the game's concerned, solving a level in an hour with a thousand moves is just as good as finding the optimal solution straight away.See the other reviews for details about what makes this game great -- I just wanted to outline one aspect of the game that I particularly appreciate."
1905,2642,cool game
1906,2642,Yes
1907,2642,Hooray programming-style logic puzzles. Very fun and unique.
1908,2642,10/10 difficulty and fun
1909,2642,"Just an amazingly good puzzle game. A pretty similar vein (and difficulty level) to Snakebird, so if you've played that and enjoyed it I definitely recommend."
1910,2642,Baba Is You And Good.
1911,2642,GAME IS HARDISFUN
1912,2642,"Most puzzles are very clever and a great exercise in lateral thinking, a few others are less interesting and make you do all possible combinations in a specific order.  Nevertheless, very few games are as creative as this one."
1913,2641,Great game. Pretty addictive. Promotes lateral thinking and searching for creative solutions.
1914,2641,"Wonderful, puzzles, really gets you thinking about the world differently."
1915,2641,"This game takes the simple concept of little text-based logical puzzles and builds on it in ways I couldn't have imagined!  It's a perfect game to play for those ""a-ha"" moments, where you realize that the solution is right in front of you.  That's part of the fun- always knowing that the pieces are in place even if it seems like something is missing.  The cute graphic design also makes this game's world charming and easy to understand."
1916,2641,"if you like puzzles and puzzle games and aha moments, this is a thing you would like."
1917,2641,"This game is light-hearted, aesthetically pleasing, and has clever gameplay and level design. It is a fun challenge that keeps you thinking outside the box."
1918,2641,yesh
1919,2641,Excellent puzzler. May be trying at first but the enjoyment is great when you start realizing the mechanics.
1920,2641,Great puzzles. Mind-boggingly delightful
1921,2641,good
1922,2641,"I am yet to see a puzzle game more dissapointing. It advertises as a thinking man game where you make the rules but it is a lie! Levels have a single solution, game punished me for innovating over and over. It is you who follows the rules of the game, not the other way. And the game is really bad at explaining too.Just play talos principle and enjoy the game with adequate and logical puzzles. Baba is not you, baba is ."
1923,2641,"This is by a huge margin the best puzzle game ever made, truly a work of genius unlike any other, how can a puzzle game be so simple and easy to understand yet get so mind-bogglingly complex. I am over 100 hours in despite what is on record, mostly just staring at a stage and scratching my head, it can get frustrating but the satisfaction of finally figuring out a stage you have been struggling with is worth every second. Anybody who enjoys figuring things out for themselves will fall in love with this game, I guarantee it. I really must stress that you figure things out yourself though, you get one chance to experience that, looking up the answer will rob you of it (and you might end up leaving a negative review complaining that using a walkthrough wasn't satisfying like SOME people lollll). I'd recommend this game basically to every single person on earth that has a functioning brain."
1924,2641,Game IS goodI would say it takes out of the box thinking but most of the time you're turning the box into rocks so rock on I guess
1925,2641,"Big brain game. It's pretty fun figuring things out. When you get stumped, but find a way to beat the level, you feel as if your brain increases in size. Though the downside is if you can't figure it out, you feel small brain :("
1926,2641,Makes your brain hurt in a good way
1927,2641,"I recommend Baba Is You for anyone who enjoys difficult word games and puzzle games. The simple layout of the game is a deception, but it makes it easy to remember the puzzle and put the game down for a while to really think about it properly. Discovering the solutions on my own feels very satisfying, although I often find my brain melting."
1928,2641,Baba is difficult and original and fun. Dumb is you.
1929,2641,Cool
1930,2641,Huge and challenging puzzle with unique mechanics that mixes Sokoban and programming.
1931,2641,It's a fun game that make you think.
1932,2641,"Very good game! Challenging puzzles and unique vibe, its a fun one! Worth the $"
1933,2641,Baba == You
1934,2641,This game is genius.
1935,2641,I'm too stupid for puzzel games
1936,2641,"This is at its very heart a push and slide puzzle and I really really hate push and slide puzzles. However, it is much more than that and this game is extremely interesting and very well made. Really great concept, it definitely tickles the programming problem solving part of the brain. I just hate push and slide puzzles."
1937,2641,"reviews aren't lying, this game makes me feel dumb. great game tho"
1938,2641,Baba is Hard and GoodisFun
1939,2641,"This game is difficult and I love it. Each level presents a unique challenge. My friend and I both got this game and we work together on levels, which I highly recommend. Because this game does cost money, I always feel weird looking up solutions, but playing with a friend is both fun and a great way to think of new ideas.I dont think Im super far into the game but some levels I spend 30 minutes to an hour on, and every time finding out the solution is 100% worth it.10/10 please get this game"

1969,2640,"Out-of-the-box thinking, logic puzzles that are creative, elegant, and addicting.  Sometimes the puzzles can be so challenging that I would think ""Oh there's probably some dumb, unintuitive interaction here that I don't know about"", but after looking up the solution, I would realize that it was staring me right in the face the whole time.  Every solution is clear and well-designed, never leaving the player feel cheated or tricked.  I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys creative problem solving."
1970,2640,By far the most original game I've seen in a while.#BabaIsCool #BabaAuRhum
1971,2640,"Ever wanted to change the rules to solve a puzzle? Well, here you'll have to!This is a great puzzle game with a truly unique concept, where you manipulate both objects AND rulesets which make them what they are. The rules are extremely intuitive - although you sometimes have to experiment a little to decipher their childish grammar. Like, ""door is shut"" means exactly that, but ""key is open"" means ""key can be used to open anything that is shut"". Each ""area"" in the game starts out easy, allowing you to experiment and get used to all the new elements it introduces (objects, rules, keywords like ""and"" or ""has"", or simply new ways of using what you've already seen). And then it gives you some REAL puzzles.And the best part is how crazy the solutions are, since you can literally change anything as long as the setup includes rule keywords to do it! Sure, some rules are often fixed by putting their words someplace you can't push them around, but even that sometimes is a clever deception (I've already encountered a puzzle which required me to disable a rule which seemed fixed at first).A definite must-play if a puzzle game is what you are looking for right now."

2001,2639,"Delightful. Unique. Addicting.I played every day until I beat every level. Finally discovering each new interaction to solve each puzzle was just as exhilarating in the final levels as it was in the very beginning. Even if you aren't a huge fan of traditional puzzle games, this game might still be for you."
2002,2639,"the ""final"" level is pretty easy to get to but you'll probably need to finish the rest of the game to even attempt to finish itbut if you do, don't delete the game thinking you've seen all it has to offerthere's always more.also don't attempt to finish this game without hints unless you actively want to die"

2015,2639,"While I recommend this game wholeheartedlyhll, this is my favorite puzzler of all timethere is a certain downside to Baba Is You.Puzzles have only one intended solution, and the developer routinely patches out alternative ways to solve puzzles. As somebody noted, despite this being the game about thinking out of the box, this is also a game about thinking inside the developer's box. This leads to some levels having incredibly convoluted solutions, and some prohibiting the same complexity in favor of more streamlined formula. And you can never guess which is which, so I found myself being stuck because I was overestimating or underestimating how complicated the puzzle was, not because it was any difficult.Don't get me wrong, the game is absolutely brilliant, and I love it dearly. However, the complexity rollecoaster is very annoying, especially late into the game. If you have little patience, this is definitely not a game for you."
2016,2639,"This game is ridiculously challenging yet so much fun. My hours are probably inflated by 15-20 hours because I left the game on, but that is still 70+ hours of gameplay. I've still got the last world to complete too. This has been a great game to keep my mind sharp during quarantine and I will be sad when I beat it as it has become a part of my morning routine to wake up and play this game for 30ish minutes to get my mind going. If you like puzzle games, especially challenging ones, you should get this game. If you can beat this game without looking up any hints you're a legend or you have some insane tenacity."
2017,2639,game is good
2018,2639,"Up there as one of the greatest puzzle games in recent times. Mind-bending, fun, and a heck of a challenge.As every meta-puzzler is known to do, Baba is You forces you to discard your old perceptions of what should be the norm. No longer will your rocks be push and your walls be stop. Baba is You asks you to politely make the game your own, and change the rules as you see fit... to an extent.Of course, changing the rules will change the rules on how you can change the rules. As the game's rules become more meta, just as equally will the levels become more difficult. As the words which spell out your rules become affected by the rules themselves, your initial assumptions about the game and its worlds become nothing more than lies you tell to comfort yourself.This game is too hard. I love it."

2024,2639,BABA IS HARD
2025,2638,This game is making me lose my  mind. It might be the best puzzle game I've ever played.
2026,2638,"It's like the extreme think out of the box puzzle game.I have not played that much yet, but the difficulity seems to ramp up pretty quickly.It is a unique and mind breaking puzzle game, so beware some levels can get you stuck for a LONG time.So in short : Baba Is Hard, but Baba is recommended."
2027,2638,levels are challenging and very satisfying to figure out
2028,2638,"Deceptively simple rules and controls morph into a mind bending puzzle game where you learn, unlearn, and relearn rules constantly. Highly recommended for people who need a new and creative puzzle game!"
2029,2638,"Great game concept with terrible level design and a depressing soundtrack.The main issue is that levels generally allow for too much complexity and possible combinations, and you need to implement really precise and complex solutions to solve them. You never know whether you haven't thought of the handful of counter-intuitive ideas you need to use simultaneously to solve a puzzle, not been able to stumble on the correct implementation among thousands, or not understanding correctly a game rule as they're never explained. It's all of the annoyances of Sokoban, but much, much worse.If you want a great puzzle game, try Recursed instead."
2030,2638,i hate this game so much sometimes
2031,2638,Quite possibly the greatest JRPG on the market

2038,2638,"The puzzles in Baba is You are fiendishly difficult but very rewarding. Who would have thought that from simple ""is"" and ""has"" statements, one could find so much structure? A very well thought out game."
2039,2638,"This game can be hard at times, and I wouldn't be surprised if I never finish it, but it is a really great and unique puzzle game that just needs some time to get through :)"
2040,2638,brain is TOO smooth to play
2041,2638,"I have spent a stupidly large amount of time staring at text blocks that look like something Kevin from The Office would say, just to figure out the solution. 10/10"
2042,2638,Best gameplay
2043,2638,This game makes me feel very stupid. I like it a lot despite that.
2044,2638,It's like that part in the witness when it goes all meta except 3 fold

2047,2638,Brilliant puzzles
2048,2638,Mindmelting puzzle game. You will never flip flop so much between feeling like a complete idiot and a genius mastermind as in this game. If you like puzzle games there's no way around this one.

2056,2638,baba is baba and hardhead is empty
2057,2638,"This game is simply a masterpiece. It forces you to redefine your playing mindset in order to figure out how to advance. Late levels are insanely hard and solving them makes you feel reaching another level with your mind. Sometimes, I actually play this with other people, so we can freak out together trying to solve the puzzles."
2058,2638,Straight up the best puzzle game I've ever played.
2059,2638,"Very difficult, but it's fun to puzzle"
2060,2638,"amazingly original concept, well-designed outside the box puzzles, and respectable art and music.it's rare to see a ""programming"" game that's this well-designed."
2061,2638,FUN PUZZLE GAME!!!
2062,2638,"Very fun and a puzzle game you have to think about. Each level has it's own rules that you can change depending on the level. There is definitely some challenging ones to figure out, but the satisfaction of solving them is very worth it. 10/10 game, I would always recommend."
2063,2638,its cute its smart its a perfect puzzle game
2064,2638,"Baba Is You is a really interesting puzzle game, challenging but fun. The learning curve is well done, lots of puzzles can have multiple solutions and they don't get repetitive either. I believe there are about 200 or so puzzles in the game so get ready for a 40+ hrs to 100% the game unless you are a galaxy brain/looking at solutions. If you are unsure about getting it just know that I consider myself average at puzzle solving and I got my ass kicked quite a bit in the late game. Also many of the more complex levels will require you to think outside of the box to beat them otherwise get ready to get stuck a lot at first. Overall Baba Is You is one the best puzzle games out there, it's a pure puzzle game so beware there is only puzzles waiting for you but it's probably the best buy for your bucks if this is what you are looking for."
2065,2638,Baba is you is a puzzle game with a very simple premise that it uses masterfully to create incredibly interesting and difficult puzzles. Definitely the best puzzle game I have ever played so far.
2066,2638,"A fun puzzle game. (Perhaps a tad pricey though - try to get it on sale.)Basically the word blocks control how the environment behaves.E.g.""WALL IS STOP"" means the wall is solid so nothing can go through it.""FLAG IS WIN"" means that touching the flag will complete the level.To complete levels you often have to shuffle the words around to change how things behave.E.g. if you were stuck inside a box of walls and the flag was outside but you could get to the ""WALL IS STOP"" blocks you could move the words out of alignment so the walls would no longer be solid and you could then walk through them to get to the flag.It seems simple enough but the rules give rise to some very complex puzzles because your access to the words is often limited by obstacles.I'm actually surprised nobody thought of this before.It reminds me of certain esoteric programming languages that run on a 2D grid of characters."
2067,2638,Innovative puzzle game that gets quite hard.
2068,2638,awesome.
2069,2638,"Baba is You is a super unique puzzler where you must change the rules of the level in order to beat it. Sometimes the solution is fairly hidden & obtuse, but overall the game is really good.8/10"
2070,2638,"Really good puzzle game, lots of head scratchers done in a novel way"
2071,2638,baba is good
2072,2637,"I spent a good six months being pestered to get this game until, finally fed up with my refusal to buy the game, the person who was pestering me did the only rational thing and bought the game for me. At which point, I adamantly still refused to play it for like two days until I caved in and decided to actually play the game. Couldn't hurt, right?BABA IS ELEVEN /10, would bash my head into the wall over the frustration that these puzzles have caused me again."
2073,2637,fig is confuseflag is winreview is bad
2074,2637,One of the Best puzzle games ever IMO
2075,2637,Fun game until I got completely stuck.
2076,2637,Very fun puzzle game that has you make sentences so you can interact with the levels in various ways. I really liked how the early level can often be done in multiple ways while I liked less how the later levels were often linear. Also some of the rules are sometimes very vague and hard to understand like how empty works as an exemple. It was definitely worth the full price for me considering the hours I clocked.
2077,2637,baba is puzzlesolve puzzle is win
2078,2637,"Baba is You is an innovative puzzle game where the game's rules are interactable blocks, and you must manipulate the rules in order to solve the puzzles. What started as a gamejam concept is now a fully fledged game with well over 200 different puzzles.Pros:+ cutesy artstyle and soundtrack+ satisfying ""eureka!"" moments+ lots of interesting mechanics to play around with"
2079,2637,"GAME IS GREAT!If you like wasting your time on thinking resolving logic puzzles and you don't give up easily this game is for you!Firstly, simple graphics there is not a cons, it's really ok for this kind of game and the whole game is perfectly designed. It looks pretty simple, you can use just few keys, no time pressure.. but sometimes you will stay on a single level for hours and feel stupid after finding out the solution :DDifficulty is smoothly increasing, you get some simple puzzle with a new word to play first, then more and more complicated levels after, and some extra ""dot"" levels even harder. The game won't help you with the level tips, but generally they arranged the way you can already find out the solution. Also often solving one puzzle gives you an idea of the others which unblocks you and let play further. I was able to reach all Steam achievements without any clue! Often you will be stuck for days, and then suddenly wake up in the morning with the solution :P This is a game for a month at least, don't think you will finish it quickly - sometimes you will be stuck for long and also.. there are actually more levels than you expect.There is no map editor and I felt sad because if that, but after playing it for more.. it's probably not needed. There are a lot of prepared levels to do, you will have enough of puzzles to think about :P I also have an idea for many extra levels, but well.. the game is already difficult sufficiently xD.Solving every single level will award you with a great feeling, coming back to try again is worth.You will be stuck many times for sure - when you are clueless I recommend to just play around on the level, test the sentences if they are working fully the way you expect, do some random stupid stuff - you can get some ideas or find something out that way too :D And often the best is to just take a break, come back later with a fresh mind and start analyzing from the begining.Good luck!"
2080,2637,"Hardest puzzle game I've played, it really is a mind and a very original concept. I couldn't finish it 100% because I didn't want to look at solutions but my mind couldn't handle more. Seriously, it gets really really hard unless you got some creative solutions."
2081,2637,"Fantastic puzzle game; brutally difficult at times, but easy to pick up and retry any given level, and still much friendlier than something like Stephen's Sausage Roll."
2082,2637,"Prof.Vaharrak's Curator Group - Almost 30 years of gaming experience at your serviceBrilliant and charming casual puzzle game where you are Baba, a cute white 'thing' that can push objects around him in order to change the world it inhabits. A simple premise that quickly turns challenging and will require you to think out of the box often, or maybe even become the box itself!Sometimes you'll need to transform yourself into other objects, or obstacles into other objects, or switch the win condition of the level, but how? You see, when Baba pushes objects, they might spell out a phrase that modifies whatever the phrase describes. For example, you start with ""Flag is Win"", so touching the flag will lead you to victory. But maybe the flag is unreachable, and the only phrase you can make is 'Baba is Win', therefore switching the condition to your specific needs. You might even need to turn Baba into the level itself in order to accomplish your goal!With it's ever increasing level of difficulty, Baba is You is a masterclass on how to make a simple game right, one that will wring your brain for hours and will make you feel many 'big brain' moments when you conquer its many puzzles.If you enjoy deceptively simple puzzle games made with passion and a penchant for unconventional thinking, Baba is you is guaranteed to entertain you for hours on end and will feel immensely rewarding when you complete it. Very recommended!"
2083,2637,"oh wow, this is a lot of fun. I think this is my favorite twist on Sokoban. If you have even a passing interest in puzzle games, pick this one up."
2084,2637,All around great puzzle game
2085,2637,ROSE IS REDVIOLET IS BLUEGAME IS GOODBABA IS YOU
2086,2637,Awesome game. You really have to think outside of the box in some (most) levels.The idea of the game and the desgin of the levels are really clever.
2087,2637,"Simple but fun, you spend hours looking at it and being confused until you just, GET it. It's awesome, love it."
2088,2637,Beautiful. Sublime. This is the best game I've ever played.
2089,2637,"You play as a sheep in a world where you can change the rules in mind-bending ways. I usually don't like straight-up puzzle games, but I love Baba is You. Every time I play this game I feel like I get better at thinking and problem solving. The levels will get very, very tricky but if you keep at it, you will eventually beat them and feel VERY satisfied. Also, the music is amazing.  10/10"
2090,2637,"baba is you is a charming, adorable, cute little puzzle game - its blindingly hard but you feel like a genius everytime you logik your way into the incredibly statisfying solution, leaving you smashing your head into the table because it was actually so simple. Like all hard puzzle games, its hard [citation needed] so if you want a nice puzzle adventure about changing rules don't get it. Baba is you is ridiculously hard with very limited hand-holding. You might think of yourself as a puzzle genius, but I'd suggest looking up one or two puzzles in advance to glean the difficulty a bit. This might be gamer sacrilege but, seriously, I can't stress this enough, it's very, very, very, extremely, stupidly hard"
2091,2637,jhg
2092,2637,I played this game past midnight on my hall resident's switch in college last semester. Simple cute pixel art quickly becomes philosophical as you come to appreciate its intricacies. You shift around objects and words to proceed to the next level. Move rewinds makes mistakes a lot less cumbersome. This game requires thought. It's excellent to play with a gaggle of sleep-deprived college students in the common room.
2093,2637,"This is one of the best puzzle games, up there with Portal, Antichamber, and Talos Principal. If you like puzzle games you should play this."
2094,2637,Great Riddle GameU make the rules and thats why i love it tbh
2095,2637,Perfectly crafted puzzles. Perhaps the best puzzle game ever created.

2104,2637,"I love that this is a game about thinking. It's so much fun to solve the puzzles, even when they drive me crazy."
2105,2637,It's such a simple premise that you get amazed at how everything interacts and plays out with complete logic.10/10 best game i've played on steam so far.

2107,2637,"This game makes me feel stupid, and then a geniusBut I spend a lot more time feeling stupid"
2108,2637,"The most excellent and challenging puzzle game I've played in a long time! The moment when a solution ""clicks"" is undeniably satisfying, especially when that solution has taken some mulling over. Even the background music adds to the game rather than distracting focus. There's nothing about it I would change!"
2109,2637,It good
2110,2636,"Mind-twisting and hard.  24 hours into the game and maybe about half way through,  Puzzles often seem impossible until I have that ""Aha!"" moment., which feels awesome and earned.  The difficulty spikes up pretty quickly, but since I often have multiple (5+) levels available to flip back and forth between, I can always leave levels where I'm stuck for later.If you're a fan of very difficult puzzle games, pick this one up."

In all seriousness, this game is creative, beautiful, and uber addictive. If you are a fan of puzzle games, this is the Godfather."
2118,2636,"Simple, puzzling, frustrating, satisfying. The further you get into it, the more of a mindscrew it becomes."
2119,2636,Unique premise. Challenging puzzles. Consistent rules. Very fun. I usually play for short bouts until I get stumped and then come back later.

2121,2636,"If you wonder if this game is worth it, despite not having a low sales price...it absolutely is. This game will mess with your brain in ways you didn't even know it possibly could. Sometimes you'll go crazy thinking a level is unbeatable only to comeback and realize that there is a way. It's fun, creative, unique, satisfying, infuriating, and ultimately a beautiful puzzle game. Get it."

2137,2636,lava is push10/10
2138,2636,"Really creative puzzle game. When I finish a level, I always have that ""oooooooh"" moment as everything clicks into place, and the solution is usually weird enough that any novelty outweighs prior frustration. The OST is basic but pleasant, and I usually have a video on in the background anyway. Graphics are quite nice, but I think that the cleaner style seen in the promotional art would have worked better in-game than the pixel art, especially since everything is subject to a wobble effect, which can look a bit noisy with the pixels. However, that's a very minor complaint, and you can actually turn off the wobble in the settings.The difficulty can become rather extreme, and I write this review before completing the whole game because it might be months or years before I whittle it to completion.In all, very good, recommended for any fans of puzzle games."
2139,2636,Fun Puzzle game that may cause your brain to explode from time to time
2140,2636,"Don't look at me, play the game already!"
2141,2636,"One of the best puzzle games I've played. And as someone who like coding and logic puzzles, this is perfect."
2142,2636,"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Baba Is You. The game is extremely hard, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the levels will be uncompletable for a typical player's head. There's also Babas nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily from Sartrean literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these puzzles, to realize that they're not just hard- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Baba Is You truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Baba's existential catchphrase ""Baba Is You,"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Decartes French treatise Discourse on the Method  I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Arvi Teikari's genius unfolds itself on their computer screens. What fools... how I pity them.  And yes by the way, I DO have a Baba Is You tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand."
2143,2636,"The basic idea is quite simple -- it's yet another of the 10,000 or so iterations of ""push boxes around on a grid"" puzzle game. But the twist this time, that the rules of the puzzle are actually part of the puzzle itself and can be changed by pushing them around the grid, is a complete game-changer. Puzzle difficulty varies from pretty obvious to quite tricky, but all of the puzzles that I've solved so far have been genuinely fun."
2144,2636,Awsome games! but to me its rly hard
2145,2636,"Simple mechanics, hard, clever puzzles. Good game."
2146,2636,"BRAIN is HURTIt's such a mind-bending delight when you figure out a puzzle. It's made me laugh so many times at the bizarre absurdity and surprise of some of the things you can (and must) do. I've only unlocked half the areas, and I can't wait to see what the others have in store!For a game where you can change the properties of anything (and nothing), you'd think that having so much power would make every level trivial. But quite the opposite. Often you're given very little to work with, and the goal seems impossible, and then you solve it anyway because the universe is insane!It's very good."
2147,2636,Highly recommended
2148,2636,"You think you're in some unadulterated fun and have a good time solving puzzles. A few minutes pass by and you question life and how stupid you are. You'll get  so hard you go find a YouTube tutorial made by some Indian guy on how to solve 'level  9 on Island Catch The Thief'This will make you forget all of life's problems, your landlord demanding this months rent? GONE, the loving family your providing for? GONE, your general well-being? GONE. You'll spend an hour staring at a puzzle gently rocking back and forth murmuring 'Water is Win'.You lose your mind and think the puzzle has no real solution, then you have an epiphany and finally solve the puzzle, The puzzle where you've been staring at water for the last 45 minutes.10/10 would recommend seeing a health professional after playing"
2149,2636,"I love this game alot.My ""hours on record"" are not accurate, because i play this alot whilst I'm on flights, in airplane mode. Finished most of the levels, sans probably 3, and it's really, really enjoyable. Def a good time killer, and worth the price........ I mean that's really it. B.I.Y is a very simple game, and that's it's strength."
2150,2636,"SO MUCH THINKING. This is the most elaborate puzzle game I've ever played. The rules of the game itself can be changed to solve obstacles. It feels a lot like programming logic, and having plenty of experience with that I still have quite some difficulty solving some of these puzzles. That said it is a great game and solving the puzzle feels very rewarding."
2151,2636,"Yes, I recommend this game. And I love the music."
2152,2636,"""How do I make the most meta game"" is what Arvi Teikari probably asked himself at the 2017 Nordic Game Jam. He then proceeded to develop Baba Is You, a puzzle game in which the game mechanics themselves constitute the puzzle pieces. With its cute aesthetics and simple premise you might think it's a game intended for younger audiences, but you'd be mistaken. Having the power to change the game requires you to think far outside the box, and the increasing number of rules involved can quickly turn it into an intense mental exercise.The level design seems to constantly sketch new scenarios in which your previous experience with the game thus far is useless. Admittedly, this ended up making me Google the solution about 10-15 times, but in my defense, about half of those answers relied heavily on a new game mechanic that I could hardly know about. This, along with the incredibly repetitive music, is my only genuine criticism of the game.One of the most brain breaking puzzle games I've ever played, rivaled only by The Witness. 8/10"
2153,2636,"super meta, the video game of video games"
2154,2636,Great puzzles & easy to understand rules. It doesn't hurt that the soundtrack is bangin too.
2155,2636,"Talking about the game without spoiling it is hard, therefore I just recommend you playing it if you like puzzle games."
2156,2636,"I don't like that fact that on later puzzles you can push stuff that would allow you to win (e.g. level fall-2 grand stream can put together keke is key) which would allow you to solve the puzzle but when you put them together it well just block out the answer. the game is all about out thinking the game to solve the puzzle, so when you out think the game and the game does not allow it, its just not fun."

2158,2636,"Such a simple idea for puzzles and yet the applications are incredibly complex. This game really tested my lateral thinking, and yet I havent scratched the surface.

2160,2636,"Baba is You Is one of the better puzzle games that exists. The mechanics are interesting, puzzles themselves are challenging and fun, and most importantly it gives you that feeling of satisfaction when you finally understand a puzzle and solve it. I personally have spent about 15 hours on this game (if you combine the play time I have on the switch) and I thoroughly enjoy it. However be warned the puzzles get incredibly hard and can be very frustrating. I personally have not played the game in quite some time just simply because I'm stuck on literally every single puzzle that I have available.8/10"
2161,2636,GAME is GOOD
2162,2636,"The concept of a puzzle game where you have to change the rules of the level to solve it is such a unique concept and Baba Is You does it so well. I recommend this game but there's a big caveat to it. This is a not a casual game to relax with. The difficulty doesn't ramp up in a progressively more challenging way. Early levels in some worlds are more difficult to figure out than later ones that are supposed to be more challenging. You could spend 40 minutes on one level and the next two could take five minutes. The game also introduces new rules into levels and you NEED to do a lot of trial and error to learn everything you can do with that rule, and how exactly they work when you make those rules. If you can't figure out how or why certain rules are causing different effects, levels are going to take an abnormal amount of time to solve. One example with me was a level that let you make the rule  EMPTY IS YOU . It isn't clear how that rule moves because it can end up getting stuck after a while and it isn't allowed to move anymore, but before that it's totally fine.Watch some people play the game first to see just how long it can take someone to figure out the puzzles in this game. They're amazing puzzles but man can they take forever to figure out how to make progress in them. The game will give you your ""aha!"" moments but even when it does, sometimes you won't understand why what you did to solve the puzzle even worked to begin with."

2169,2635,the first 20 or so levels are extremly easy but AFTER the hammer drops. It's an awesome game...But it is really really really hard. The kind of game the you stare at the same level for hours. And i love mind games. This is something new in the genre.

Unlike other games, like The Witness, which offer enough hints and explanation and gradual increase in difficulty, this one throws you brick walls. Zero ramp up or hints. It's a very clever and original concept (change the rules of the world as you play!) muddled in poor pacing, execution, and explanation. It stops being fun when there's only one narrow, obscure solution.Original review:One of the more unusual and creative puzzle games I've ever seen. One of those games where you feel like a level is impossible and then you feel like a genius when you get it"

2203,2635,"The level design is what really makes this game special. Every level explores a unique combination of mechanics. Arvi did a great job with focusing on building exceptional puzzles. A lot of them really make you think outside the box, experiment, and just keep trying different things. When you finally solve a really difficult level, it's really satisfying. I also like that you unlock multiple levels at a time so that you can come back later to ones that happen to stump you.  I'm 70+ hours in and still working on unlocking more levels."
2204,2635,"What makes a puzzle game good?1. Original puzzle element2. Steady learning curve3. Driving force to solve puzzles1 yes2 a lil3 noOn one of the presentations the devs of Portal hosted, they said that each level should build off of the last. Essentially, you don't give people a mansion and expect them to find their way to the bathroom. There's building blocks that you have to work your way up to there.Even before portal gives you the SINGLE portal portal gun, they make you look at it through the window. At the start of the game they make you go through a portal. There is a single level dedicated to explaining that you don't have to always enter the blue portal. Even before you begin to launch yourself, there are tons of signs on the walls and floor saying that you conserve momentum. There is a crap ton of handholding.The handholding this game gives you is manifested in the level Prison. People say this is the worst level, but it is actually one of the better bits. Basically they trap you in a building with 3 statements, baba is you, keke is push and wall is stop. Because the game does not hold your hand, you could be stuck in this level for 5 hours, give up and feel stupid. But because it doesn't hold your hand, it makes the solution super satisfying. and that is where 3 comes into play.The drive Portal gives you is that you have to escape the facility, learn the lore, and hear the hilarious voicelines. Let's be real, the puzzle solving is only a fraction of the fun. In this game, you have none of that (so far, I don't think I will finish it), but the fact that the puzzles are the sole drive is quite impressive. The fact that this game got me invested for 16 hours is impressive by its self.  5 because it's a mediocre game  1 because it's original+1 because it's one of the only games I own where I don't shoot a gun. (Don't get me wrong, all of the games that score higher than this have a gun. It's just that it proves that a good game doesn't need a gun. Kind of like how Will Smith is that necessary rapper that fills the clean rap void)So for that, I'll give the game a 7/10"
2205,2635,Baba Is You is an absolutely charming brainteaser of a game that continually builds on its seemingly simple mechanics to create truly inventive puzzles that made me think creatively and feel truly accomplished after solving them.

2209,2635,"I wish I had it refunded.While the concept of using hard logic is interesting, game only generates frustration instead of fun.The learning curve is so steep you find yourself completly stuck by stage 2.There is a lot of non-logical unwritten rules, such as  if X is both YOU and DEFEAT, it removes X from the level ."
2210,2635,"Tough but fair!Being tough but fair is what many puzzle games strive to achieve. It is, of course, not easy as it requires a balance between a good challenge and a satisfying reward.This game manages to accomplish this by giving the player fun and surprising solutions after what sometimes feels like an impossible level.5/5"
2211,2635,It's cute! It's mind-bending! I have to leave and come back between every couple of levels to not get stuck and it's obviously not the flashiest game but it is such a cute way to deliver a really good puzzle system. Baba is me! :D
2212,2635,"I rarely buy games, since most of the time i spend on playing MMOs. Recently i made a few exceptions and i am glad i made this one. Game's unique quirk of playing around the rules, that are formed by puttting words into sentences in sokoban-like fashion is pretty clever. It makes you feel like you bend the laws of world and forging your own, kinda like cheating, but in a good way, because THIS is gameplay. You HAVE TO cheat on those rules to progress, to win, to not lose objective. The further you dive into game, the more complex rules become and more clever tricks you have to develop to bend environment into your favour. I have to admit that sometimes game does not comunicate well on what you can or cannot do, i can name one specific example but this would be a spoiler on puzzle that is way further into the game. However I really encourage you, dear reader, to figure out the solutions by yourself, since those inconviniences aren't that significant.Game brought me ton of fun and i haven't even figured out half the puzzles. I feel like i'm dumb or something but oh well. Youtube would break the fun of figuring out puzzles on my own :))"
2213,2635,"This is ""think outside of the box"" the game.The graphics are very simplistic but in this case it's a good thing. The music is there and while not bad, you can mute it since it adds nothing to the game. The basic gameplay concept is unique and easy to understand. That said the difficulty curve rises very quickly and the game becomes hard due to all the possible interactions between the rules and objects.It is very challenging, deceptivelly so even given its cutesy graphics. If you're not used to difficult puzzle games then this game will be unplayable for you so its best to avoid it. But for people who enjoy some tough challenges, and more specifically logic puzzles, this game is quite rewarding. I can safely recommended it!"

2223,2635,Cool and interesting puzzle game. COOL AND FUN! I recommend.
2224,2635,"Honestly, this game is recommended so much and it really demonstrates why. Unlike most puzzle games where the nature of the puzzle remains static (i.e. you are always moving toward the same goal with the same obstacles), Baba totally puts the nature of the puzzle in the player's hand. This means that the puzzle you start with is not the puzzle you end with in any level which requires a serious kind of creative problem solving which is fantastic."

2231,2635,"This is a fun little puzzle game, where you manipulate the rules of the puzzle in order to solve them. It's got cute music and simple sprites and has the same puzzle feel Portal does. But sometimes the rules are a bit illogical, which is where I find fault in the game--for example, if ""is float"" is following ""flag"", you can't touch the flag to win if you are not also floating. But if ""text is float"", then you can still push the text, even if you are not floating. Sometimes you can contradict pre-existing rules, sometimes you can't. So there's a bit of trial and error in places where there should be consistent logic--or maybe I'm just really dumb. But I'm enjoying it. It's relaxing."

2249,2634,"Baba Is You is deceptively simple, aggravatingly complex, and immensely satisfying. I haven't yet played through all the puzzles myself, and I can't even say I've enjoyed every second of gameplay when a puzzle has me stumped, but this charming little game will draw you back in again and again with its cute graphics, catchy music, and baffling logic puzzles.Baba Is You relies on manipulating simple rules to change how Baba (that's you!) interacts with the world around them, which is accomplished by literally pushing words around to create and destroy existing rules. Your goal is to reach the win condition - and I say win 'condition' because said condition changes depending on how you've changed the rules. But it's not as confusing as it sounds! If you've ever taken a logic or computer science class, you'll likely find your footing relatively quickly, but even if you haven't, it's very easy to learn. That's part of Baba Is You's charm: the gameplay and the solutions to each puzzle are simple, even if finding the solution will make you want to give up time and time again. What I particularly liked about this game is that completing one puzzle unlocks 2 to 3 other puzzles for you to work on next - which meant that if I got stuck on one puzzle, I was welcome to try the others, or go to a new area and start afresh with new rules, new music, and new puzzles. (Or, you know, turn off the game and come back later. You'll find yourself doing this if you're like me and refuse to look up walkthroughs.) The satisfaction that comes from solving a particularly head-scratching puzzle is worth the time you put in, too. Overall, if you need a game that you can open up, try a puzzle, and then close again within 5 to 10 minutes, Baba Is You will serve very well - just be ready to leave some puzzles unfinished as you go. You can always come back to them later!"

2255,2634,Game Is Great
2256,2634,"It's a fun little game, I don't suggest playing it for long periods of time as it's fairly exhausting mentally. The difficulty seems pretty inconsistent at some points and there's quite a few times where the game expects you to understand an unexplained mechanic. If you're the kind of person who likes trying everything and bashing your head against the wall into a bloody pulp it's definitely for you."
2257,2634,"A friendly block puzzle game about messing with predicate logic.  The puzzles are creative and force you to challenge your assumptions, and the undo feature gives you plenty of room to experiment.  Overall fun to play and rewarding to solve.One complaint is that the player can't attempt the levels in any order, despite the lack of a consistent difficulty progression. Since most puzzles require an ""aha"" moment, rather than incorporating lessons from previous puzzles, the level order seems arbitrary and can gate off much of the game's content if the player gets stuck on a level.  It would be more fun if the player could skip ahead to later levels."
2258,2634,"super clever, but dangerously addictive"
2259,2634,"fun, challenging, lots of thinking outside of the box to solve puzzles. I'm determined to beat every level."

2261,2634,"I really enjoyed this game. Definitely one of my favourite puzzle games.The game is a Sokoban-like where you not only push boxes but also the rules of the game, constantly changing which objects you can control, push, pull, ... The difficulty slowly ramps up throughout the game and gets really challenging towards the end.You have a lot of levels you can choose from at everytime, so if you are stuck you can try solving another level."
2262,2634,Great out of the box thinking required!
2263,2634,baba is based
2264,2634,"These are excellent puzzles where the solution is a truly fun idea and not just a lot of random work. I love the variations in ways of solving too (Though I am only about 30 puzzles through at this moment, and have heard that it may change later)And whenever you solve a puzzle it really makes you feel like a genius, so yes that's nice too. Just waiting for a level editor now!"
2265,2634,"Wow. If you like puzzle games, then this is for you. If you like being frustrated, then this is for you. But above all else, baba is you."
2266,2634,Very cool.  Really needs a programmer's mindset to get through it.
2267,2634,"Conclusion first:If you're looking for a puzzle game that requires some amount of thinking, this is a great game to pickup.However, if you don't like figuring out puzzles for yourself, then I wouldn't recommend it: you will get nothing out of this game by looking up the solutions.Keeping in mind that I'm only a few worlds (in the Mario sense) into the game, I would really recommend this to fans of puzzle games. No object in this game has qualities that aren't assigned to them somewhere on the puzzle's map, whether that be ""WALL IS STOP"", ""ROCK IS PUSH"", ""BABA IS YOU"", or any number of other combinations. Solving these puzzles requires manipulation of these rules and objects to reach an object that ""IS WIN"" with an object that ""IS YOU"".Difficulty within a world increases with each puzzle. Personally, I found the first head scratchers were the challenge puzzles at the Lake, but the first one I had to walk away from was the first challenge puzzle of the Solitary Isle. As of writing this, I haven't completed that puzzle yet.Typically you get some new words to work with in each world, with the first puzzle or two being an easier introduction, but the difficulty floor does increase for each world. For example, the first couple of puzzles in world 2 are easier than the last few in level 1 (and much easier than the challenge puzzles). Your hand is not held in the slightest; a puzzle is presented in full (nothing hidden), and you need to solve it. You can check the active rules in the menu, if you'd like, but that's all you're given.The art is simplistic. Strangely cute, IMO.The music is simple and chill. I haven't noticed if it actually changes between levels or not. I'll probably end up muting the BGM and playing different music instead. This isn't the type of game where I really care about the the sound design."
2268,2634,This game melts my head
2269,2634,"Baba is You is a game like no other. Clever; challenging; cute. Those are the three main words that come to mind when I think of it or (as so often happens) recommend it. While there isn't so much more I can say that a short first-impressions video on Youtube wouldn't better present, let me, in the following paragraphs, say why this game is worthy of your time and money.What is Baba is You? Baba is You is a puzzle game. A puzzle game that, as it's custom, consists of you clearing levels that scale in difficulty. Also, in a very Super Mario World way, there are different ""worlds"" with different themes (like, the underwater one, the space one, etc.) that add new elements and features to the mechanics of the game. And that's what this game is all about: its ""meta-mechanics""! Simply stated, the game consists of pushing blocks in order to reach a certain concealed goal. Now, what makes this new is that some of the blocks are words that refer to elements in the level itself and whose arrangements state the instructions that the elements themselves follow - one of which words being the all so important self-referential 'you'. So, for example, while usually a level begins with 'Baba is you' and 'Flag is win' as being true (and what this entails is that you, as Baba , must reach the Flag), with a few flickering and piling of blocks is possible (and actually the solution to some levels) to maintain that 'Baba is you' while also being that 'Baba is win'. Level completed.Eureka moments such as this, when you realize the way through an impermeable obstacle via simple (but deluding) changes in syntax, are what makes this piece so unique. As someone who's crazy about games that simulate this whole computer science/programming feeling (like any Zachtronics game does), I must say that Baba Is You depicts the whole idea of how instructions work like no other. Add to this the level of ingenuity the creators put into what (and how) you can modify and the cuteness embedded in all of its pixel-art and minimalistic soundtrack, and you have one of the best puzzle games of all time. I recommend this game to everyone who is into puzzles. From videogame's aficionados to complete beginners to the medium. Yes, it gets really hard (though it is not the steepest curve it has its bumps); but even if you give up halfway, there's no way you won't get a blast out of the whole experience.  (I especially recommend it to any of those brainiacs who still don't take videogames seriously; so if you know any of those,  try recommending this one yourself and see how their opinions change after just a few minutes.) All and all, a unique experience well worth many hours of whacking heads searching for that subtle, almost poetic, line of solution.  [5 stars.]"
2270,2634,So much fun!!!
2271,2634,"A game of experimentation and rewriting logical statements. Endlessly clever and deserves countless awards. When you think you've figured the game out, there is always something new presented.Do be aware this game gets ridiculously hard very fast. Many puzzles are brutally difficult which will stop some people from enjoying their time here. You will likely hit walls constantly, and feel mentally drained. But in my experience, persevering through hardship is what makes success rewarding."
2272,2634,Oh my god I feel like an idiot

2282,2634,PUZZLE IS HARDME IS DUMBGAME IS GOOD10/10
2283,2634,Baba Is Hard   IsGood
2284,2634,"This game made me feel so stupid that my brain melted into a puddle of primordial goop on the floor, Overall it's a 10/10."
2285,2634,"Cute, fun, and engaging."
2286,2634,baba
2287,2634,Fun game with innovative mechanics
2288,2634,"After the first easy puzzles, I felt smart.After staring at the screen for 30 mins, not able to solve the next puzzle, I felt stupid.After another 15 mins I solved it, I felt really smart.After thinking ""who came up with this?"", I felt pretty stupid again.Baba is win."
2289,2634,Like it
2290,2634,"Barely started the game, but I already love the concept"
2291,2634,Fun little puzzle game with a well executed semantic mechanic.
2292,2634,"Nice Game, but it gets hard really quick!"
2293,2634,Never has a game made me go from feeling so smart to feeling so stupid so fast.
2294,2634,"Awesome game with very simple mechanics. I've only played about 2 hours and I've been stuck a couple of times. Stuck in a good way. It forces me to really think about the puzzle. Beautiful concept, beautiful game."
2295,2634,Neat puzzle game that requires quite a bit of creative and lateral thinking. Relying on intuitions will seldom help.
2296,2634,Text is Baba
2297,2634,Surprisingly great puzzle game for its replayability due to enormous amount of puzzles. Don't hesitate to try it and get spoilers on youtube if you get stuck - it's still a lot of fun to redo all of that from memory :) did that 5 times already.
2298,2634,"Awesome game. Really makes you think outside the box. Every island starts with some new feature and some levels to understand them, until it brings everything you learned back together.If you enjoy puzzles and challenges, this is a game you must play."
2299,2634,Makes my head hurt from thinking too hard. I like it.
2300,2634,"It's actually just so fun and addictive! And a bit zen too, in an infuriating way - it teaches you patience, and how a challenge that seems impossible one day can be solved in 5 minutes the next. SO FUN!!!!!"
2301,2634,"Amazing! Don't be put off by the price tag given the graphics. This game is seriously clever, and unique. Loving it. Would love more of this kind of thing"
2302,2634,I don't know why I paid thousands of dollars to go to college and feel stupid when I could have just bought this game
2303,2634,"this game is really, really good.that's all i have to say, it's just amazing."
2304,2634,"Creative thinking, well worth it."
2305,2634,Baba is hard T_T
2306,2634,This game makes me feel like a total moron. I love it.
2307,2634,"An incredibly original and fun puzzle game. No pressure, no time constraints and no getting misled by graphics. Baba is you provides a serious of obvious and still obtuse brain teasers for many hours of entertainment."
2308,2634,Makes you feel like you have fewer brain cells than fingers.
2309,2634,"This game is seriously good. The first time I got in touch with the concept of this game was on a minigame on a Minecraft Classic server. I didn't know about Baba Is You at the time, so I thought it was only the minigame I played. About a year later I saw a Twitch streamer I watch quite often stream this game and I decided to watch and it looked very familiar to me, of course. That's when I realised that the minigame I played was based off of this game. I was very happy to say the least to find this game is available on Steam and I have not looked back since.I'm personally not a big fan of puzzle games but just like the Portal series, this is a must have game."
2310,2634,"A simple puzzle game that can be from super easy to unbelievably clever. For anyone who love puzzle game, this is the one you need to buy"
2311,2634,ME IS BABA.....................|................IS.........................|.............YOU LIKE BABA.|....................................IS.....|..................................WIN..|_______________|WALL IS STOP
2312,2634,"Baba is You. Baba is Win.Highly addictive from the start! Also, a good way to teach children how to break some rules. Music is nice and graphics are simple and appealing to a 8-bit lover. Two thumbs up and a solid recommendation for anyone wanting to kill time and improve their out-of-the-box-thinking while doing it."
2313,2634,I ENJOY THE PROBLEM SOLVING CHALLENGES AND THE CREATIVITY REQUIRED.  I WISH I COULD USE THE MOUSE OR PAD ON THE COMPUTER TO MOVE BABA... A PLUS OF ARROWS IN A CORNER WOULD DO.
2314,2634,"If ""Brain"" = On:return ""Good game""if ""Brain"" = Off:return ""I wanna die"""
2315,2634,At first I thought the game title was just poorly translated. Then I played it and I was like ooooh Baba IS you!Now it makes sense.
2316,2634,The trailer is pretty much exactly what you get.  Level after level of the most mind bending puzzles.  All of them perfectly straight forward.  Perfectly logical.  Each puzzle is contained in a single screen.  There are nearly 200 levels in the game.  Some of these levels will take hours and hours to finish.  Get ready to punch yourself for spending hours on what was actually a ridiculously simple level.  Then do it again and again and again.
2317,2634,Brain melter. Excellent design.
2318,2634,"A simple game, And yet.."
2319,2634,"This is the kind of game you can get lost in. The only advice I would have liked earlier is that you can undo single moves with the Z key on your keyboard, rather than having to completely reset a level.Other than that... It's a puzzle game. Either you're here to logic your way out of the maze, or you're not going to enjoy the game. If the latter is true, look up the soundtrack on YouTube and consider buying that anyhow, the composer behind this little gem did fantastic work. Even in the case that you're not all that into puzzles... you might consider looking up a guide for levels you're having trouble with, so you can get to levels that you might understand better.There's no shame in asking for help, so long as you're enjoying yourself, and I most certainly have been.Tons of levels, enough so that it's going to take me days to finish the whole thing. Well worth the price!"
2320,2634,"I have only played for 50ish minutes at the time of writing, but I already love it so much.It has such a simple concept of ""what is this object's property?"" as a puzzle, but the puzzles can be so maddening for my 20iq brainThen I return to the game after a few hours, suddenly the same maddening puzzle is super easy and I'm left to wonder how did I not see the solution at all.It's a really, really lovely puzzle game."
2321,2634,This game made me realize how much i absolutely suck at puzzle games.One of the most innovative and clever puzzle games i've ever played.
2322,2634,apology for poor englishwhere were you when baba diesi was sat at home pushing word when sentence formed'baba is kill''no'
2323,2634,GA  I  GOME S  OD
2324,2634,"As the developer himself says, he might not be able to make another game as successful as Baba Is You,which is a bitter sweet situation for any game developer.However this sure is the level where Baba Is You is at.Hands down best puzzle game, maybe best game in 2019.Now in 2020, haven't seen another that rivals this masterpiece.I got the game as soon as it came out, it did not disappoint at all, and it blew my mind so many times.And now I can't wait for more content with the level editor.As a puzzle game lover, this one is already in the Hall Of Fame."
2325,2634,"I don't usually go for puzzle games but this is the best puzzle game I've ever played. The thought process that goes into solving each level feels similar to how I think while programming. Really, really well done."
2326,2634,Genious gameplay that really makes you think in unconventional ways. I've just started playing today and I am hooked. I knew the game for a while since it was recommended to me at university. And I really wasn't dissapointed.If someone likes puzzle games he will have fun with Baba Is you.
2327,2634,"I recommend Baba Is You simply because there isn't any other game like it. It is difficult, too difficult in many places (I used a walkthrough for like 2/3rds of the game). But it is so unique, and the puzzles that you manage to solve on your own make you feel like a genius."
2328,2634,"Fantastic puzzle game, im not that into puzzle games but this one is special. It feels super rewarding figuring out what to do and beating a level, especially after thinking for 10 minutes straight. Amazing its definitely worth a try."
2329,2634,15 minutes in game and I already love it.
2330,2634,Ooohh baby what a wonderful puzzle game and a great puzzle game no 1 rule will stay the same throughout the entire game I definitely recommend
2331,2633,Great puzzle game. Its very challenging and also very fun. The artwork is cute and amazing. The levels are well thought and smartly thought of.The gameplay is amazing and the controls are clean. While playing this i had to search the answers a lot while i was stuck on some levels. Its always cool to find new ways to win the level.Great game i recommend to people who want a challenge.
2332,2633,"I have been stuck on ??? level 6, Parade, for months. I refuse to look up hints. At night I dream of changing Me into Keke into Skull, in  way that will not make Baba stop being me. I have not bathed and stopped going to work. I've been kicked out of my apartment, and my wife left me. I will solve this. 10/10"
2333,2633,"Not a review, just a recommendation"

2340,2633,"This game will warp your brain in ways you could have never imagined. It is addicting and rewarding to play. At the same time, there will be moments when you hate this game for making you look or feel stupid. It isn't easy, but it is worth a purchase for anyone who likes a good puzzle."
2341,2633,BABA IS [TURING COMPLETE]
2342,2633,"Very difficult, but it is so satisfying to solve the puzzles. Definitely worth the money."
2343,2633,good
2344,2633,Very fun puzzle game.  Makes you think in all different ways due to it's custom editable rule set defined by objects in the levels
2345,2633,Made my brain melt. 10/10
2346,2633,"Thinking outside the box taken to the extreme. An outstanding puzzle game that gets very, very difficult."
2347,2633,"Yeah, rules are meant to be broken and bent in this little gem.  Easy at first - Baba is you, but later .. are you baba or is baba something else? Who knows.."
2348,2633,", my brain hurts..."
2349,2633,Creative puzzle game that can melt your brain and leave you feeling smart for figuring it out.

2352,2633,I haven't felt this stupid in years.
2353,2633,BABA IS GREAT
2354,2633,this game is pog. go play it
2355,2633,The perfect puzzle game.
2356,2633,Very good puzzle game but you have to have a very high-IQ to play
2357,2633,after a while you stop playing as baba :(
2358,2632,Big fun would play
2359,2632,so smart
2360,2632,Baba is Awesome
2361,2632,Good times. You can be a sheep or a wall.
2362,2632,"My god is it a brain. Masterpiece of a puzzle game with so many cool puzzles,  hell, even levels inside of levels,  although beware, this game might be beyond your comprehension."
2363,2632,baba is good
2364,2632,"It's a fun game in the beginning, but it is soo hard that it becomes really frustrating and you get stuck on every level.It really forces you to think out of the box, which is kind of cool - but if you don't, you have no chance."
2365,2632,Never played something similar in the past. Although I don't know whether it is really so desirable that my neural networks have now spun around in my brain. This way of thinking brings you nothing in life except.. damn fun!
2366,2632,Very challenging and very adorable
2367,2632,"The game has extremely pleasing sound and audio design, an extremely cute art style and it feels satisfying to beat each and every level (similarly to the Portal games). The only downside is that the game is almost impossible to beat without a walkthrough for individuals with an average IQ of 90."
2368,2632,Very unique and addictive puzzler that really makes you go HMMMMMMMMMM. Highly recommend.
2369,2632,An enjoyable but massively difficult puzzle game whose main negative is that you might run out of stages you can reasonably solve on your own in a few hours.  Still fun to go through with a walkthrough to see how clever the solutions are.
2370,2632,intensely good retro-styled puzzle game that lays a lot of foundations for programming and math!
2371,2632,Great idea for a puzzle game. Clever puzzles so far. Makes my brain hurt.
2372,2632,a rather unique and fun puzzle game
2373,2632,Really just a frustrating game all around. The jittering graphics and repetitive music are very annoying.
2374,2632,Awesome
2375,2632,Hardest puzzle game I've ever played... 79 hours of gameplay and I'm finally finished! 10/10 love it
2376,2632,This twisted sokoban is too hard.
2377,2632,creeper
2378,2632,worth it
2379,2632,This is the best puzzle game. It ruins all other puzzle games.
2380,2632,"This game is ridiculously awesome. You are required to think out of the box the whole time. But the most insane thing is all the ways the developer came up to introduce new game mechanics. Im not that much into puzzle games, but this one just keeps on giving."
2381,2631,"Wait a sec, gotta use 110% of my brain for this one... There we are. So, yeah, I would recommend this game-- WHAT IS THIS LEVEL?!"
2382,2631,"I'm So Meta, Even This Acronym : the game"
2383,2631,"The most addictive and amusing little game I have played in a long time, makes me recall things like Manic Miner from years ago, and more recently Braid, but no lightning reflexes needed (at least so far...), just lateral thinking!Update: this game is a work o genius, and extremely good value considering how man hours of entertainment it contains. Could be the game of the decade!Great brain training for the more mature player, but fun for all ages."
2384,2631,Clever game. Challenging puzzles game.
2385,2631,"It's one of those puzzle games that are so hard, that you need to come back to it again and again to be able to get through everything.  You can't do the whole thing in one sitting."
2386,2631,An example that any mechanic can meake a great game if done well
2387,2631,It is a very fun puzzle-solving game that challenges you to think outside the box in order to solve the various problems presented.
2388,2631,Baba is kicking my ass
2389,2631,my brain hurts but it's so worth it
2390,2631,Interesting puzzle game.

2395,2631,I bet this game is really good but I can't get past the second area. buy only if your brain is huge
2396,2630,"Baba Is You is challenging, inventive, and endlessly clever with its impeccable design and overall aesthetic. I love this game, and would highly recommend it to anyone wanting a challenging task to work away on during a free afternoon. My only warning is that some of the levels are really hard, so frustration could be imminent for some."
2397,2630,gamer gamer
2398,2630,Brilliant! Every level is extremely satisfying to solve!
2399,2630,Baba is YouGame is Good and Hard
2400,2630,Baba is youtrex is happy
2401,2630,"Baba is You is one of the best puzzle games I played in my life. It's hard at times, but not in a way that makes you hate the game (for example if it didn't have the option to rewind, you'd have to restart some levels over and over because of a tiny mistake). Even when levels are easy, the solutions are still pretty original and fun.100% Recommended. I had been waiting for this to go on discount for a while, but ended up buying it at full price and I don't regret it. Totally worth my money.If you get really stuck, I recommend you to google ""Baba is Hint"", it's a guide with hints meaning to help you get unstuck without actually spoiling the actual solutions. So you still have to think."
2402,2630,"This is currently my favorite puzzle game, possibly of all time. The mechanics are very unique and make a certain weird kind of sense after you have played it for a while. The first few puzzles are fairly easy and then the game rapidly gets extremely difficult, but solving that one puzzle you have been stuck on for hours (or days) is always so satisfying.A handful of the levels have a very specific solution that sometimes feels like it shouldn't work quite the way it does, but mostly the solutions are the sort of 'well duh, why didn't I see that earlier' sort of thing that you come to after thinking about it for a while.Baba is Love."
2403,2630,It's a noice puzzle game. Don't know much else to say. 9.5/10
2404,2630,"This game's puzzle mechanics are unique, but requires some intense thinking. However, the game is fair and does not give trick solutions to the problem. For a fun puzzle experience, I would certainly recommend it."
2405,2630,"Great game for people with a PhD in philosophy.If you do not have a PhD then do NOT buy this game. If you haven't spent hours upon hours researching dense academic material you won't be able to complete the first couple of levels. Without reading all of George Berkeley's works, how can you even begin to understand statements like ""Lava is more and hot"" coupled with mindblasters like ""Flag is melt and win"" and ""Baba is hot"". Esse is percipi (or for those monkeys that don't know basic Latin: to be is to be perceived) is crucial for at least a dozen levels of ""Baba Is You"". If you don't have a wide understanding of all the different philosophical schools of thought don't even bother reading the rest of this review. Nihilism is especially ingrained in the game's mechanics which is even evident in the likeness of the name ""Baba Is You"" to the Friedrich Nietzsche's famous line ""God is dead"". The ingenious ways that logical premises can be constructed and deconstructed only reassure the players that space, time and causation are mere sensibilities. After reading this you might still think you might give it a shot but didn't you learn in high school that things in themselves exist but their nature is unknowable? I smirk at those addlepated simpletons that bought this game without understanding the hermeneutic circle, struggling to apply knowledge from previous levels in the reference to the game as a whole. Without a PhD how would you even analyse this game from a meta perspective? Not in a million years would you think of realising this game is actually a beautiful existentialist work on par with works of Sartre, Kafka or Camus. Every level is a journey and at the end of each is a profound tautology.Bravo Arvi Teikari, Bravo! I hope I will get to test my beliefs through one of your games again."
2406,2630,its good if you have a lot of time in your hands
2407,2630,"Definitely one of the most interesting twists I have seen on a puzzle game. Moving the words around to change the rules in which you interact with the levels is such an engaging and fun concept. A lot of the puzzles will be real be real brain busters, but there is an immense sense of satisfaction upon completing each segment.  I love it when I get that big EUREKA! moment and everything thing else in the puzzle starts making more sense in context. If you're looking for a puzzle game that both makes you feel like an idiot and a genius at the same time then I definitely recommend this."
2408,2630,A very good and genius puzzle game.
2409,2630,Together with Talos Principle best puzzle game ever. I spent 100+ hours with it and was amazed by neverending flow of new principles and good ideas. Solutions are rarely repeated.Plus the graphics is cute and the music did not annoy me even after 100 hours.The only thing that annoyed me is the navigation on the map in the final stages where you control more objects than just the cursor.
2410,2630,"good puzzle gaem, make think yes"
2411,2630,s
2412,2630,"Baba is You offers an interesting take on the puzzle genre. In essence, it is a combination of Sokoban and programming. While the programming portion of manipulating the rules already gives it infinite potential to make any puzzle, the Sokuban aspect contextualizes the puzzles to make them less abstract (even then Baba is You is an extremely abstract game). This freedom of the mechanics allows for really wild setups that can be made, giving the player many tools (tools in the sense of ideas, and not an in-game gameplay ability) at their disposal. Many levels thought the whole game is designed around figuring out those tools. On the other side, those tools are later reused in tandem with other ideas to create more and more complex levels. Those would be the majority of the levels in-game, even though most players would find themselves taking more time on the former set of levels. Till the very end of the game, new rules are getting added, which adds more and more that can be learned. This isn't to say that the game just plays on a new gimmick for every level to keep the attention of the player - it thoroughly explores each and every mechanic it present to the player. The game is very long and it can feel like it has already exhausted what it can teach you by the end, even though by the very nature of the mechanics this is impossible. While the game offers extremely interesting puzzles and mechanics, it still suffers several issues. It has somewhat inconsistent difficulty, which gets worse the deeper you get in the game (in a sense this is close to unavoidable to an extent considering how abstract the puzzles get later on). A good amount of the levels that are about learning a new trick could be very abstruse to figure out in the most later zones. Also, the last zone reuses many ideas of the first zones, however, by that point in the game, the player might have forgotten some of the less used ideas - I found myself having to replay the game twice to be able to beat the full game due to this. It would have been nice to have a refresher to those ideas somewhere so that the player should not figure them out again but in a more complex scenario. The game is still amazing, even if the last areas are not paced as good as the rest of the game (they still offer some of the best puzzles in the game). The game is also going to get an official level editor in the future and with the nature of the mechanics, it has amazing potential for community levels."
2413,2630,"brain is smallbaba is too hard for my smal peanut,,,,"
2414,2630,"A nice little game to train your ability to bend your brain to think outside of the box (sometimes literally!). I am still missing a secret or two, but I think I have a pretty good idea where to find them...It's a bit odd that some say that this game gets too difficult too fast, and that levels later in the game are obscure and basically impossible without a guide because they require arcane incantations of precise button inputs with no way to know what works and when.They really are not that obscure, and most of the levels either have a new trick they guide you to find and are otherwise short, or have a logical progression to them, allowing incremental and progressive solving with a clear goal and a high-level strategy with steps that are achievable from the previous step with a few moves with clear direction and purpose. This is the exact opposite of the supposedly obscure, opaque, intractable complexity some claim the game to suffer from.A great game, overall. Hopefully, I end up finding that there is yet another layer to it that I have not found yet. I just do not want it to end...Edit: Completed the game. The very last secret was not really that difficult to find, but I kept missing it. A great game, but now All is Done and I want more..."
2415,2630,"Hello, I had a lot of fun while playing. It's a good game. Best ActionShooter I ever played."
2416,2630,I love the way this game changes the way you think. Some of the levels seem super hard at first but turn out really easy in the end and vice versa. The style is adorable and the sound effects really enrich the whole thing. Highly recommended!
2417,2630,"deilishly tricky conceptual puzzler, price well reasonable given the volume of content. comparable to a full book of mixed difficulty sudoku."
2418,2629,Hard but rewarding
2419,2629,"Lovely puzzle game putting a very creative and refreshing take on block pushing. Solidly designed levels, often with solutions more so necessitating lateral thinking than exacting manoeuvres. Offers a fairly serious challenge, and doesn't overstay it's welcome. It's also worth stating that the game does a good job at introducing mechanics without bogging you down with excessive tutorials.If you're not put off by every so often clearing a level and going ""was I meant to do that?"", this is highly recommended."
2420,2629,"BABA. IS. GOOD. AND. PUZZLE. GAME.BABA IS YOU is a simple yet genius puzzle game, featuring the sheep? Baba as he pushes blocks to create simple sentences to give properties to items and uses them to solve puzzles and explore a vast selection of levels. It's such a simple concept but it works so well for a puzzle game.Gameplay in BABA IS YOU has a lot of moving block to create phrases in order to give the objects in a level a certain function or property. For Example, the phrase BABA IS YOU gives the control of BABA to you so you can move him around and FLAG IS WIN make the Flag object the key to solve the puzzle and you can mix and match all the words at your hearts content. The gameplay is so simple but provides pretty much limitless ideas for puzzles and many of these honestly stumped me from time to time. Baba also has plenty of puzzles to keep you busy with themed worlds and even some secret areas but shhh....The artstyle and overall theming of BABA IS YOU is one of the most memorable part about the game as the simple pixel art graphics along with the calm and atmospheric music in each of the levels makes for such a interesting experience while trying to figure out the many puzzles the game has.Lastly, I have seen potential for a Level Editor which I think would be a amazing idea as it has the potential to have people create their own puzzles and give the game a big boost in replayability. I am aware that there is a somewhat functional way to get a level editor running, but not in a way to make it easily accessible to the public. Overall, BABA IS YOU is a solid puzzle game featuring a simple idea that is uses in many different ways to create some of the most interesting puzzles I've seen in a while, it always had something new up it's sleeve to feature in the next puzzle I played. The only negative I Have other than the sheer difficult from some of the puzzles, is that the game is kinda pricey, being about 15$ which I honestly think is a bit too much but at least it is possible to get it on sale.REVIEW. IS. END."

2437,2629,Oh lordy this game breaks my brain. Certain puzzles can be incredibly frustrating and obtuse but overall the game provides very nice and interesting puzzles for you to think through.
2438,2629,"A creative puzzle game about making your own rules, baba is you is a great game that many people can enjoy, whether you want to beat everything or just get the standard ending."
2439,2629,Unique mechanic
2440,2629,"WOW. This is a fantastic puzzle game. It really lives up to its overwhelmingly positive rating. The game does a good job at letting you move past challenging levels and come back when you're ready. I'm roughly 40 hours in and am still slowly working my way through this one.Definitely buy if its not on sale, and absolutely buy if its on sale."
2441,2629,"I'm stuck, but I'm not giving up!"
2442,2629,"Amazing. A simple idea, incredible execution, yielding a truly unique, brilliant gem."
2443,2628,one of the most interesting puzzle games i've played
2444,2628,This game is great.
2445,2628,I just completed this game....What can I say?Best puzzle game EVER. Mind breaking from the beginning and really challenging. I highly recommend this masterpiece!
2446,2628,The rules change according to what you do!
2447,2628,Sometimes when I can't sleep I think of Baba. Still can't sleep but other Puzzle Games usually don't pop up in my head in the middle of the night so yeah. Night has Baba
2448,2628,my brain is melting and if a puzzle game does that it's a good puzzle game
2449,2628,"Insanely clever puzzle game. Every level blows my mind. Adorable art with nice simple animation and good music too. This is the best simple puzzle game I've ever seen. It can get so, so hard though."
2450,2628,innovative and fun puzzle game
2451,2628,Some of the best puzzles out there
2452,2628,Really cool puzzle game. The puzzles get really hard too in the later levels. Enough that I can work on them for hours before I solve them!
2453,2628,dont buy if ur brain is tiny
2454,2628,"The game has some incredible mind- going on. A great puzzle game that doesn't require doing the same exact thing for a whole day, despite quite simple mechanics. 7/10, if you can be my KEKE, I will be your BABA."
2455,2628,Baba is me but baba is not not me and not baba isn't me but baba is me
2456,2628,"A masterpiece.Baba is You is the only game I've played that tests the player's ability to ~conceptualise~. Even when the solution is simple technically, no matter how long you mess around in the level, you won't come across the solution by randomly messing around -- your brain will be completely blind to some of the possibilities unless you actively imagine them. A lot, if not most, of the puzzles have multiple solutions, too! I can't wait for the level editor to come out. Definitely my game of the year, and a strong contender for my favourite game of all time."
2457,2628,"Great puzzle game, tough as nails and most people won't finish it completely, but it's very addictive and satisfying when you get levels solved!Very much recommended!"
2458,2628,I like the game despite that some levels make me feel stupid.
2459,2628,Just look at my playtime guys just look at my playtime. Do not stop looking at my playtime. Why is my playtime this high? Is it because I am extremely insecure and feel like I need to prove something by 100%ing this game. Or is it because this game is genuinely adorable and clever and fun and other adjectives. I'll let you decide.
2460,2628,.
2461,2628,Zoc is gaming. Gaming is fun. Baba is good.
2462,2628,"I'll say this right here and now - Baba Is You is the spiritual successor to PortalBoth of the games have a single, very specific system with a few overarching rules. Like the best of any kind of system, they're broad enough that their interactions create countless unique interactions, and the potential to pull out some crazy solutions to the problems presented to the player. The best kind of puzzle game rewards clever thinking, going outside the box and using your understanding of the system's interactions to circumvent seemingly impossible situations, and both allow for solutions outside what the developer intended. Both games have that powerful 'click' of ecstasy when you figure out how to win the room you're in, and it slowly builds on itself as you get further in, forcing you to employ earlier techniques in more outlandish ways as you're forced into more diabolical puzzles. This isn't a game for smart people, necessarily. It's a game for people who are -clever-.One of the most important parts of Baba Is You, that Portal also excelled at, was teaching you how to play the game without bashing you over the head with it. It starts off with basic concepts, obviously enough, but rather than having a big tutorial saying NOW WHY DON'T YOU TRY THIS, it presents the early puzzles in ways that slowly build up the player's understanding of various techniques and tricks they can use, leading into the next puzzle in a perfectly organic learning curve that even the best of games utterly fail at. Baba Is You encourages players to break away from the old habits and concepts that they've had built into them after playing video games for so long. Walls are not just barriers any more, they're just as much a tool as a rock or a key is, and the faster you free yourself of your preconceived notions on what something is, the quicker you'll acclimate to this game.While it doesn't have Portal's quirky dialogue or humor, the simple-but-not-lazy style serves to reinforce the stark simplicity Baba Is You revels in. It looks and feels like a nursery rhyme version of the old Chip's Challenge. The music, admittedly, does get tiresome after listening to it on loop while staring at a particularly troublesome mindbender, though it seems designed to be as non-intrusive as background music can get.I really can't stress how inventive and clever such an innocent seeming package can be. Baba Is You stands head and shoulders above other puzzle games in terms of ingenuity and proving that fresh concepts can still be found. Baba Is You will undoubtedly stand the test of time as a modern classic, showing off how less can be considerably more, and reinventing how people think of puzzles for ages to come, much like Portal did back when it crashed onto the scene."
2463,2628,The perfect puzzle game
2464,2628,"Puzzle games aren't usually able to hold my attention for this long, but the clever puzzles and creative mechanics have me constantly coming back for more."
2465,2628,Me and my friends argued with eachother on a level that we were thinking way too hard about. We ended up completing the level and settled on calling eachother gay and retarded.
2466,2627,"Baba Is You is the best video game of all time that I never played myself. I just couldn't progress after a point, because it becomes incredibly difficult and somewhat tedious. Maybe you could criticize the game for that in some way, but honestly, it doesn't really matter. I started watching someone else play this game on youtube and tried to solve the puzzles together with that person, sometimes skipped certain parts, and that way I still kinda ""played"" it. It certainly helped that the person playing was very entertaining. Anyway, this way I saw everything this game has to offer and found out about all the insane, creative, cool and mind blowing things that happen later in the game. At some point there was one ""Aha!"" moment after the other. This is pure video game magic."
2467,2627,"If you like this game, you might be good at programming. Things can be very unexpected, but it will always make sense within the rules of the game. Did you move the words Wall Is Stop? Well, maybe now you can walk through walls."
2468,2627,"This is one of my favourite games. It's incredibly fun and challenging, and a very original concept - I don't know any other game like this. 100% recommend it!"
2469,2627,Baba is You is an simple and thought provoking game that everyone should attempt. It's a puzzle that forces players to change their perspective and process each challenge in an expansive way.
2470,2627,In soviet russia block pushes you.
2471,2627,"A very clever and elegantly designed minimalistic puzzle game. You may easily find yourself spending half an hour staring at a level that stumps you, only to realise what the solution is and execute it in less than a minute. It offers dozens of levels divided into zones, of which you only need to complete a handful to advance to the next zone. This helps keep the game fresh and gives you new stuff to look at when/if you need a break from a puzzle that isn't clicking with you. This may be beneficial to you as some levels will require you to use interactions you may not have known existed before, and some levels make them more intuitive to figure out than others. Zones are themed and provide a nice bit of visual cohesion without going as far as to imply a story or a narrative, which makes the game pretty easy to drop and return to at any time.Despite how difficult the game can get only a couple of zones in, I do not feel intimidated when I return to it and can confidently recommend it to anyone who enjoys a puzzler that encourages you to think systematically but also outside of the box at the same time."

2482,2627,Oof
2483,2627,Puzzle games are supposed to make you feel smart. This one just makes me feel like an idiot.
2484,2627,Its honestly the best puzzle game I have ever played.

2486,2627,If there are any mind readers near my house I feel bad for them because the thoughts they pick up from me while I play this game must be completely incomprehensible without context.
2487,2627,BABA IS YOU AND GOOD
2488,2627,"Challenging, novel, cute, and funny. Makes you have to think unconventionally. The easy levels are still interesting, the hard levels break your brain until something clicks, and then they're tremendously satisfying."

2492,2627,"Single greatest puzzle game I have ever played, very challenging yet not necessarily difficult; if you're stuck chances are it's because you need to change the way you look at the problem, or think about how the mechanics work. If you have ever enjoyed a puzzle, this game should be a top priority."
2493,2627,"This game is as hard as it is brilliant. If you think you'll like it then you probably will! Same as any puzzle game, if it's too difficult you can just look up the answers."

2498,2626,Baba is good
2499,2626,"Adorable, relaxing; the music and sound design is amazing and the puzzles are simple but challenging. A must-play for anyone who likes puzzles."
2500,2626,"If baba is you, and keke is me...Then who is phone?"
2501,2626,"If you're a fan of games by Zachtronics or ""Zach-likes"", you'll really like Baba is You. It is easily among my favorite puzzle games along with Exapunks, Fez, and the Talos Principle. Often the levels appear impossible... until they don't. The burst of insight when everything falls into place is incredibly satisfying and probably why I like this game so much. Don't let the price or graphics dissuade you.Some of the levels are very hard without hints, but I recommend not using any, just leave it and come back later. The discovery process is the most rewarding part of the game, and you only have to beat about a third of the levels to progress, so there's no reason to bash your head against the wall just to complete things (at least, more than you need and/or want to)."
2502,2626,"I feel like I'm at work debugging code. 10/10.But seriously this game is one of the most unique and creative puzzle games I've played in years. I remember playing Portal and discovering that you can launch yourself by vertically aligning two portals, start to fall infinitely, then placing another portal on the ground.Baba is You is filled with those ""aha"" moments where you discover a game mechanic that you weren't aware was even possible.Some examples are:- Entering a locked room by becoming the walls.- Declaring your existence as the win condition.- Drowning the lose condition in the water."
2503,2626,The gameplay are very simple...very easy to learn and everything looks easy...But... the puzzles are so challenging!! which it is good...helps you think outside the box...sometime the easiest level becomes hard because your mind already set that the level were going to he difficult..If you like puzzle games you should give this a try!
2504,2626,"Very original premise. Puzzles are very original, unlike anything I've seen in other games, and require lateral thinking. Lots of content; after 20 hours I've completed 112 levels but there's still a lot left. You can ""win"" the game with a lot less than that though; most of the content, especially the really hard puzzles, is optional. Levels get progressively harder at a good pace."

2506,2626,"Quick Breakdown: One of the most unique and brain bending puzzle games Ive ever played.Genre: PuzzleScore: 8/10Review Date: 2020-05-05Full Review: Baba Is You is an incredibly unique and interesting puzzle game that makes you think outside the box. Or maybe you are the box. Box Is You? Its the most brain warping mind  since Antichamber. And much like Antichamber forced you to think differently to progress and did something totally new, so does Baba Is You, though it goes about things with a very different method to its madness. You play as the titular Baba in which you push around text tiles to rewrite the rules to the game a you play. I really dont want to say too much about how the mechanics work as part of the charm is discovering things, so I will be deliberately vague.The game does a very good job of introducing new mechanics in a way that neither spoon feeds you the how-to nor are they overly obtuse. After a new mechanic is introduced the next few levels will make you throw your thinking as far outside the box as possible to figure out the solution. Suffice it to say rarely has a game thats managed to make me feel so smart and so stupid at the same time once I figure out the solution to a level.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2046540923The game is divided in to worlds filled with a number of levels. You have some freedom in choosing what levels to complete as the map branches some and youre not required to complete all levels in a world to progress. This is a good thing as some levels are tough as hell to figure out. By allowing a bit of freedom in level selection it helps prevent one from getting frustrated if theyre stuck on a level, allowing them to try their hand at another and return at a later time for another crack at things.As of this writing Ive logged a little over 18 hours in the game and Ive completed around 40% of the levels. I intend to keep playing the game and hopefully knock out some more levels, but Ill be honest, Im not sure that Im smart enough to actually get all of them. That said, Ive enjoyed every minute Baba so far and it was well worth the purchase and playtime even if Im not able to progress further.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2047566893 If you at all enjoy puzzle games absolutely buy Baba Is You. Its so creative and innovative and when youre done youll turn into Brain Is Fried."
2507,2626,"One of the most innovative, complex, and challenging puzzle games I have ever played."
2508,2626,"Amazing game, very good idea and well made execution! My only complaint is about the little inconsistency in the behavior of ""SHIFT"" objects that cannot push thing A onto thing B despite thing B itself not being either push or pull, well, it's hard to explain, but it breaks the logic a little bit for me, but still, it is awesome and a great mind bender! :)"

2512,2626,Brilliant puzzle game with a plethora of levels. Excellent value.
2513,2626,"Awesome game, never been that addicted to a puzzle game. Used to be a Dark Souls player, and this thing is also very hard!"
2514,2626,"Other reviews have said this far better than I can. This game throws new mechanics at you and expects you to know them right off the bat. Which sucks because the first levels of this game had me hooked only to be met with disappointment. On top of all that, this game is so visually unappealing. Along with the sound design and music being virtually pointless considering how lazy they are. My biggest problem with the game is the initial draw of being able to find creative solutions by manipulating the pieces, only to discover that all of the puzzles require one or two very specific solutions rather than you're own out of the box discovery. I don't know why this game got so much praise. Buy it if you want to not have fun for hours and feel mild satisfaction for a few seconds every time you solve a puzzle."
2515,2626,very nice logic game.
2516,2626,it is very hard but a lot of fun
2517,2626,"It's a stellar example of how the puzzle genre can innovate. The mechanics are simple- there are only a few truly ironclad rules, with the rest of the games rules unfolding, changing, and being destroyed as you play. Despite the incredible amount of rules, most mechanics are learned in a natural exploratory way,as the game itself is played with only two buttons and a d-pad. Although the ""I didn't know you could do that"" puzzle does rear it's ugly head occasionally, the large majority of solutions arise as a natural result of the core rules. Also, this game is incredibly hard to 100% on your own. Coming back to puzzles at a later date with some new tricks and new headspace helps. There are also some great hint guides out there that will help without giving away the solutions. I highly recommend them if you don't want to be playing Baba Is You over the course of several weeks."
2518,2626,Its a great game. It keeps making your brain think alternative solutions to win each level. It's greatly designed
2519,2626,10/10
2520,2626,"11/10- puzzles with various difficulties- nice graphic- easy to learn- if you think you have finished the game, you're not.- many secrets to be found.- GAME IS GOOD- BABA IS YOU- BABA IS HAPPY"
2521,2626,"So hard, but so much fun! For many levels, the title is a hint. I've got the idea from the title for many times."
2522,2626,Baba is yeah
2523,2626,"I would recommend this to others. In this game you rewrite the rules so you can win. Frustration is unavoidable if you are to play this game. Through exposing yourself to frustration in this low stakes environment you might be able to develop your capacity to cope with adversity in your own life. I can't say for sure. It's a good game. If you are having trouble with a puzzle, come back a day later, after you've slept. You figure out some of the problems as you sleep. Try and get your 8 hours in - that's good advice even if you don't buy this game.Take care."
2524,2626,"Very clever little game. You need to be in a very coding kind of mood to play it, but it's quite satisfying when you are."
2525,2626,gr8 gamm. masst hwf.
2526,2626,"It is pretty well done. Some of the puzzles are fairly challenging, although mostly because it can be hard to get the mechanics figured out without a fair bit of trial and error. Still, highly recommended."
2527,2626,"ME ON BABA IS WIN.Baba is hard but baba is (almost) always fair and possible. You learn the mechanics as you go, as should a good puzzle game be. And this is a good puzzle game. It has so much content, winning is only half-way to finishing. It gets even better after you win.'baba is hint' has some excellent, low spoiler hints for when your brain is totally stuck."
2528,2626,10/10
2529,2626,game is good
2530,2626,"really fun, really hard, great time and everyone should try it out"
2531,2626,"The puzzles are hard, but rewarding once you figure them out. I recommend playing, but it's a hard game."
2532,2626,"I really recommend this game. The mechanics are unique, simple, but constantly surprise you with new challenges and a huge amount of complex and perplexing puzzles."
2533,2626,"Wanna question your intelligence and your ability to think logical? There you go. Right here.BABA IS YOU is a cute and lovely, but challenging puzzle game! ^_^ It's simple in its logic, but it can be really tricky in execution. You have to change the conditions to win, but not everything is changeable. Sometimes more is changeable than you initially think. Lots of out-of-the-box thinking. The joy, when you find a solution to a level that you racked your brain about, is huge! Or the shame. That's situational.Lots of fun, lovely soundtrack, lovely characters!"
2534,2626,Baba is Fun
2535,2626,brain broke playing this game
2536,2626,I love the concept of changing the rules. would recommend 5 star.
2537,2626,Very fun game! Some easy puzzles and many that broke my brain.
2538,2625,It's a good puzzle game!If you don't know why I would like Baba is You go watch the promotional material. If that sounds interesting this game is perfect. Baba Is Good.
2539,2625,"The premise is so simple you think it will be easy. I won't say it's overly difficult, but it's definitely tricky and requires multiple strategies to complete the game. Just when you think you've got the game figured out, it throws a new rule at you or requires a different strategy. It's really everything you want in a good puzzle game. Cannot recommend enough."

2545,2625,AWESOME!!!
2546,2625,great puzzle game
2547,2625,This is one of the most thought provoking games I've ever head the pleasure of playing. It asks you to think so far outside the box that the box ceases to exist.A massive Yes from me.
2548,2625,"Baba is You is an outstanding and extremely innovative puzzle game. From the overland island map, you select various levels, each containing word blocks and objects as puzzle layouts. The goal is make use of the text blocks in such a way as to meet the victory conditions. What exactly constitutes a ""win,"" even what entity you control, can be changed by linking certain words together. Many puzzles have multiple possible solutions. You also have the option to rewind moves or reset the map if necessary. The game's length, content, and ingenious features easily justify the price."
2549,2625,Mind-melting.  This is a grown-up's puzzle game -- be careful to not injure your brain.
2550,2625,Really cool game
2551,2625,"I loved the descriptor from one review... the ""Dark Souls"" of puzzle games. Cute, fiendishly hard, never ""unfair."""
2552,2625,does an amazing job at making me feel actually mentally disabled on a moment-to-moment basis
2553,2625,Absolutely amazing! WHO is YOU WHAT is WIN BABA is YOU BABA is WIN~~~ brain teasing and word games to the max XP
2554,2625,Baba is YOU! It's challenging but totally worth it.
2555,2625,This is an amazing game that really tests your problem-solving and creative thinking skills. I played some of it myself and some of it with my 8-year-old son and we both had a blast working together to figure out solutions to each puzzle. I highly recommend this to anyone that enjoys out of the box puzzle solving challenges.
2556,2625,"I may be wrong, but I think this is one of a kind game. I have not seen or heard of another game with similar mechanics. This alone makes this game a must-play.Some people probably would prefer flashier graphics, but I don't mind, because the puzzles are the core things here."
2557,2625,"BABA is You is probably the best game that is way too smart for me, and i think that is the only way i can put it. It's amazing 9/10 one of the most fun and interesting puzzle games i have played and the only reason it's a 9 is because i cant beat it yet."
2558,2625,Nice game to relax
2559,2625,"Very challenging and full of surprised, if you have the perseverance find everything that isn't apparent."
2560,2625,This game is so good and it can teach you
2561,2625,"The logic in this game is faulty. Not the programming, the game design is faulty and logic is 100% what this game is about. I may just be frustrated at it because I've been trying for so long but I'm pretty sure the logic on some levels is either inconsistent with the rest of the levels or there is a list of unwritten rules which you have to look up or be stymied for no good reason. I'm a fan of puzzle game and enjoy them most of the time. With this game I spend much more time frustrated than enjoying it."
2562,2625,"a fascinating and very challenging puzzle game. nearly the definition of ""think outside the box"""
2563,2625,Great and original puzzle game.
2564,2625,"cute aesthetic? check. soundtrack is a bop? check. engaging puzzles? double check. i'm not very good at these, but they still find a way to be fun and make me want to come back to levels that stumped me before. it makes me think and problem-solve outside the box with every level. Good Game Design."
2565,2625,"If you love thinking outside the box, you will love this game. A lot. Its difficult enough to be hard but not enough to make you frustrated. If you are stumped you can 99 percent of the time choose to play another level instead, so you feel like you're progressing. This will make you feel smart."
2566,2625,"Makes you feel really smart for a while, then really stupid for a lot longer, Haha!"
2567,2625,Super creative and challenging puzzle game. Will stump even the most seasoned veterans.
2568,2625,"It's got a lot of really fun puzzles. The constant changing of the rules keeps things fresh, and quite challenging at times. I can easily sit down to play for a few minutes, and the next time I look at the clock six hours have passed. Highly recommend to anyone who wants a mental challenge, also anyone with add/adhd. Although, I guess that statement could be said of most video games. So... What I think I'm trying to say is that I feel like I've actually used my brain for good after playing this game vs some others where it just kinda feels like mush."
2569,2625,"This is the most inventive and hard puzzle game I have played.Changing the rules around is fun as hell!Now then, to wait for the level editor..."
2570,2624,This game is a super little puzzle game

2575,2624,"A brain bending puzzle game worthy of your timeAfter playing this game for a few hours, I introduced it to my youngest son, who spent an extraordinarily long time on the first level. We then spent many hours shouting nonsense phrases like ""dad is wall"", and ""chair is noodle"" and laughing uproariously.This game challenges the way you think. Literally. You will no longer think of rules as fixed. They are only as fixed as the words in your head. You will question everything. Reality will crumble in the face of your newfound insight. It has great replay value because you won't remember how to solve the puzzles. They do not stay in your head overnight. Your brain will reject the solutions.Go buy it. Play it. Tell Baba I said hello."
2576,2624,Fantastic game allowing for a variety of solutions to puzzles and a logical progression to the mechanics. Fantastic mind bender!
2577,2624,"Amazing puzzler. My mind has well and truly been boggled in every way I thought it could be, and more."
2578,2624,"Havn't played a puzzle game that makes me feel stupid in a whileI don't miss it, but that just makes the puzzles more satisfying to complete. I'm nowhere near beating the game and for once i'm not sure if I ever will.Baba is a  but its a fantastic new style of puzzle"
2579,2624,"This game is truly a masterpiece! I highly recommend it, especially if you like puzzle games."
2580,2624,yeah it good
2581,2624,noice
2582,2624,This game was soo hard but it's also fun
2583,2624,Probably the best puzzle game I have ever played. The concept of moving words to modify rules seems so simple but some of the puzzles are fiendishly difficult which makes the satisfaction all the more intense. Always great to spend a few minutes once in a while to look at a puzzle and have the solution suddenly jump to you the next day
2584,2624,yes
2585,2624,"This is my favorite puzzle game. The concept is executed perfectly, and I had tons of fun discovering the secrets it has to offer. Now would also be a great time to pick this up, with the level editor getting close to leaving public beta."
2586,2624,baba is good
2587,2624,Just a great puzzle game that is easy to play with a group.  The logic is fairly transparent and doesn't demand a lot of knowledge beyond what is present on the screen.
2588,2624,its great!
2589,2624,This game sets your mind to work for fun.
2590,2624,"Everything about this game is great - apart from the gameplay.It gives you an initial glimpse at something that looks brilliant.A really simple, cute game in which you make up the rules about how to beat it.But that's not what this game is. Instead of having a few basic rules and loads of options, it's loads of rules an no real options.The only option is to identify the convoluted way the designer has chosen to solve each level.It creates a frustrating and tedious experience."
2591,2624,"I'm about 3 hours in and I love this game. Its really challenging but in a fun and weirdly easy way... in the sense that when you get it, it feels elementary... but that eureka moment needs many dead ends before it"
2592,2624,"This game starts out cute and fun with mind disorienting puzzles.  However, it starts getting a bit tedious as the game starts exploring more ""game breaking"" mechanics that aren't very well explained.Examples of game breaking mechanics that must be used to solve puzzles that aren't well introduced:- Pushing text onto your own character- Overlapping text on the same tile to create dual effects- Using double NOT's / NOT's grammar logic being obtuseDon't get me wrong, this game is amazing. My gripe is that you'll start to learn that most puzzles in this game have one gimmick and that's all you need to solve the entire puzzle, and not knowing how to discover that gimmick is naturally is where this game is weak. As a completionist, it makes puzzles feel more like homework rather than something you enjoy doing for fun."
2593,2624,this game is hard and i hate it but also buy it it's fun
2594,2624,great
2595,2624,The most creative puzzle game I have ever played.
2596,2624,Game of the year.
2597,2624,"if you want some mind , this is the game"
2598,2624,Great game.
2599,2624,"I used to say that I am good at playing puzzle games.But after this,I won't say that again."
2600,2624,A unique puzzle game. Challenging and cute.
2601,2624,good game
2602,2624,"This game is basically simple programming with blocks. You need to kind of break the game or use its own mechanics against it at times, and it really makes you think outside-the-box. Quite challenging and enjoyable."
2603,2624,"So good. The puzzle game that keeps you on your toes from the first puzzle to the last. When you think you have this game figured out, you learn you are so so wrong. Every solution leaves you feeling like you were just let in on an inside joke. You can't help but laugh when you fall right into the traps that the puzzle setter put in your path. I love watching friends and family play this game just as much as playing it myself. Watching their brains turn and the joy that comes with each solution. 10/10"
2604,2624,BRAIN   IS   DEAD  GAME   IS   GOOD
2605,2624,"Unique puzzle game that doesn't really compare to any other games. The basic idea is to change the rules that govern each level, in order to pass the level. The rules are presented as blocks that you can manipulate by pushing them around. Sometimes you have to completely break the game in order to pass the level. Sometimes more subtle changes are enough. However, out-of-the-box -thinking is required almost always.The game is difficult, but mostly there're always other areas and levels that you can try if you can't pass some specific level.  Probably there's a point where you have only seemingly impossible levels left, but after solving 60+ levels, I haven't reached it yet. Actually there's multiple areas I haven't even tried yet. Of course, you have to solve some levels in order to unlock new areas, but at least in the beginning of the game, this isn't that difficult."
2606,2624,"the puzzles are very intruguing, and mind-bending"
2607,2623,its just....... GREAT
2608,2623,"I like: Making myself feel very smart, a fun look into programming logic and sequenceI dislike: Making myself feel very stupid (but that's ok), that music in Forest of Fall wtf"
2609,2623,baba is uhhh  something
2610,2623,yes
2611,2623,no other game will make you feel like a mensa genius for beating it like baba will
2612,2623,Baba Is You. No Like? Too Bad. Because You Already Baba.
2613,2623,Yes.
2614,2623,brain hurts. i feel stupid. I will keep playing
2615,2623,head hurt
2616,2623,"The music is repetitive but in a good way, like masturbation. The graphics are quirky and bad like my uncle Mike--but that makes things interesting.What I can't forgive though is the atrocious writing. ""Baba is sink,"" ""keke is you,"" ""fart is mouth."" Who wrote this drivel? I know Hempuli Oy is an indie developer but for the love of Trump I hope they hire some competent writers for their next title."
2617,2623,", "
2618,2623,"I recommend this game for those who are up for a challenge. It's very puzzling, the answer can be the most random thing. That's part of the fun! Very nice design with interesting music. If you're one who gives up easily though, I wouldn't suggest you play it."
2619,2623,love it
2620,2623,Level design is very inventive. Patterns are non-recurring and difficulty goes progressively. It's a great game for lockdown!
2621,2623,"Amazing game for anyone, especially if you love solving puzzles!"
2622,2623,"Deceptively simple, unbelievably creative.  Extremely charming and thought provoking puzzle game.  Encourages logical and critical thinking skills."
2623,2623,"I'm a big puzzle fan, and I want to say: it's THE best puzzle game ever. At least, in 2020. It's better then Portal, Talos Principle, Recursed or anything else. If you know something better, please write a comment."
2624,2623,"This is one of the few games that I've recently lost sleep over, either from playing it or trying to figure out a level while lying in bed. So many levels require a completely new technique so solve -- I am simply in awe of the imagination that went into this game."
2625,2623,10/10
2626,2623,"Fantastic puzzle game, one of the very best"
2627,2623,my brain hurt
2628,2623,"Clever puzzle game with unique mechanics, my only gripe is that it's not available on mobile so I can play it everywhere."
2629,2623,Wonderfully engaging puzzle game where you have to write and change the rules yourself to get things to work.
2630,2623,my brain hurts
2631,2623,"I've been obsessed with puzzles my whole life, and initially I wasn't sure what to make of Baba Is You, but turns out it is one of the best puzzle games I've ever played. The simple premise of constructing rules is built up to form a rich variety of puzzles, with extremely imaginative use throughout.I recommend the game, but with two caveats: 1) The difficulty of the game ramps up very fast. You might blast through the first set of levels with no problem, but pretty soon you'll be patting yourself on the back and organising a parade every time you solve one level, or even a small part of one level. 2) Some rules are a bit unpredictable, especially when two rules apply to the same object. You'll need to experiment around before you start thinking!This game isn't for everyone, but if it sounds like the above caveats won't worry you then I would thoroughly recommend :)"
2632,2623,"The graphics are cute, gameplay is mindbendingly interesting and fun for all ages. Don't let the adorable bunny fool you."

2635,2623,"This game is great. It makes me feel stupid, as all good puzzle games should."
2636,2623,"A unique and endlessly clever puzzle game about manipulating rule sets by pushing text blocks around. Highly recommend giving it a shot even if you aren't that into puzzle games as the early game eases you in around the basic concept well, late game can be a challenge tho."
2637,2623,"One of the hardest puzzle games I've ever played, and one of the cleverest. My brain hurts in the best way."
2638,2623,"Very innovative concept. Fun to play. Quite difficult, so can be frustrating for people who don't enjoy working through challenges."
2639,2623,exceptional genius
2640,2623,"As a wise man once said ""Baba is the Dark Souls of puzzle games"". So if your not a big brain, this game will be cause a lot of pain. Actually even if you are a big brain thou brain shalt implode."
2641,2622,"This truly is one of the hardest puzzle games i have played, it forces you to think about all the aspects of the level. there are times when you won't know what to do just because you forgot a mechanic or what logic proceeds another. And even though completing this will be the hardest thing you will ever do (if you don't cheat), baba is a good game"
2642,2622,This game is incredibly fun
2643,2622,BRAIN HAS HURT. GAME IS GOOD. BABA IS CUTE.
2644,2622,One of the best puzzle games I've ever played.
2645,2622,An amazing game with great gameplay that offers more than meets the  eye.
2646,2622,The premise is simple but the puzzles are challenging. You get to constantly discover new ways to use the tools in the game to solve the problems. The mechanics are user friendly. It's a great game you can come back to if you haven't played for a while. 100% recommend.
2647,2622,"Nice logic puzzles of varying levels. The game gets you to look at things in a different way, which is always a plus for me. Also, if you're really stuck somewhere, there are youtube videos to help you along."

2649,2622,Frustration is you
2650,2622,Very clever puzzler
2651,2622,Fantastic puzzle solving game that will test your mettle.
2652,2622,This game is absolutely incredible. Such a blast. Often the ability to solve a puzzle will seem just out of reach until you assess what options you truly have and work on thinking way outside the box. It's like scratching an itch in your brain. Every level is fresh and so well thought-out.I can't recommend this game enough.

2664,2622,"Starts off easy, there's enough to enjoy, gets fiendishly difficult if you want to complete it all."
2665,2622,"If you want a challenge and enjoy non-normal thinking, buy this game. Though, be warned, you WILL spend long periods of time on one level.Many, many, many times."
2666,2622,"This is one of the most simple games to understand how it works, but it has endless mind bending complexity to it at the same time."

2672,2622," incredible game, proven by the fact that you cant look up a walkthrough for a whole world, only individual levels. play it blind and just go on"
2673,2622,"it's the best puzzle game on Steam, simple as that"
2674,2621,awesome

2678,2621,"good, but im stupid"
2679,2621,Innovative playstyles. Challenging puzzles. Worth to try!
2680,2621,Very fun puzzle game.
2681,2621,good
2682,2621,Infuriatingly difficult in the best way possible. I frequently come back after giving up on a puzzle and solve it in a few seconds - which is the mark of a game that does a fantastic job of making you think outside the box.
2683,2621,A charming and mind bending game
2684,2621,"It may be a little unappealing to some due to the art style, but that is the only thing I will say negatively about this game.  The puzzles are good. The grouping of things to help you learn is great. The amount of content is deep... inception beware!  I consider myself to be fairly adept with logic and puzzles and I took just over 50 hours in my play through to get 100%.  I was hesitant to buy at full price, so when it cam on sale for it's anniversary I got it...Now I realize that it's totally worth full price.  Especially as the developer has continued to update it."
2685,2621,"Simple and funny. If you happen to have the logic of a dog (maybe an elephant? not sure yet) that can read and is goal oriented, this game is for you!"
2686,2621,"This game is really fun, interesting, and original. I don't recommend playing this game if you aren't a fan of log or critical thinking. It provides a very new take on logic/puzzle games. Super fun very challenging 10/10,"
2687,2621,A wonderful puzzle game that manages to be challenging and rewarding without being frustrating.
2688,2621,Something special.
2689,2621,"A very inventive game. The first handful of levels are an absolute blast, because it's a joy to figure out this game's unique rule set. Once you get the hang of things, it begins to feel more like a normal (but still very good) puzzle game, although there were also some really fun late-game moments that wowed me just as much as the beginning. So, overall, this is a great puzzle game with a few really cool moments. Absolutely worth checking out if you like puzzlers."
2690,2621,"Fun, challenging, and unique. Often requires very out-of-the box thinking, which is always wonderful to see."
2691,2621,"One of the best puzzle games, very simple to understand and very difficult the deeper you go into the levels. Not all levels are good but 95% of them are which is very rare to find in puzzle games."
2692,2621,Very difficult but fun

2695,2621,"Game is easy to learn, puzzles can be difficult - a challenging game but you play at your own pace."
2696,2621,This game makes me think it's . Then I solve it then it is good.
2697,2621,Extremely clever puzzle game with that gets a ton of depth out of it's simple but interesting concept.
2698,2621,Amazing game. It's simple ruleset allows for a large variety of puzzles.
2699,2621,There it is!
2700,2621,Total mind-bender and often hilarious!
2701,2621,"If you love puzzle games, Baba Is You is a definite recommendation. After playing through everything it has to offer, I can easily say that it has every component of a great puzzle game and executes all those elements wonderfully. Its mechanics are easy to understand, yet have enough depth to uncover to never become boring or repetitive throughout the entirety of the game. The levels range from easy tutorial levels to mind numbingly difficult, but the solutions are never cheap. The soundtrack is great and the art is charming. Perhaps my favorite part about it is that with many of the levels that I was stuck on the solution did not reveal itself while playing, but while doing mundane activities like brushing my teeth, because the game knew how to stick in my head. It took me rather long to beat on account of me being sometimes dumb and slow on experimenting with the mechanics, but all in all I am satisfied with what I got and hope that others playing it will get just as much if not more out of it."
2702,2621,If you ever wanted to feel smart and completely idiotic all at the same time this is your game.
2703,2621,very hard like my pp
2704,2621,"Clever fun puzzles, charming style. Utterly wonderful."
2705,2621,This game makes you think in lateral ways.
2706,2621,Good hustle
2707,2621,"It's a very well-designed puzzle game. The graphics are unique. The music is pleasant. The design is like nothing I've played before. It is however very challenging to pass some stages, but that just makes it more fun to play. With the ability to undo moves at any time though it always feels fair."
2708,2621,super fun award-winning puzzler. Why are you reading this.
2709,2621,BABA IS YOU AND FUN       IS    GOOD     AND     BUY
2710,2621,"I haven't had this much fun with a puzzle game since Braid!An absolute joy with an innovative twist on the classic ""sokoban"" block-pushing puzzlers featuring a great design foundation. When it gets complicated it doesn't feel convoluted, and when it gets very difficult it's because the design is so clever, not because it's ""hard for the sake of being hard""."
2711,2621,"This game has the most insanely arbitrary rules. There's almost zero consistency from level to level as to what works. I can't believe I blew $15 on this POS. I absolutely love puzzle games, even very difficult ones, but this game is 90% trial and error as to what works. Things that work on one level suddenly don't work on others. Great concept for a puzzle game but horrifically executed. A few of the puzzles were great but there were so many that even after I figured it out made zero sense. It's not a difficulty thing because some of the best puzzles were the ones where they took me a while. There's a reason that the game doesn't explain to you how the game mechanics work, because if it did then everyone would see how terrible the game really is."
2712,2620,"great test of logic, rule breaking and abstract problem solving"
2713,2620,"Great game, hard puzzles. It's one of those games where the solution is obvious after you've done the puzzle."
2714,2620,The dopamine hit when you finally manage to finish a level is just too strong!
2715,2620,baba
2716,2620,This game will bend your mind and crunch it into little little pieces
2717,2620,The puzzles are deeper than the first impression.Highly recommended for anyone who loves challenging puzzles.
2718,2620,noice
2719,2620,
2720,2620,good ass puzzles
2721,2620,"Early game is fun as you explore. Lots of neat puzzles requiring lateral thinking. That goes on for quite a while. Eventually the puzzles throw enough rules in place that they force you into one particular solution, always obscure, and not really fun anymore to find. Regardless most of the game is fun and worth your while, and I would recommend it."
2722,2620,Amazingly creative puzzle game. Can get hard!
2723,2620,Fun and makes you think.
2724,2620,"Baba is a strategical puzzle game created as if the programmer and storyboard writer swap places. It is quirky, challenging, and fun. The mechanics besides (empty) are well designed and intuitive. Your brain will expand and shrink in the same rate during the day. Baba is you rewards clever gameplay and planning. The music is nice and the graphics grow on you. I would highly recommend. I am Baba and so are you."
2725,2620,"Baba Is You is one of the best puzzle games I have ever experienced. After fully completing this amazing game, I can proudly call myself Baba."
2726,2620,Underneath the cute appearance is a horrendously difficult puzzle game. It's incredibly clever and unique in its style. 10/10 would continuously return to over and over and over again because these cute puzzles haunt me in my dreams.
2727,2620,A difficult yet fun game that requires thinking outside the box
2728,2620,Really analytic game!
2729,2620,"Simply amazing puzzle game. The concept of letting you solve puzzles by manoeuvring rules that appear as movable pieces on the grid along with all other objects in the level is brilliant. I never feel like this game ramps up the difficulty in cheap ways (bigger levels with more objects or too many rules). It rarely forces you to lose time fiddling with the actual execution. It's all about finding the right ideas. It was a delight to find out about weird interactions between properties. You can get to the normal ending without having to solve the real brain-busters, but there's a lot of added value for those who want to discover all the extras and secrets. Definitely recommended."
2730,2620,revolutionary coding game!
2731,2620,"I'm not especially good at this game, or very far into it, but nonetheless very enjoyable."
2732,2620,This game is amazing!
2733,2620,Great puzzle game.
2734,2620,Yes
2735,2620,Baba is good
2736,2620,Game design is brilliant and deserves all the awards it's been nominated for!
2737,2620,its a good game
2738,2620,"Gameplay mechanics are simple but the way they are used makes some of the puzzles really complicated and mind boggling.Truly a masterpiece of a puzzle game with tons of levels (+200) with their own twists and surprises right up to the end, levels just keep getting harder and harder.It is worthwhile to take breaks when playing this game to reset your way of thinking as sometimes cycling through the different options how to complete a level, you will get stuck trying to use solution that has worked on couple earlier levels and it will make you stuck completely. (or at least that happened to me couple of times)If you like puzzle games I can recommend this one a lot, for the price and the amount of levels it has, it is well worth it.For people looking to 100%, well it is puzzle game so you can find solutions/hints for everything, but considering how many levels it has it will still take you decently long time (I would guess at least 15-20h) to complete the game 100%."
2739,2620,Really makes you think outside the box. And sometimes box is you.
2740,2620,Truly Amazing!
2741,2620,An elegant mind game. Very difficult but is a great gift to problem solving lovers.
2742,2620,A game in the Sokoban family but with an interesting twist that you are manipulating sentences that determine the rules.  Do not be afraid to make combinations that at first seem absurd.  I must admit that I have on a few occasions Googled for hints to get past particularly challenging levels; there are sites that give hints short of a walk through and often a small nudge is all that is needed.
2743,2620,"These are quite challenging puzzles.  The gameplay reminds me of the concept of ""escape rooms"".I think the high price is justified, because the game uses an EXQUISITE multi-move undo that really sets it apart from other puzzle games.  You can make as many moves as you like in a puzzle and jam on the back button and undo them all if you like.And the puzzles are fantastic.  There is a deep satisfaction in solving them.How does it work?- Puzzle ""rooms"" are locked down several branched paths, so if you get stuck on a puzzle, there will still be several others you can work on branching in a different direction.  This feature is golden.- To solve a puzzle, push words around to affect the rules- Reach a win condition.For example, the default win condition in many puzzles is ""FLAG IS WIN"".  But you can push the word ""FLAG"" away from ""IS WIN"" and now it's no longer a win condition.  By pushing the rule words around you can eventually reach a win condition - but sometimes the rules are not obvious and how things work have to be inferred or just experimented with to see whether your idea is going to work.  It's wonderful fun and a great feeling of being completely lost and trying various ideas to find a solution.  They are all very diverse puzzles and the thought process changes from one puzzle to another (at least it felt this way for me).https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2035514518The graphics, for as simplistic as they are, are very nicely animated which adds HUGE depth to the gameplay and atmosphere.I really hesitated writing a review because of the high price of this game, and after playing it for a while the features won me over.  This is not your every-day cranked out puzzle game - a lot of love and diligence went into the implementation and I think it's worth a try, especially if you like these sorts of puzzles."
2744,2620,game is good
2745,2620,"This is a cute and clever puzzle game where you win by changing the rules: the rules are literally spelled out by blocks that you can push around and rearrange. You'll need to experiment to learn what exactly each new rule means. Try lots of things, and don't be afraid to undo or restart the level! What you discover along the way will surprise and delight you (and help you solve the puzzles). This game is best played with friends. There's no multiplayer mode, but the puzzles get challenging fast, and it will be less frustrating with another person to help brainstorm. This works best when whoever has an idea can take over the keyboard, but it can also work over screenshare, especially if you both have a copy of the game so you can trade off who controls each level."
2746,2620,really fun game. a bit frustrating at times but i love how there's a lot of creative thinking involved in trying to get through each level. would recommend highly for puzzle game enthusiasts
2747,2620,Every single level manages to introduce an entirely new concept and blow your mind with it.
2748,2620,A challenging puzzle game with a truly novel core mechanic.
2749,2620,"Hard but fun, and so rewarding when you get them. Feels unique for a puzzle game"
2750,2620,"This is so fun, frustrating and rewarding. Once you play it you start to love the out of the box mentality and that lovely bunny rabbit that is drawn like there is something awfully wrong in its movement, yet it runs around happily and just a bunnydust follows. There are things that I won't understand at the times and once it clicks, I'm at awe like a child.  And the beat or song background is so soothing it tames the nerves even in desperate times I am stuck. I feel that I need Baba in my real life too. <3"
2751,2620,"Be careful, this game is genius and evil. You may melt your brain while playing, so take breaks accordingly. Also note that this game isn't fast to finish. Far from it. Elseway it's incredible though!"
2752,2620,solution is hidebrain is weak
2753,2620,"This must be the Dark-Souls of puzzle-games xDJokes aside, this is by far the hardest puzzle game I've encountered and I played Antichamber. But ""Baba is You"" is as fair as it can be.You have a small set of game-rules, with which you can push blocks to create rules within a level. Every level-rule is written out on screen, as well as in the menue. So it's as fair as can be, without hidden mechanics or off-screen features.Yet unless I am really stupid, it's hard as hell - I can't play it for more than a couple minutes at a time, before I have to quit and get some off-time to think about the puzzlesor distract myself in hopes my brain will at some point get around to understand the puzzle.It's not just ""a"" unique challenge, but every new level feels like a completly new game, where you are going to learn something new, because the tricks you used before, won't be enough.So it's hard, it's challenging, but it's fair and you can restart every level within seconds or undo moves.What I don't know is if recommending solutions is a thing. It's a puzzle game, so looking up a solution defeats the purpose. But at the same time, with every level being a new challenge and me already feeling overwhelmed in the 3rd region..."
2754,2620,baba is you? yes. Baba is good? yes. Baba is all? yes.
2755,2620,dummy is me
2756,2620,"This game blows me away. Not only is the core concept genius, but the execution is flawless. Each level teaches you something new about the mechanics, but they're not easy. At this point, some puzzles take me over half an hour, if I get them at all in one session."
2757,2620,Most out of the box game that I have ever played
2758,2620,Best puzzle game.
2759,2620,"Really makes you think sometimes. Delightful game, 10/10 would recommend."
2760,2620,Amazebalsl. Simply amazeballs.
2761,2620,This is an extremely well done puzzle game that makes you thing about how game mechanics work. And how to use them creatively to achieve your goals. Highly recommended.
2762,2620,"Surprisingly non-formulaic for a puzzle game, every puzzle is a very unique challenge."
2763,2620,Probably the best and most creative puzzle game I've played.  It's very challenging.

2766,2620,Awesome! Very creative and fun!
2767,2620,"a really fun puzzle game with a interesting concept of messing with the rules in order to win,however i must say before you buy be ready to have you ass handed to you in the later stages as whilefun the later secret areas will really test how well you know and understand the rules as well as how well you know the abstract concepts of the game itself.by the end your going to be turning levels into levels and solving levels outside levels in sub-levels with levels like ""the box"" witch is not beatable level until you set up hub level of meta that is a sub level of the depth.but once you get around the mind bending logic and solutions it is really good and dose have them eurika moments, you can spend hours on 1 puzzle trying everything that seems to follow what you know with nothing working and you will sit there asking why then all of a sudden when it clicks and you get it, yerrr thats when you feel smart as you see the 1 thing you were missing.so its a great game that's worth the price but it dose have 1 hell of a difficulty rise once you beat the normal island and you enter the secret island, depths and beyond so if your going to buy it don't underestimate its child like crayon art style and easy main island puzzles or its going to beat your ass hard later."
2768,2620,"I'm only a little ways into the game, but I can already say it's worth picking up.This game is a very charming puzzle game with extremely unique and interesting mechanics. The rules are very simple to understand and pick up on, but the enjoyable thing about this game is how it pushes you to think outside the box. The rules in the game are there for you to manipulate in any combination of ways you can come up with, and the trial and error ""what if?"" process provides a novel sense of satisfaction as you brainstorm solutions and try them out. The difficulty level of this game is enjoyably challenging. Even for levels I found to be on the trickier side, I never felt frustrated or like giving up. The best part of the game comes from the ""aha!"" moment when you realize exactly what you need to do, and that feeling of triumph is something I'll be chasing after like an addict for many more hours to come!"
2769,2619,Actually hard puzzles..
2770,2619,Challenging but fun
2771,2619,Very creative puzzles with really nice background music. The minimalistic graphics really add to the experience.There are so many different interactions with different mechanics in the game and it feels so satisfying to find new ones. A must play for puzzle-game lovers!
2772,2619,Awesome and absolutely unique experience.
2773,2619,Awesome brain-melting puzzles!
2774,2619,game is funbaba is you
2775,2619,"Fun, challenging, and thought-provoking.The music is quite nice, but does get somewhat old after a while."
2776,2619,"It twists your brain, like any good puzzle game should."
2777,2619,great
2778,2619,amazing game
2779,2619,"Many challenging puzzles, lots of parts to think of at the same time."
2780,2619,"It's a very challenging game. Some of the puzzles are poorly designed but others are solvable if you just take your time with them.  Overall, I'm enjoying the game."
2781,2619,I've never enjoyed paying to feel dumb this much
2782,2619,baba is good
2783,2619,Never have I been ankle broken by a game before
2784,2619,BABA IS YOU AND GOOD
2785,2619,This game took a concept and explored it to its full potential beyond what I thought would be even possible to create. 10/10
2786,2619,The best puzzle game I've played in a while.
2787,2619,Baba is MeBrain is MushGame is Good
2788,2619,"I've gotten so tired of all of the shooters and remakes, and it's really refreshing to see that people are still making fresh new ideas like this. This game is simple, but piqued my interest like few other games can."
2789,2619,"Playing this game increased my IQ by a factor of a brilliquand (that's a number you learn about when your IQ passes seven hundillion). After seeing I logged over 20 minutes in this game, NASA called me and asked for my help in designing dogfood for people and Bill Gates made me his sole heir before killing himself by drowning in Windows XP installation CDs. Already I can feel the power of my big brain: my doctor tells me I have severe encephalitis. I write this review from my utopia-lounger in the space cruiser Elon Musk tells you about when your IQ breaks eleventy tentrallion, preparing myself for the release of Baba Is You 2, whereupon my cranium will embiggen (look it up) to encapsulate the known universe.5/5"
2790,2619,"exquisite and delicate gamevery well designed stages, all stages need a lot of time to think"
2791,2619,"I'm way too much of a brainlet to play this game but it's an absolutely amazing puzzle game, but, don't expect to beat all of it. Even though it's as simple as a kindergartner's homework sheet with the random words everywhere, it makes me feel like I'm about as dumb as one while playing it.Very well done game, give it a try even if you're not a big puzzle guy."

2793,2619,"Pure, brainstorming and subversive Fantastic puzzle game, dont save yoru wow"
2794,2619,"One of the best puzzle games I've ever played. Mind-bending, but friendly in how it slowly introduces new mechanics in the game."
2795,2619,good puzzle
2796,2619,"This is the best logic game I have ever played.Everything in ""Baba is You"" is about changing rules. Even thought it may look simple on trailer, every world introduces new tricky elements that are constantly blowing mind. Many of solutions are surprising, leading to feeling like ""wow, how did they invent it?"".Some levels are really hard, but not in means of ""cheap difficulty"". In most of them, there were only few elements... and I still had no idea how to combine them for long time. Resolving such puzzles brings much satisfation, especially because the game hits all the right boxes.I have much appreciation to developers, because game consists everything that I would expect from logic game. There are complex puzzles, original mechanics and funny world (and secret levels). I can't find proper words to describe ""Baba is You"" accurately - this is not just a game, this is an experience.In addtion, this experience is really long. Right now, after almost 25 hours, I have finished maybe around half of all levels.Grade: 10/10Postscriptum: I am quite experienced in logic games. Thus, I have to add a warning for less experienced players: you will have hard times. VERY hard times. In fact, experienced players will have hard times too, but I don't warn them, because I know they like it ;)."
2797,2619,"It's Super Meat Boy for your neurons.Genius bliss, beyond amazing."
2798,2619,BABA is STUPID
2799,2619,This Game is ingenious!
2800,2619,"Great game, really difficult puzzles."
2801,2619,A puzzle mechanic so pure and far-reaching that it has made me laugh on a number of occasions.Any game that can tell a joke in just three words gets a thumbs up from me.
2802,2619,"One of the most clever puzzle games I've ever played. I've put 10 hours into it and still barely halfway through the levels. It's really hard, so be ready for a challenge."
2803,2619,"My favourite puzzle game at this moment, I don't think I've ever seen one as creative and innovative as Baba Is You. Spent over 100 hours to collect all 226 spores and complete the game, giving me a lot of entertainment for 1-2 months until I got stuck on finding the final level, which took me many more evenings spread over the course of another month until I found the way. Highly recommended, money well spent."
2804,2619,this game is mind blowing!
2805,2619,"Played for 3 hours and loving it. Before this game I would have bet, that there's nothing one can possibly do with the Sokoban mechanic, that makes it more interesting and fun. Little did I know... :) Such a great Idea. Lovable simple design in both look and sound. Thanks for this great little game. I'm looking forward to get my brain scrambled in the levels to come."
2806,2619,Game is awesome. Baba is rock. Headblown is you.
2807,2619,"I've seen that others have played this game and thought I should try it. It is addictive and puzzling, I never want to stop because it's not fun, I only ever stop because I feel like I am missing something and am frustrated by how simple the design is but how complex the puzzles are. I plan on 100% this game like i usually do and would recommend this to anyone and everyone that likes puzzles and/or challenges."
2808,2619,brain is stop and melt
2809,2619,You is win
2810,2619,great game
2811,2619,"How do you describe a game like this? Brain stretching comes readily to mind. What looks like a simple puzzle game in the first instance, becomes increasingly more complex as you progress through the levels. In most games what you learn on one level helps you with the next, but not with this one. That makes it either annoying or more interesting because of the increased challenge.(I tend to think it makes it more interesting .. just me.) But if you like logical puzzles, querky graphics, and a challenge ... this one is for you. Love it!"
2812,2619,"Some of these levels make me feel really smart. Many others on the other hand make me feel like an absolute idiot. TLDR; it's a nice, challenging game, although the music might make you go insane when you're stuck on a level for too long."

2826,2618,"Phenomenally clever, interesting puzzles."
2827,2618,"You will grow to hate this game, it's inevitable. There's something deceptively simple about the difficulty. Lots of trial and error. The more configurations you try and fail, the harder it becomes to revise your approach, because the obvious options dwindle. It's easy to get stuck on the harder levels, but worth many hours of playtime.If you enjoy exploiting game mechanics then you will love this game. Devising clever combinations is a great skill to have if baba is you."
2828,2618,good game

2831,2618,Arguably the best puzzle game ever created. 10/10
2832,2618,"Some games make you think outside of the box. What makes this game special is that the box is doesnt exist, making your head spin in so many ways. In fact, its even a stretch to call it a game at all. Your way of solving a stage changes the level itself, and in turn how the game mechanics function. Buy it, trust me."

2837,2618,mind meltingmake sure you have lots of perseverancealcohol may be required
2838,2618,"Very fun puzzle game.Most challenges will be in theme with what you're supposed to do.You can have some light programmation with object moving conditions.You get to turn the world upside down.The main quest can be beaten very quickly if you're not a completionist... but if you love lasting challenges, there's a LOT to do even passed the main quest.it's cool."

2867,2617,clever and cute
2868,2617,"Probably the best puzzle game I have ever played. This is a real mind-twisting journey, that will blow your mind multiple times. And not only that, it is also easy to learn. Level are one-screen puzzles, which makes them easy to remember and you will think about their solutions even when you are not playing."
2869,2617,"An incredible elegant game.  It has a very simple but revolutionary idea and executes it in a perfect way. The puzzles become increasingly harder and harder, and will give you that sense of improvement every time you solve one. Easily worth the money!"
2870,2616,"The premise is simple enough: a puzzle game that lets you manipulate and rewrite the rules in each level to change how objects interact with one another. Don't have a key to open the door? Make 'BOX has KEY' and break the box to find one, or make 'BOX is OPEN' and use the box to unlock the door. Surrounded by an impassable wall? Separate 'WALL is STOP' and suddenly that wall is no trouble anymore. Can't cross the water to reach the flag and win? Maybe you'll have to give something else the 'WIN' condition instead...But it's not too long before the game starts to really test your wits, forcing you to engage in plenty of trial-and-error before a solution becomes apparent. Maybe you have several rocks and need to transform one - and only one - into a key. Maybe you need to control multiple characters at once, or temporarily lose control of them altogether. Maybe you'll even have to manipulate the empty spaces in the level to open a path to the goal. The game is challenging for sure, but it's also such a blast to encounter new keywords and figure out how to utilize them in creative ways to make the impossible possible.And there's one ingenious moment where, if you're clever enough, you'll discover just how meta this game can be...and it only goes deeper from there.It's difficult, it's fun, it's mind-boggling, and it's packed to the brim with ""Aha!"" moments. Everything that I enjoy about puzzles.GAME is LOVE"

The art is comforting, the music is atmospheric if not a little repetitive (not sure how you can avoid it in the case of puzzle games). It feels like a cohesive art piece, combining it's components in a appealing way, something that many puzzle games struggle to do. The difficulty is slowly ramped up, with plenty of additional options for those seeking for more out of the game.And with a level creator in the works, it's everything you could ask for in a game of this type."

2896,2616,"This game is challenging in a way that is consistently rewarding when you complete a level. The simplicity of it makes it charming and cute and helps to understand programming language more as well! It is a feel good game because you can come back to different puzzles later, and it even helps me to learn to deal with small frustrations. The mechanics are so simple yet you can do a variety of different things with it! I don't usually like puzzle games, but the simplicity of this one makes it one of my favorite games i've played. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who loves puzzle games or is looking for something new."
2897,2616,"The best puzzle game. period. Puzzles are open-ended, and the game encourages players to experiment with ideas.

2902,2615,"Just an excellent puzzle game, simple as that. The endgame is particularly clever!"
2903,2615,Genuinely the most innovative puzzle game I've ever played.
2904,2615,"Very innovative puzzles, though quite hard to solve. I had to take breaks to think or my MIND IS MELT. This game might be too hard for some people, e.g. casual players, children, new players in the puzzle genre. But for most people on Steam, this level of difficulty is not acceptable."
2905,2615,One of the best puzzle games I've ever played.
2906,2615,Baba Is Win
2907,2615,"One one hand, the game is good, with fun, interesting, challenging puzzles which usually introduce new mechanics or items which completely make you think differently about how the game works. Combine with unique yet simple visuals and good music, you got yourself a good game.On the other hand, the game is still good, but I found it too challenging for my poor dumb stinky brain.GAME is GOODisHARDHEAD IS HURTREVIEW is POSITIVE"
2908,2615,It manages to be both clever and charming while still making you sometimes want to break your keyboard in frustration.
2909,2615,Extremely well executed.  As an mid-western American I love to complain as much as the next person...  but I literally cannot think of a single thing to complain about regarding this game!  Amazing!
2910,2615,A marvelous brain-bender.

2912,2615,Game is good I is stupid
2913,2615,This game is unique and is great for anyone who even mildly likes puzzle games. It'll make you feel like a genius once you figure their puzzles out.
2914,2615,yes
2915,2615,"Baba Is You is one of those memorable puzzle games that will have you searching ""Games like Baba Is You"" and frustratedly realizing that nothing really like it exists. It is a truly unique puzzle game, and the frustration of staring hopelessly at a seemingly useless set of available words is exceeded only by the sense of achievement after completing that very same puzzle. Anyone who enjoys puzzle games would surely benefit from adding this game to their library."
2916,2615,BEST PUZZZLE GAME IVE EVER PLAYED! FULL PRICE WORTH IT!
2917,2615,This is a computer programming course under the guise of a video game and I loved it.
2918,2615,"Looks like simple, but it's NOT."
2919,2615,"This game absolutely rocks, one of the finest puzzlers ever made and with some ridiculously tough, brain twisting, satisfying solutions. You will be desperate to own this game as soon as the level editor comes out. Incredible work."

2921,2615,good
2922,2615,"Awesome puzzle game, love it!"
2923,2615,Game is good and recommend.Brain is hurt.
2924,2615,"What a great game with a great concept for puzzles. You can't take anything for granted, except for TEXT IS PUSH. That's it! Helps us broaden our perspectives for thinking, I think."
2925,2615,"Baba is You is an amazing game. It is extremely fun to play and it is quite difficult at the same time. It is very logic based, but it also has elements of tile games as well. I would very highly recommend his game to anyone considering buying it,"
2926,2615,Best puzzle game I have ever played. Some maps are extremely difficult. Satisfying when you solve a puzzle.
2927,2615,I really like the concept of changing the rules of the game in order to its very challenging. Be warned though it isn't a casual puzzle game for mindless time killing. It does demand a fair amount of attention from the player to really stare at the screen and strategize about what they should do. Highly recommend though! Dont let the graphics push you away its a lot of fun.
2928,2615,Unique puzzle game with some mind-bending logic.

2933,2615,Mermaid Gundam supports these fine products.
2934,2615,yes but its hard
2935,2615,"It's a good puzzler, a bit overated in my opinion. But defenitely okay to be in a top list! To say that it is one of the best puzzle games etc is really exageration, it was played like 10 times in a high level stream, you need way more to compare it to Talos, Portal 2 or Minesweeper"
2936,2615,"In this existential horror game, you play as a pink square with the word YOU written on it as you try to solve puzzles while remaining corporeal."
2937,2615,Nice
2938,2615,Highly recommend
2939,2615,"I initially really liked the game for the unique gameplay and soundtrack. The game became fairly challenging right after finishing the tutorial levels, just to become a frustratingly hard mess about 10% further down the road.I ended up just moving stuff around, having no clue what to actually do. The only thing I coud do was quit the level and try another one. After doing this a couple of times I realized that I wasn't having any fun with this game and just gave up on it.The concept and soundtrack is really good, the game is just way to hard (for me at least)."
2940,2615,"most innovative game i've seen so far. really easy and fun to get started, but the game can also provide migranes to the tenth power and madness if you're looking for a challenge"

2942,2614,review is win
2943,2614,I recommend this game.
2944,2614,Best puzzle game ever!
2945,2614,"It's a very nice game. I love games where, in order to beat the levels, you have to think outside the box. This really does that."
2946,2614,"this game is amazing, great for people who like hard challenges and puzzles"
2947,2614,Mind-bending tough puzzle action.  Unique.
2948,2614,best
2949,2614,Superb puzzle game where you have to cleverly bend the rules to win.It has plenty of levels with a nice difficulty curve to keep you entertained for hours.And all that is packed into a lovely old school vibe.
2950,2614,"this game makes me feel like a moron, very enjoyable"
2951,2614,Easily one of the best puzzle games / games I've played ever.
2952,2614,this game is an absolute masterpiece. 10/10
2953,2614,Puzzles become too hard too quickly.
2954,2614,of my new absolute favorites
2955,2614,"It is a godlike game. Not simply a collection of puzzles, but something that keeps making you thinking of problems from semantics and ontology."
2956,2614,Great puzzle game to get you in the mood for thought!
2957,2614,Bloody Brilliant
2958,2614,"Baba is you is a game with an innovative concept. The ability to alter rules to make innovative solutions and do crazy things! I love breaking rules in games, and this is basically the game about breaking rules! What could possibly go wrong?Unfortunately, the trailer is really misleading. You won't be making unexpected solutions and break every rule possible. Most of the time spent will be used to figure out the one solution developer wants you to perform. And difficulty is often based around Sokoban-style movement restrictions.At some point, I've lost my interest. It is not a bad game and it has it's fans, but it is not an open ended puzzle when you can invent your unorthodox solution and I've never really felt I did anything fun. My solutions weren't anything new, they were all pre-scripted. And I am allergic to Sokoban. Why is moving crates in tight corridors being such a deal? We've got technology to fix that crap. It's like spear throwing olympics."
2959,2614,This is an addicting puzzle game.  If you enjoyed the LoLo series you will love this.
2960,2614,Possibly the greatest puzzle game
2961,2614,BABA IS YOUISBUYANDPLAY
2962,2614,I hate puzzle games but this is awesome.
2963,2614,An absolutely wonderful puzzle game. Absurd in the best possible way.
2964,2614,it's good
2965,2614,"Great, mind bending puzzles."
2966,2614,I lost plenty of brain cells.
2967,2614,huge Brian cells
2968,2614,"If a good puzzle has a solution that's hard to find yet simple, then this game has good puzzles."
2969,2614,"This game is a wonderful concept, but sadly the execution is lacking.To summarize: this is a puzzle game that could thrive greatly on being a sandbox. As much as this game is about bending or breaking the ""rules"", every single level is absolutely 100% rigid. There is only one solution the developer has in mind, and rest assured that it is the only solution to the level. If you dare find an alternate route, it will be patched out."
2970,2614,"I wish I was better at it, but damn, when you figure a puzzle out, you feel like a genius."
2971,2614,"Baba Is You is a brutally hard puzzle game where you manipulate the very mechanics themselves to jury rig a route to victory. It's sleek, simple, and easy to pick up and understand. It's also deceptively difficult, to the point that the game becomes mentally taxing to play. After the initial puzzles, the game ramps up the difficulty to the extreme, making the overall game laborious to complete. Only the most dedicated of puzzlers will enjoy this.The game is about solving puzzles by remixing common phrases to change the logic of the game. Rather than solve the puzzles in a straight forward manner, you have to shift things around in order to carve a path to the goal. Sometimes this might involve taking control of another character, changing the goal to be something else, deleting certain elements blocking your path, or even manipulating abstract concepts. It's been described as ""programmer-y"", though I would describe it as ""semantic-y"". It's not in the same vein as Space Chem, Infinifactory, or 7 Billion Humans, where you're altering a sequence that has to execute in real time. It's more like you're editing static settings values at specific locations. If there is code ""executing"", you're inside the sequence that's being executed. If that sounds utterly confusing, ignore the previous statements.Baba Is You is definitely brilliant, there is no doubt about that. The mechanics are simple yet mind-bending, the presentation is clean, and the overall game feels smooth to play.However, it fails primarily in execution. While the gameplay is easy to pick up and parse, the game ramps up the difficulty from a tiny incline to a vertical wall roughly 10% into the game, and does so in the most frustrating and tedious ways possible. Once you clear the early stages, expect to spend at least an hour on a single puzzle.It took me a while to really wrap my head around why the game became so difficult. I kept hopping around, or coming back to previous stages, or skipping sections entirely to make progress. With each puzzle, my eyes would glaze over as I took in all the variables and impediments. I'd block out an idea in my head, only to hit some proverbial wall that the developer had actively placed. I'd get half way to a solution, only to have a tiny detail invalidate the whole attempt. I'd restart, over and over, getting more worn down as the game threw out edge case after edge case at me.Eventually, I realized I wasn't having any fun at all. In fact, during the first few stages, when my eyes were wide and my imagination was open, I was quite enthusiastic about playing. Once that faded, I stopped looking forward to puzzles, and instead looked for excuses to quit. It became a blackhole that I'd boot up, where my fun went to die.I've played a lot of puzzle games, both easy and hard. I'd like to think I'm competent enough at the genre to know when something isn't fun.Puzzle games are about reaching solutions using analysis or trial and error. As I see it, there are two types of reasonable puzzles. Those with one solution, and few variables; or those with many solutions, and many variables. Deviation from this introduces too much noise into the puzzle, making it far more difficult to solve.Baba Is You's puzzles have only one intended solution, and are rigidly bulletproofed against any sort of creativity. Despite being a game about reinventing the rules, you're really just retracing the developer's intended path. If you don't see the puzzle the same way they do, then you'll have to keep retrying until you do. You're not thinking outside the box, you're thinking inside the developer's box.Baba Is You's puzzle structure has too many steps and too many things to keep track of. You're trying to solve a puzzle with a large number of possible moves and variations, with no capacity to improvise. You'll spend 30 minutes devising a solution only for the last step to fail, just because it's not ""the"" solution. To make matters worse, some puzzles require a setup that naturally cascades into the solution over the course of several moves. Good luck formulating those.If that weren't enough, many of these puzzles also rely on quirks that you'd only discover by pure luck. A new block will be introduced with a patronizly easy puzzle, and then afterwards ramp up to the point of absurdity. Once I realized that certain puzzles were unsolvable unless you knew a specific strategy, I began future puzzles with the nagging sense that I wasn't equipped to solve them. How am I supposed to walk the logic back when I don't know if you're going to be using the same rules you taught me in the previous examples?If the game's puzzles were small, one solution would be fine. If the game was open-ended, and you could solve in any way you could make it work, then having complex puzzles would be acceptable. If the quirky behaviour was better telegraphed or implied, rather than undetectable until you waste multiple hours on a seemingly ""impossible"" puzzle, then unexpected behaviour would be welcome. To marry one solution with such complexity, while also introducing rules with obscure behaviour, makes this tedious and mentally exhausting to solve.I must stress, this is not a slight against the actual concept of Baba Is You. I have no problem with manipulating the game's logic using semantics. I think this idea is genius, I just wish it was executed in a way where I would get to experience more than 20% of the game. These puzzles did not need to be this challenging, or at the very least, not until the very end of the game.The game boasts 220 puzzles, and I have no doubt that there are people out there who will enjoy it. I also realize there are people out there who see entire ultra hard crossword or sudoku books as hundreds of hours of fun. People who enjoy replaying the old text-based adventure games with extremely strict semantics. People who enjoy running through all of the Chip's Challenge games back to back. Does any of that sound appealing? Then this is probably THE game for you.If not... run far away. Only frustration, exhaustion, and regret await.I feel bad giving a negative rating to a game that displays such brilliance and purity of form. Perhaps if it weren't so blindingly hard, or tedious, or rigid, or obtuse, or mentally taxing, I could see myself giving this an easy masterpiece grade. In it's current state, it's far too challenging to complete. Its solutions are too specific, too cavernous, and too obscure to decode. To some people, this might as well be a positive review touting a game that is the epitome of puzzling excellence. I consider it a warning, mainly to ward off those mere mortals who fancy themselves as puzzlers.Steam Curator"
2972,2614,The real most innovative game of 2019.
2973,2614,"You will find out, over and over and over again, that this game is pure genius. It is difficult to fathom that this game can be created by a mortal human being."
2974,2614,Feeling stupid has never been so fun.
2975,2614,It's a really great puzzle game.
2976,2614,yum
2977,2614,"One of the best overall games I've played in years, and the best puzzle game I've ever played. Fantastic concept and execution."
2978,2614,Baba Is the definition of Puzzle. Its really good but the pacing of the game goes from ABC to rocket science real quick. Don't buy if you don't like puzzles.
2979,2614,interesting puzzle
2980,2614,Too hard :(
2981,2614,Very satisfying and unique puzzle game
2982,2613,More fun than i have ever had with a puzzle game
2983,2613,Nice and fun game to play if you feel like punishing yourself for no reason. This is somehow meant as a compliment.
2984,2613,"This is a really unique game, such as I've never seen in my life. Even tho the art style looks quite bland, the gameplay and puzzles are out of this world. Both challenging, funny and just plain fun. I would recommend this game to anyone who wants to play exotic games and wants a challenge."
2985,2613,"This isn't the Dark Souls of puzzle games. Not because it isn't hard as the depths of hell, but because Dark Souls, for all of it's esotericism, provides a mostly fair challenge where you learn from adversity and can collaborate with others to discover secrets, strategies and overcome challenges.Baba Is You is therefore more comparable to Ninja Gaiden on the NES. A game with difficulty which by all real standards is arbitrary and , yet still has diehard fans who enjoy that kind of difficulty. Unfortunately, (and feel free to insert your own hyperbolic analogy here), just because some people can find enjoyment in it doesn't actually make it good. I'm not bad at the game, by the way. I've 100% completed the first six worlds without actually looking up any solutions, and while I haven't 100% completed the rest of the game, I've made headway into all of the worlds (including the secret world and the secret world inside it). The thing is, were any of the solutions I discovered... fun? Honestly, a lot of the time, nah. The novelty of the system wears off fast, and while some of the levels can be clever, most of them are kind of unintuitive, with overly specific solutions that often expect you to do something that in any other game would bug the game out. Actually figuring the solution out to the challenging levels never feels rewarding, because it's either something that would have been obvious if the game made any attempt to explain it to you, or a obscure and overly specific solution that doesn't feel clever or rewarding to discover because it's more trial and error, narrowing down options, than actually working out a solution on your own terms. I'm guessing this kind of meta-stuff impressed people enough to convince them this game was good, and a lot of people who didn't get too far and just looked up the solutions because the game was too hard for them are either enamoured enough with the easy levels and how clever or meta the later levels seem, or too embarrassed to say the difficulty sucks and come off as unintelligent.I just don't think that as a puzzle game this is anywhere near as fun or clever as it's made up to be. It's hard, unintuitive and esoteric in an obnoxious way, and the trial-and-error puzzling with its narrow solutions is grating as often as it's entertaining. Is it a bad game? Perhaps not. But I wouldn't recommend it by any account."
2986,2613,"My favorite game of 2019, good game for anybody who likes puzzles."
2987,2613,Every programmer should play this game
2988,2613,"Fun game with amusing and surprising dynamics. Very challenging in places, but the tree-like structure lets you leave tricky problems for later while you attempt a different branch, instead. I am enjoying playing it with my partner, as we are at a similar level of mystification with respect to these problems, and two heads are better than one."
2989,2613,"Every so often, a game comes out that rewrites things. Not just ""peanut butter and chocolate"" stuff, but truly, fundamentally shifts the world of video games on its axis. The fluid intelligence and epic MINDBLOWINGEDNESS of BiY is the latest of this one. It's maddening in that way all revolutionary games are on top of going places even someone with experience coding is finding difficult. It is giving you the very language used to make cheat codes and making that as it is the rules. You are like unto a god, but a young, clumsy one.I may actually finish it one day too!"
2990,2613,Player likes game. one of the best games i've ever played. mindbending to the power of infinite.
2991,2613,Going through my library to support and recommend the games I enjoyed.
2992,2613,PLAY THIS GAME OR YOU IS WEAK
2993,2613,"Starts off simply but drags you in and gets more complicated as you go on, loads of fun"
2994,2613,good game 5/10
2995,2613,BRAIN IS MELT
2996,2613,"i have never in all my life played a puzzle game that so thoroughly explores its own elements as Baba Is You does, nor one so hard, or so satisfying when you finally do figure out the solution"
2997,2613,"As a puzzle game fan, Baba Is You has almost everything that I would appreciate in a puzzle game. The mechanics are quite basic and simple but involve huge potentials to build elements on. And the level design really achieved that by refreshing my understanding of the game again and again. You never know this game enough until you get full achievements unlocked. The game has great difficulties. All hidden contents are fair to obtain and surprising enough. All actions are reversible, which is one of my definitions of serious puzzle games. The equivalence between all game objects is elegant and mind-blowing. And the interaction between levels and menus is my best fun in the game."
2998,2613,Cute game that can get surprisingly challenging. Forces you to think outside the box
2999,2613,"This game is a 101% a recommendIt's got great depth, lots of challenging puzzles, a good difficulty curve, pretty aesthetics.If you like puzzle games, this is likely a game for you."
3000,2613,baba is good
3001,2613,"Baba is you is one of the best games I have ever played. It made me buy more games of this genre, but I don't expect them to come even close to this one. What I hated about many puzzles (not only in video games) is that it boils down to trying every possible combination of moves that you can perform until you come upon the right one. It is boring and it is something computer can and should do for you. This game is not like that. Here you can reason that this kind of tactic won't work, so you won't lose time considering it later. Here you don't solve levels by trying every possible move, but you use your knowledge and ability to reason to guide you all the way. After I find solution I can almost prove that you have to do this level exactly like this (still finding this solution requires an open mind).This game does a lot of things right. The concept is genius. There are lots of rules (words, objects, special cases) which makes for varied gameplay (each area focuses on some specific words or mechanics). There are also lots of levels (more then 200) so you can learn to use all those mechanics (the way progression works you always have some levels to choose from). Sometimes (may be one in 15 levels) I had to look for hints or solution online. Those are really easy to find and most of the time teach me some smart tactic, and most of the time I will use this tactic later (often much later and often in more difficult level). It is also great that you can always undo your moves.Because there are a lot of words developer had to make some decisions how words will interact with each other. I have no doubt that it gets complicated to develop and program something like this, but you as an player don't have to know all this complexity. The game teaches you things that you will need. Often times solution comes when you notice, that you have tools to perform some experiment too see how things will interact. Most of the time result is as you expect, the game is very consistent.The sound and art are also great. I especially love the sound baba makes when it moves like the sound of wet finger rubbing on rubber, it is so satisfying."
3002,2613,Very fun puzzle game that starts with a very simple base and grows into many very interesting interactions and meta puzzles.
3003,2613,Very inspiring!!!
3004,2613,"Probably my favorite puzzle game ever. I can't count how many times my mind was blown by this game.I have a few tips.1. Take your time. If you get stuck, often you'll get the solution after doing something else for a while and coming back to the puzzle.2. This game is great to play with friends. Two heads are better than one, and often each person will come up with a different part of the solution.3. If you think you've finished the game, check your Steam achievements and see if you've collected them all."
3005,2613,"Very, very tricky puzzles, and a lot of interesting mechanics, I would highly recommend a blind playthrough, as the game has so much more than you would expect from an average puzzle game."
3006,2613,"Should have won the most innovative game award, have never played a game before this where the way to win was to change the mechanics of the game itself"
3007,2613,Very fun puzzle game

3014,2613,"""Baba Is You"" is an amazing game.  The puzzles are difficult, the mechanic original, the implementation seamless, and the presentation delightful.  I would highly recommend it!"
3015,2613,It's amazing! The puzzles are so cool and interesting. I can't wait for the level editor to come out!
3016,2613,Yup!
3017,2613,Truly the most mechanically beautiful puzzle game I have ever played. Baba is You challenges how you think the game should work and constantly teaches you to throw away any assumptions you may have about solving a puzzle.
3018,2613,"Great game! Satisfying puzzles with a good difficulty curve. Still haven't finished, very challenging towards the end. Can't wait to bash my head against the wall until I finish this."
3019,2613,This is bar none the single best game of its kind iv played in a decade. its in the same tier as braid but far more challenging to me personally at current age and persistence level.
3020,2612,"Baba Is You (BIY) is one of my favourite games to play so far, and i haven't even finished more than 2 worlds. Even though i suck at it i still find it as one of my favourite games i have ever played. Not my favourite, but its up there. Although, the only negative i can think of atm is that it is VERY challenging for my skill level. But i have seen people beat it so i know it isnt entirely impossible for me to beat it."
3021,2612,GAME ISGOOD

This means, that it requires you to invest heavily in it to get a masterpice feeling.So, either be prepared to do it, or be prepared to get a lesser impression of it.Overall, this is of course a mustbuy and instabuy for a true puzzle lover.  Such games are once in a decade."

3040,2612,"Baba Is You is a puzzle/strategy/logic game where you control the game. Different phases will have different statements that you can change to win the level. Some of the levels are very time consuming and difficult; I've had to look up clues before. Overall, it is a very enjoyable game, and I would recommend it to any strategists looking for a new game"

3048,2612,Extremely well-done puzzle game. Very unique
3049,2612,goob
3050,2612,"Im usually not into puzzle games, but ""Baba is you"" is such a clever pick at thisgenre that I recommend it to everyone."
3051,2612,    
3052,2612,"This game is a process of learning from scratch, utilize your knowledge to solve the problem, and then make new invention of creating new approach solving latest problem and discover new knowledge about the game mechanics."
3053,2612,genuinely makes me feel retarded and sad
3054,2612,Cute little game that makes you use your brain.
3055,2612,"oh. my. god. This is one of the best games I have EVER played! This game is SO worth the money. The concept to this game is very unique and makes this game stick out more than the others. It's fun, challenging, and is very unique!"
3056,2612,Amazingly well designed puzzle game with an outstanding amount of content that doesn't make it feel repetitive. You'll often be rewarded by discovering mechanics you hadn't known were possible.
3057,2612,baba
3058,2612,Very simple mechanics but feels good to solve a puzzle : )
3059,2612,"An incredibly clever game, that never runs out of interesting things to do."
3060,2612,Player near Baba on Computer is Win.
3061,2612,brilliant concept (brain proceeds to explode)
3062,2612,A very inventive and clever puzzle game. I highly recommend it.
3063,2612,
3064,2612,"This game will hurt your brain, but in a good way. The mechanic for the puzzles in this game is brilliant, and the game gives you plenty of time to get used to the mechanics before it throws another curve ball that changes the puzzles entirely. After around the halfway point of the game (for me), almost every puzzle was a struggle, but it was that much more rewarding when you finally solved it. This game will make you think outside the box looking for solutions, and the cute graphics and simple sound effects and background music (I LOVE the background music in this game), make it fun to play, even when you're a bit stuck. If you like puzzle games and coding-style logic, this one's for you."
3065,2612,"Fun, cute and challenging puzzle game. Worth a buy!"
3066,2611,The most innovative gameplay I've ever seen.
3067,2611,This game is trully unique. It requires you to go out of your head and think out of the box. Just the satisfaction each time you solve a puzzle is worth the money.
3068,2611,Even after 25 hours of puzzles Baba Is You continues to delight with new and innovate twists on its base mechanics. 10/10 Puzzle game.
3069,2611,Game is fun and hard and long and worth buying if you like puzzle games or word puzzles!
3070,2611,"Absolutely spectacular puzzle game. If you want a difficult game that'll get your brain turning for a while, play Baba is You!"
3071,2611,
3072,2611,"wonderfully intuitive! you are the master of the rules-but dont let it go to your head... just when you do, you'll be stumped..."
3073,2611,good
3074,2611,Top notch level design
3075,2611,"Great puzzles, creative mechanics. Meta-puzzles are one of my favorite things in puzzle games, and this has quite a few."
3076,2611,great for brain workout but most of puzzles are difficult.
3077,2611,Amazing puzzle game. Will make you think about all the game language you've unconsciously learned.
3078,2611,Innovative sokoban-style puzzle game.
3079,2611,"The concept of changing the rules on the fly is great, but I found the execution to be flawed. What I mean is that the game became so difficult after about ~30 levels that I basically needed to use a guide to solve all of the levels between ~30 and 45. And since there are 200+ levels in this game, it sounds like I would have to spend hours looking up solutions to another 150+ puzzles in order to be able to finish this... Well, no thank you. I'm moving on to something else that I can actually play and enjoy."
3080,2611,"Puzzles are very hard, nigh impossible, but the concept is overall fun, the portion of proceeds donating to charity is awful nice, and of course, baba is you."
3081,2611,This game will melt your brain
3082,2611,It's good
3083,2611,Great puzzle and interesting gameplay
3084,2611,"Really challenging, sometimes pretty hard and you may get stuck here or there. May be frustrating for some but as soon as you finish the level, it just feels rewarding.So pretty nice to play occasionally or while you're waiting in queue in another game."
3085,2611,need chinese
3086,2611,Surprisingly deep and thoughtful puzzles. Cute artwork.
3087,2611,"One of the best puzzle games in years.  If you enjoy mind-bending puzzles that are difficult but not unfair, you will like this game a lot.  Don't mind the graphics, and the soundtrack is memorable to boot."
3088,2611,fun
3089,2611,GOTY 2019
3090,2611,"Very possibly the greatest puzzle game ever made. It played with my expectations expertly, led me to incredible leaps of lateral thinking, and contains the most astonishing ""a-HA!"" moments I've experienced in a videogame. Please, for the love of God, try and play it without walkthroughs, hints, or spoilers; discovering the nuances of the game's grammar and really fully loading its rules into your skull is something that has to be done yourself. The overall experience is *transcendent.* I give it a very large number out of 10."
3091,2611,it good
3092,2611,"very intriguing, fun, and a great game overall."
3093,2611,Extremely clever
3094,2611,"[Overview]So Sokoban went home one day to his wife, Programming Game, one day. Later, their child was born. It was unpolished and only had 14 levels, but the concept was so intriguing that it won the game jam it participated in and grew up nice and strong to be a fully, fledged steam game and ""Game of the Month"". Why did it win? How did the game become so popular? Well, to find out, just create the words GOLDUDE is EXPLAIN.[Gameplay]No, I wasn't kidding when I likened this game as a lovechild of programming games and Sokoban. Let me give you a great example: In the tutorial level, you have four things to go on"" WALL is STOP, ROCK is PUSH, BABA is YOU, FLAG is WIN. You may think that's only four elements, but it's actually NINE. WALL can be pushed to make WALL is YOU, Rock can be pushed into ROCK is WIN, Baba can be pushed into BABA is PUSH, etc etc etc and the game will react accordingly with you controlling the walls, able to push Baba anywhere, and running into the wall in order to beat the level.As you can see, this game can get very complicated very quickly, but new words and objects don't get introduced too quickly. You won't be making statements like ROCK NEAR BABA IS SINK AND HAS KEY while making sure the KEY is KEY so the key doesn't change into lava because there's rules stating KEY is LAVA AND DEFEAT and LAVA IS MORE. There gets to be so many objects and words that a few gimmick levels snuck in which made me go ""OOOOOO THATS SO COOL"" multiple times.But... there is a HUGE downside. Unless you don't want to rack up 80 hours played with the vast majority of your time being taken up by you staring at the screen with a slowly dripping stream of drool coming out of your mouth like you're some second-grader trying to instantly learn trigonometry, I highly suggest you push PRIDE into IS NOT HERE and actually ask people for hints. Why do I say this? The pacing is absolutely terrible. You could breeze through two levels in a total of under 25 seconds, then be stuck at the next three for HOURS (You heard me, HOURS. And I mean hours PER LEVEL). Then, once you finally solve those three levels, the next level takes you 10 minutes to solve, the next one 25 seconds, the next two a combined total of 1 hour 45 minutes, the next level 40 seconds.Baba is You is very good at not teaching you the ""tricks""/""techniques"" you need to use in order to solve a good number of the levels in the game. Seriously, There's a lot of moments where I had to look up hints, still be confused, finally have to look up the solution in a video, see the solution, and go ""I WOULD NEVER HAVE EVER (_EVER_) THOUGHT TO DO THE THING REQUIRED IN ORDER TO BEAT THE LEVEL!"" You get taught the function of the words, yes, but that really isn't enough.And stop calling this game ""The Dark Souls of Puzzle Games"". It isn't. You've never even played Dark Souls. Just because a game is difficult doesn't mean it's ****ing Dark Souls.[Music & Sounds]The sounds perform exactly as they need to, with each different sound being memorable, from the ""dull"" movement sound to the dings indicating that a new rule has been established, to the white noise representing something being defeated/melted/broken/whatever. The water splash sound also sounds like a water splash. There's really not much to say about the sounds other than they do their job.The music, on the other hand... I cannot tell you how many times I found myself going to youtube to listen to some of the songs. They're so catchy. While not as varied and eclectic as games like Killer Instinct and LISA the Painful, the chiptuney soundtrack is always a delight to listen to no matter where you are and what you're doing.[Art]There's... really not much to say about the art. Some of my friends would find it cutsy, but I just say that the art performs exactly what it needs to do. It's clear and coherent, I know what everything is, and I like the ""wiggling"" of all the art. It's not really required of a 2D puzzle game to have art so good that you can barely be able to tell it apart from reality.[Final rating]Gameplay: 8/10Pacing: 2/10Music & Sounds: 8/10Art: 6/10OVERALL: 6.5/10Despite my complaints about the pacing, my mind was constantly being filled up with ideas of levels I can make using the soon-to-be-released level editor. Well, that and there were a decent amount of extremely cool ideas that blew my mind. Buy it if you have the money whilst keeping hints and a walkthrough within reach."
3095,2611,Divertido el uso de la logica para resolver cada nivel. Simple y a la vez dificil.
3096,2611,"Great puzzle game! Gfx, music and sounds are pretty basic and cute :3 but it's all about thinking out of the box. This is why game itself becomes really hard so quickly. It has everything that player needs: save slots, undo button, basic settings (you can turn animations and music off when i.e. it all makes you dizzy).Money and time very well spent <3"
3097,2611,10/10 Prolog interpreter simulator.
3098,2611,Turning large parts of the level into you is as hype as it sounds.
3099,2611,"More interesting reviews on  Fenol Baron Approves Curator Page If you put aside the memes and jokes told about Baba Is You (dont think that people are trying to make you laugh, they are nervously trying to joke with pain and despair), then one thing can be said about this game - its so beautiful that it excites I want to put a tear on my cheek. Being in it is like the contemplation of Durer's drawings and prints, with each new viewing revealing to you their sharp, previously invisible faces; hiding small details behind a monumental general idea, requiring maximum attention and immersion from you. The core of the gameplay is as simple as complex - you have a limited area, a few cubes with words that you can move and connect with each other, several things that obey the rules that you will make of cubes. Win it. And this game is all at once. She is programming, she is Sokoban, she is also a destroyer of rules, she is Baba, and all that can be required from an upscale puzzle game.Get ready for the fact that Baba is your girlfriend or boyfriend with whom you live a very long time, and she knows you. She knows literally everything about you. She knows that you are a self-confident puzzle-breaker and will punish you for it. She knows that after the first victories you will certainly try to apply the successfully derived formula for success in further riddles - and will punish you for that. She will respect you for your growing personal mastery, but will not make any concessions for it. She loves you and hates you, will not let you dictate her own rules, but will allow them to be destroyed, creating something delicious. If I believed in a worldwide conspiracy of pyramid-headed medusians, then I would be sure that this is an experiment on the will of a player who loves puzzles. Each riddle here is like a hymn to the beauty of a pure mind, impeccable elegant logic, the charms of not only the solution itself, but also the ability to change something inside your head in the process of gaining it. This game raises the concept of ""insight"" to some simply inconceivable degree, and it seems to me that it stands here even above the dry rational arrangement of the elements of the puzzle on the shelves. You will feel so many times that you are Archimedes screaming Eureka!, that just in case you will get a full bath of water and try to discover some new law.Of course, the creator has invested incredibly much in this game, and this applies to both external and internal efforts. More than 200 puzzles of the highest quality, each of which can be proud of, a magnificent understanding of human psychology, the constant introduction of some kind of novelty into the game, the game does not stand still. Honestly, give this game a workshop for creating levels, and it will live forever, thanks to the crowds of creators who will make new puzzles. This game is ruthless, it breaks with its complexity, but it's worth it, because you always know that even beyond an infinitely complex riddle there is an elegant solution, you just need to change something in your head. If you like puzzles even minimally, then this game should be taken even without any discounts, since its price is very affordable, for its uniqueness it deserves maximum attention."
3100,2611,"Fun and challenging puzzles, innovation at its best. If you like puzzle games, this one is definitely for you."
3101,2611,"Fun mind twisting game.  No performance issues that I saw, and lots of content.  Puzzles are creative and not a slog.  No plot though, sadly.  Game is worth the price, imo."
3102,2611,Another good gem.
3103,2611,Really good video game but I'm too dumb to figure out the puzzles
3104,2611,Best puzzle game ever
3105,2611,"First off I really do like the concept of this game, it starts off really well and has quite a few good moments, but it has some issues.1. Maybe its just me, but the difficulty spikes way too quickly. World 1 wasn't an issue, world 2 was a bit more complex. But a few more worlds in and it just got way too complicated. For the record I beat Portal 2 and only got stuck once or twice so I wouldn't say I'm bad at puzzle games. (Steam's achievements show the player drop off rate as the levels go on quite well)2. The creator *really* likes to update existing levels. Occasionally its because a level was too hard so he made an easy version and made the original an ""extra"" level or maybe there was something that gave the player an idea of a false solution. But 95% of the time the changes he makes either make it more complicated for no reason or remove an alternative, although clever, solution. In worlds 5+ I'm getting stuck on every second level, but I don't want to just search the exact answer, so I've used hint guides when I need them. But now they're all outdated because of the level changes and therefore the hints often aren't useful anymore. This also applies to the solution videos on YouTube (Thank god for comments describing the new solution). I get why you'd remove unintentionally easy solutions, but most of the time I see this where the patched solution was as clever/complex as the intended version. It feels like the dev has a mentality of ""There must only be one solution (Minus *those* levels that obviously have more than one)"" and it gets really frustrating.3. Spoilers for true end: Eventually you unlock Overworld-8 then 9 and 10. I was playing 9 and was messing around and I made ""LEVEL IS BABA"". Then I get sent back to the world map and level 9 is baba. First off, I kinda knew at some point something would happen on the world map, but I did not expect this and was pleasantly surprised. However I realised there was another exit, but I could no longer play the level because it is BABA. At this point the game had already saved so I couldn't ""undo"" and hence I was forced into either the Finale level or world ???. I wish there was something there to make it more likely I'd get the other solution first or some way to ""undo"" progression. Not a huge complaint, but was a little bit sadAt this point I'm just going to stop playing and watch the rest of the game online since I'm now constantly stuck. Such a shame since I really wanted to enjoy this."
3106,2611,"Very good game, really hard for dumb brain like me. But with good help from smart guys this game gives real good sense of achievement :D"
3107,2611,I like how creative the levels can be in this wonderful and wordy game. It really improved my grammar and literacy skills! Would recommend! 5/7 with fluffy riceI disliked how I could have even programmed this game and did not think of this idea. I am a noob programmer btw. Definitely not salty.
3108,2611,"Baba Is You should be great puzzle game but ends up not, because it fails with teaching you the rules. Too many times I was looking for solution after giving up and discover some new rule I had no idea about. And as a programmer I live and breathe logic and abstraction.At least now I know what makes Portal and The Witness so great."
3109,2611,"Makes you think outside the box. Fun for all ages, for sure."
3110,2611,this is a difficult but fun puzzle game!
3111,2611,It's honestly one of the *absolute* best puzzle games I've ever played. It really gets your mind thinking about how logic works.
3112,2611,This puzzle game kept me entertained for hours upon hours and is such a well crafted and difficult game.
3113,2611,"Is good game, its clever. more clever than me even.  game make angry but game is alright in the end.  game and i have game together about who is husband and now it is game. thank you game"

3117,2611,One of the best puzzle games ever made. Full stop.
3118,2611,Every level in this game really makes you think outside the box. Finding a solution is always rewarding in this game.

3124,2611,"The game is an absolute masterpiece. Even from the very first level that you play, the game lets you know exactly how amazing it is. The main idea is extremely innovative, and works too good.[GAME] is [AWESOME]"
3125,2611,Awesome
3126,2611,"Very inventive and creative puzzler. All the information is laid out before you, and it doesn't try to tell you how to do things."
3127,2611,Great puzzles and lots of them. It melts your brain somtimes
3128,2611,Brain is flat
3129,2611,cool game
3130,2611,"Puzzle game with an interesting new mechanic. Some levels are very challenging, but none (so far) are unfairly difficult. You need intelligence rather than skill to solve them. Would appeal to IT techies and people who like logic puzzles."
3131,2610,BABA IS GAMEIS GOOD
3132,2610,this game makes me feel like a friggin idiot but it is fun and has good puzzlesnice

3138,2610,Great concept and design!!!

3145,2610,"This game breaks your brain in a good way.  This is up there with Portal, Braid, Talos Principle, and The Witness for teaching me new ways to think about approaching puzzles.  Every puzzle solved was fantastic.This game is not easy though.  Prepare yourself."
3146,2610,"game good, it's just that my brain hurts now"

3152,2610,Good logic puzzle/brain teaser game
3153,2610,"Good puzzle game that makes you think outside the box, literally."
3154,2610,Forces you to think hard. It really feels satisfying solving puzzle and does well at making you feel smart. Very clever game mechanic were you manipulate text to change the rules of the game.
3155,2610,"By far the best puzzle game I have played. The puzzles can get annoyingly hard in later levels and this makes finding the solution really satisfying. Don't expect a game where you can get through the levels smoothly, you will fail and you will want to come back next day. Don't skip on this game if you are up for a challenge."
3156,2610,"Best puzzle game of the decade. Completed it twice, would recommend to everyone."
3157,2610,fun game
3158,2610,My brain hurts but it's a masochist so that's fine
3159,2610,Haven't played much at the time of this review bu this is a really good puzzle game!

3161,2610,"AGH MY BRAINSo basically what they did was they saw block pushing puzzles you'll sometimes see in pokemon, zelda, etc and they said ""WEAK.""so they turned block pushing puzzles up to 11 and made a decently fun and challenging puzzle game out of itstrongly recommend for any fan of puzzle games or folk who think block pushing puzzles are easy/the worst10/10 would accidentally make baba not me again"
3162,2610,"I'm too dumb for this game, played about 25% of it and it makes no sense."
3163,2610,"Pros:+cute+funny+pretty+clever and original+very satisfying when you solve that one levelCons:-Puzzle games may not be for everyone-This game will bamboozle you sometimes----Tips From My Experience So Far:----Some puzzles will be easy and some will be pretty hard. Pay attention to how the game works.Be sure to have a guide with HINTS to give you a little bit of help on some really tricky puzzles.Otherwise, re-do other puzzles or skip around the levels. Use solutions as your final straw.Don't play this game when tired or frustrated, it makes it harder. Be sure to eat and drink to getyour brain fueled and ready. Sometimes thinking about a puzzle before going to bed can help youthe next day.Dont binge this game!---------To conclude, 10/10 Recommend if you like puzzle games"
3164,2610,"""Get Baba Is You,"" my wife said. ""It looks so cute and fun!""It's all fun and games until you've spent hours on a single puzzle, trying desperately to figure out how to bend the rules of reality to your will all for that sweet feeling of finally figuring it out. The game look innocuous at first, the puzzles are simple and Baba is adorable. Then WALL IS YOU and suddenly everything you thought you knew is turned on its ear and that's when it all goes south.I love it. I love this game. I do not love how stupid it makes me feel. 11/10 puzzler."
3165,2610,Surprisingly difficult and requires creativity. Its hard even though there are multiple ways to solve the levels. Needs dedication but is worth the effort.
3166,2610,Best puzzler I've seen.Non-linear map helps A LOT here -- otherwise I would've started reading guides and walkthroughs instead of switching to different areas to relax my brain.
3167,2610,is fun

3169,2610,baba hav big brainbaba is me:)
3170,2610,"Baba is you, game is win and fun, must play"
3171,2610,Possibly the most creative puzzle game I've ever played.
3172,2610,"Very challenging but not unfair, and the graphic style is lovely."
3173,2610,One of the most innovative and challenging puzzle games in recent years! Some of the levels will drive you mad which is a big part of the charm this game have.
3174,2610,Very solid puzzle game
3175,2610,yes
3176,2610,Very clever little game
3177,2610,Baba is THINK and WIN
3178,2610,"A work of Art, it just needs more of an audience."
3179,2610,Promising start to interesting game. It feels like a Vector Space demonstrator.
3180,2610,"Baba is you breaks the boundaries of ""puzzle game."" The premise is so simple yet it has over 200 unique and memorable levels, all of them exploring new ideas and remarkable complexity. There is nearly infinite potential for expansion and the modding community is brimming with extra content. Just to warn this game seems simple but it quickly becomes difficult and requires out-of-the-box thinking, and this game is not all that it seems. ANYTHING you tell the game to do with its own rules, it can do."
3181,2610,"I generally consider myself to be quite good at lateral thinking.  But this game has me doubting myself.Baba Is You is a fantastic turn-based puzzler, with a very interesting mechanic.  The rules for each level are dynamic, entirely determined by the ""sentences"" written out in text on the game board.  For example, the eponymous sentence ""Baba Is You"" allows the player (You) to control the sheep character (""Baba"") on the game board.  By moving your character, you can push into words on the board to rearrange them, thus forming new sets of rules in order to beat the level.  10/10 would definitely recommend."
3182,2610,"Nice open-ended puzzle solving. Answer always feels personal, unlike most puzzle games where it just feels like you figured out what the dev wanted you to do.Game is Good."
3183,2610,"It's a super clever game that forces you to think outside the box to solve its puzzles. And that type of thinking comes with a very satisfying payoff when you finally conquer a difficult challenge. Definitely one of the best, if not the best, puzzle games I have every played. Totally worth the price too!"
3184,2610,Great logic puzzle game that makes you think in ways you normally don't.
3185,2610,baba is fr*ckin sweet............
3186,2610,"If you're looking for a unique and challenging puzzle game, you're definitely gonna have to check this game out!The concept of Baba Is You is actually quite simple, within each level the rules of the level is constructed from  words that appear as moveable items. Move the words around to create new rules to your advantage to finish the level. For example if the words BABA IS YOU appear beside each other you play as the character Baba, but if you were to move around the words to say ROCK IS YOU you would instead begin to play as the rock (or rocks) in the level. If some words says FLAG IS WIN you win when you reach the flag, move them to say WATER IS WIN and you win when you reach the water, and so on. While the idea is simple the levels in Baba Is You are generally very well designed and vary in difficulty from a few minutes of pondering to several hours of head scratching.Throughout each new World in the game you also get introduced to a surprinsingly big amount of new concepts and rules (words) that constantly have you rethink how the game is supposed to be played.I very much recommend this game but bear in mind: This game is VERY challenging. You will certainly make it through the first levels without much trouble but sooner or later the game will show its real face to you. If that seems like your thing, go ahead and buy it!"
3187,2610,GAME IS META
3188,2610,"Baba is you stands as one of the most intelligent, original, and clever games I have ever played. For a game that asks the player to leave all of their expectations of how a game should work behind, it still manages to subvert those changed expectations and deliver something truly original beyond its initial premise."

3200,2609,Amazing game.
3201,2609,Made my brain hurt. In a good way.
3202,2609,I didn't think a game like this would be as entertaining as it is. If you are a fan of head-scratching puzzles and are up for a challenge then get it.
3203,2609,neato.
3204,2609,ots googf
3205,2609,"Extremely simple base idea, amazingly complex levels. I recommend Baba Is You to anyone and everyone who loves puzzles and tinkering with logic operators. Learning a new game ""rule"", [finally] getting the solution to an impossible-looking stage, completing each level - it all feels very satisfying.The graphics are very charming in their simplicity, too."
3206,2609,Challenging! Innovative!
3207,2609,Idiot is you
3208,2609,"First levels give you the wrong impression that the game is a sandbox with multiple ways to reach the goal. This, however, is not completely true, and the further you go, the fewer correct solutions levels have. Apparently, the developer even removed the solutions they didn't like as ""unintended"" via patches. If i knew about this design philosophy earlier, i would not have bought the game."
3209,2609,"Huh, it's actually innovative. That's a nice breath of fresh air."
3210,2609,"Baba Is You is fun, but  is it confusing, that or i'm  dumb"
3211,2609,94 puzzles in and it was worth the price after 20 puzzles
3212,2609,My professor told me that if I like puzzle games then I will like Computer Science.*Played Baba Is You*Changed Major to Computer Science. Me is CS.
3213,2609,"The mechanics are well thought out and the game makes you feel as if you have multiple ways to get the solution without needing to follow a strict pattern. Great game, great puzzles."
3214,2609,A very enjoyable puzzle game that makes my head hurt in a good way
3215,2609,"I like idea of the game in general. Some of the texts' functionality were designed to be very fun and amusing when played. This also means that the game gets to a really high level of difficulty further down the line, which makes me experience the shame when i have to look up the solutions to 2 levels in a row."
3216,2609,game is good
3217,2609,This is quite possibly the most unique and mind-bending puzzle game there is.
3218,2609,rly fun game very outside the box. if you have never played a puzzle game before. play this one.

3226,2609,Uses some fun out-of-the-box thinking that makes me think of Portal. Not sure why. Awesome game. Even my girlfriend likes it and she has only ever played Mario Kart.
3227,2609,too hard
3228,2609,"An actual nomic, which is rare in itself, and a well-crafted one at that.  Some of these levels will break your brain, but you'll feel like a complete genius once you figure them out."
3229,2609,"Baba is you is an great and unique puzzle game, but that much is apparent if you have read any other review. My praise for the game is the same as most; great idea, great controls, great execution, great levels, and baba is cute."
3230,2609,LOVE the concept and the consistincy of the aesthetic and rules. It may be better to have hints in case one comes to a stopping point.

3242,2609,"Great, satisfying, funny puzzle game!"
3243,2609,BRAIN IS MELT
3244,2609,Very nice. I like very much.
3245,2609,This is the game of the year for 2019 for just about anyone that has played it.  it's fantastic.  I played through it on switch first bought it again just to support the game.  If you want games that play with the form of being a game and is amazingly fun.  It is for gamers that understand or have played a lot of games.  puzzles get harder particularly towards the end but it's rarely frustrating because there is no punishment for failure and there's a nice undo button.  Even if you do not generally like puzzle games beyond portal and other main hits this game will be worth price of admission.
3246,2609,"I've barely played Baba is You because I need to turn my brain off for a good 30 mins after each level. It's the best puzzler I've ever played in one specific aspect: the puzzles are clearly solvable, and you feel amazing when you work out how to solve them. There's not really any hand-holding, but all of the information you need is in front of you. You just then have to divine how to use that information in a useful way.10/10 would feel stupid again"
3247,2609,This is an incredible abstract - change the rules in real time and continually stretch your brain to come up with new ways to solve these puzzles.
3248,2609,Game is good.
3249,2609,"This game breaks the rules of how games work in lots of fun ways and makes the player feel real clever coming up with nonsense ways to solve puzzles. Cute game with interesting mechanics, would recommend."
3250,2609,great puzzle gamegreat pixel artgreat soundtrack
3251,2609,This is one of the most amazing and innovative games I have played. I do not understand how that didnt receive the most innovative game award this year.
3252,2609,"Baba Is You is a wonderful puzzle game where you, the player, determine the rules of the game by moving around text (similar to the card game Fluxx).  You can make object push-able, pull-able, open, shut, stop,...  The list goes on and on, and I haven't finished the game yet.  It takes a lot of thought to solve most levels, and sometimes the solution is easier than you think.  I like the simple graphics because they don't detract or distract you from the game itself - the puzzles.  If you like puzzle games that really make you think, you'll love this game."
3253,2609,It starts out easy and becomes quickly confounding! Lovely puzzle game of my favorite sort.
3254,2609,This game is so novel and clever and I bought both PC and Switch version of the game at the full price. Still worth it.It's also very challenging so I only pick it up when I'm very bored and spent averagely 15 mins to clear a single level. I don't know when I can finish the game.
3255,2609,This melts my brain. I love it.
3256,2609,"Best puzzle game of the decade, absolute brain melter!"
3257,2609,Really fun puzzle game that's not too easy but also not too hard. It's very different and you have to keep an open mind playing each level. I've put 14 hours into this game and I'm still not finished with it.
3258,2609,"Great game, also a really good way to introduce people to gaming."
3259,2609,"While it is a unique twist on puzzle games, which is why I wanted to try it out. This game gets very difficult fairly quickly, and wasn't what I was expecting. If it had a more gradual difficulty curve I'd probably enjoy it a bit more, but I'm stuck fairly early on and I can see on the world map there's a lot more content I'll never unlock without cheating.I tried to get a refund for this game, but because I had spent a few hours bashing my head against the same 3 levels that I had available Steams automated ticket response was a straight up NO because it was over the 2 hour limit play time. Over all frustrating experience with this game and steam."
3260,2609,"This is a great puzzle game that is fun to play with other people and muck around in. It gets pretty challenging very quick, but is worth experiencing by anyone who finds the core conceit interesting."
3261,2609,Genius.
3262,2609,"real challenging, although i may just be dumb."
3263,2609,"After playing for a day, I've addicted three friends to this game; excellent."
3264,2609,Great puzzleUnlike any other
3265,2609,I did a little 'first look' video on this game.https://youtu.be/kOQ3uyMO_y0I've had a great deal of fun solving the puzzles thus far. Any game where you get to play with the way the game functions captures my imagination.
3266,2609,what
3267,2609,"Great puzzle game that will keep you entertained for hours. The puzzles start simple to teach you the basic rules and then the later levels start to get ridiculous. Super unique idea for a game, highly recommend"

3276,2609,A very innovative puzzle game. The trailer makes it obvious what's special about it. I haven't finished the game yet (I think I might be around 15-20% in?) but I already got my money's worth out of it.

3290,2609,"This game has broken my mind. Possibly the hardest puzzle game I've ever played, but it's still incredibly fun and a great way to pass the time."
3291,2609,Very clever game.
3292,2609,Fun times
3293,2609,"This has to be one of the most innovating games I've ever played. The controls are smooth, the graphics are really well done, and the amount of levels is awesome. I only bought this because my friend told me to, and I have no regrets about it. Great Job Nolla Games."
3294,2609,Super clever. A simple concept that can be taken very far
3295,2609,"This game is really really Awesome! It is the first game that had the ""WHOA"" effect on me after Portal 1. Core game mechanic is extremely interesting and well executed. Game pacing and difficulty curve is great. Each level teaches you just one more important lesson. Most of the levels have multiple satisfying solutions. Overall just grate puzzle game. Well done."
3296,2609,Fun puzzle game!
3297,2609,"Baba is Me, is You?"
3298,2609,"Never thought I'd be into a puzzle game but this game is awesome. Really gives me Earthbound vibes with the OST. The first island's track alone is enough to make me want to keep playing this game through. The OST is very ambient and doesn't take away from the gameplay, instead enhancing it and making your tireless search for the answer to each level more meaningful. It gets hard at times, and you'll be really tempted to search up answers sometimes: but all in all each level teaches you something new about the game or tests you on your knowledge of the game's logic or mechanics. The game design is excellent and it'll immerse you once you understand the game's fundamentals. Levels often have multiple solutions, making the game super replayable if you're into that. Overall, having a blast with the game. Would recommend. Gets a 9/10 for me."
3299,2609,"Yes. If you like to be angry at yourself, your computer, your keyboard, and anything that comes in your way like a teenager on a Nintendo for the next 30 hours of your life, then yes, I do recommend this game. I am a programmer, and pride myself in not being a f**ing dumba**, but this game beat my logic sense. And now I am mentally aligning cars at junctions. I am totally messed up. Scarred for life.  And life is empty now that I finished it. I have no purpose no more. 100/10 stars. Will lose control.Will become addicted. Will become Baba. Baba is you."

3310,2609,"This game is an amazing puzzle game, and the only puzzle game I've ever gotten into. Some levels are really difficult, but when you finally realize one thing- it all comes together."

3320,2608,"Baba Is You is one of the most innovative games of not only 2019, but of all time.  The manner in which the game unfolds in front of you is a sight to behold.  Each level uses what you have already learned and adds to it in ways that you will not always see right away.  Many times, you will bash your head into a level attempting to use what you are sure is the solution, only to realize 30 minutes later that you were going about it all wrong.  Once you have this ""A-Ha"" moment, you will likely complete the level in seconds.Baba Is You should be played by any one who enjoys puzzle games, and can be enjoyed by any one.  To achieve the greatest amount of joy from this game, I would highly recommend that you avoid guides at all costs.  Using a guide will make this game trivial and you will miss out on some of the greatest feelings of accomplishment you can get.  If you have ever wanted to know what it feels like to complete a Dark Souls game, but don't have the time or skill necessary, this game will let you know what it feels like."

3333,2608,This game is delightful! It also hurts my head
3334,2608,"An incredibly clever puzzle game about redefining the very meanings of the objects in the world, except those meanings are themselves objects, too. It's kind of like if Sokoban had more lateral thinking involved. The concept is good and interesting, but the genius puzzle design is what really makes the game - it constantly forces you to apply the concepts you've learned in ways that totally break all the patterns you hadn't figured out how to see past yet. And then sometimes it follows that up with a new version of the puzzle that's almost identical, but with a key element removed, which means you have to find some wholly other way to accomplish the same thing that already seemed impossible the first time.Might be my new favorite puzzle game that isn't Portal."
3335,2608,good game
3336,2608,Great premise for a game but the puzzles can get really difficult quite quickly. Only get this game if you're really into mind bending puzzles.

3344,2608,Un bon jeu de casses tte trs varis.
3345,2608,"Baba Is You joins the illustrious ranks of Braid, FEZ, and The Talos Principle as an excellent puzzle game with a unique relation to its own level structure. Considering its central mechanic involves rewriting the rules of each area, this status may be baked in to the premise, but I guarantee that you are not prepared for just how far the gameplay boundaries will be stretched. I went in expecting a funny little diversion, and instead I got an expansive and humbling existential trip.Between the puzzles that rely on quirks of the behavioural engine and the quickly-rising complexity, Baba Is You can be shockingly difficult. I will admit with zero shame to using a guide on several levels, simply because I needed to see what inventive and/or mind-blowing idea the game would throw at me next. It is, of course, not the best-looking or best-sounding product on the market (although its much better at the latter than the former), but its impressive that a such an experimental game even works, let alone works this well, so its a small price to pay.Score: 8/10https://www.imlgames.com/baba-is-you/"

3364,2608,The most innovative gameplay.
3365,2608,"This game obviously has very novel mechanics. If you want to see what is possible within this game then you should buy it right now. However the level design is clumsy - you'd be tempted to imagine a game about breaking rules and exploring possibilities, but in practice it feels like the designer is trying so hard to outsmart you, to make sure that all the puzzles are virtually single solution, that two things happen:1. It takes a lot of mental effort just to work out which parts of the level are relevant and which parts are just blocking your exploits2. Most of your time spent playing involves discovering genuinely creative near-solutions, immediately followed by the anticlimax of one of those exploit-blocking obstacles. You effectively need to 'solve' a puzzle 3 or 4 times just to find the solution that the designer will allow you to use.Genius mechanics, and a great medium for learning what can be done with them, but a very unsatisfying puzzle game."

3400,2608,"amazing game, absolutely love it"
3401,2608,Baba is you is a fun game that makes you think
3402,2608,"Baba is hardLevels is interactingGame is goodYou is fun*(Baba Is You is one of the best puzzle games I've played through out the years, Sure the game is difficult, but when you complete each interacting level, you get a sense at later levels of ""Why didn't i see that before"" I would highly recommend the game to anything up for a challenge, I really like this game, worth the money)"
3403,2608,"The game is incredibly unique in that it's a puzzle game that CONSTANTLY makes you think outside of the box. Each puzzle is small and simple, but very deep in what you can do. You can change the logic of the puzzle, which is the puzzle itself.No game really makes you think outside the box and abuse the logic like this one. It's also very unique style of puzzle as the goal is to make the logic say you have won under the state of how things are.Absolutely fascinating game that I can't recommend enough."
3404,2608,One of the best puzzle games I've ever played
3405,2608,"An absolute surprise!if you like puzzles give this gem a try :)P.S: It's fun also to co-op, meaning: More than one person trying to solve the complicated ones."
3406,2608,"Game's a lot of fun. For the amount of puzzles there are, only a small number of them feel 'unfair'. Feels good to figure out the 'technique' and you actually build a bad of tricks that can be used for most of the puzzles."
3407,2608,b r a i n  i s  y o ui sd e fe a t

3410,2608,not very often you see a completely new mechanic in a gamealso cool soundtrack
3411,2608,One of the best puzzle games I've ever played.
3412,2608,"BABA IS YOU AND GAME IS FUN ANDCLEVERGAME IS MOST INNOVATIVEIS GREATLOVE IS YOU AND not HATELEVEL IS PUZZLEIS HARDBRAIN IS not SMARTI WANT MOREnot LEVEL IS MINDBLOWN and LEVELREVIEW IS not ENDnot INTRO IS REVIEW:I have never really played a proper puzzle game before ( I'm more of a dark souls kinda duck), so I wasn't sure if i would like this one, and oh boy let me tell you I don't just like BABA IS YOU, BARVAZ IS ADORE IT! The mindblowing puzzles never failed to impress me and I loved cracking through them. My only neetpick with this game is that sometimes the solutions or kinda wierd and felt kind of unfair (looking at you META 12 and that ice/lava level). SCORE IS 10/10 quacks"
3413,2608,Amazing puzzle game for all ages.
3414,2608,"Like any proper brain-puzzle game, Baba Is You can make you really smart in one level and really dumb in the next.  Its cute design and chill music gives you a sense of relaxation throughout the gameplay and is easy to come back to if your head needs a break.  I love how despite the complicated requirements sometimes I can feel my mind expanding as I play.  Highly recommend!"
3415,2608,"great puzzle game, it makes you think out of the box"
3416,2608,"Some of the puzzles are really hard, but fun. Sometimes it's quite challenging."
3417,2608,"Baba is Pain and Win. Time is Sink. Solution is Simple. Baba is Not Pain. Baba is Love.  (Translation: This game is amazingly challenging, but once you figure out the puzzle, it seems so damn simple, you want to kick yourself for not seeing it right away. It's also one of those puzzle games where you go to the bathroom/shower and somehow the answer just appears before you, usually in the way of saying ""What, can I Do that?!""Sure, you COULD cheat and see the solution online. But each video is ~:30-1:00 minute long, making it seem that much easier to just figure out yourself. Because hey, it can't be THAT hard if the video is that short, right? ...Right???)"
3418,2608,"Baba is love, Baba is life.Loved getting a puzzle first try. Loved coming back to a puzzle later with fresh eyes and getting it. The journey is often worth more than the destination, and what you find along the way will surprise and amuse you. Lots to play here so even when you do have to leave a puzzle for later there will always be more to do. The game is pretty good at teaching its mechanics by scaling up difficulty, though every once in a while you'll need to think in a completely different direction than you think, which can be frustrating at first (though ultimately rewarding when you do get it later)Best played without a strategy guide, or at least one that starts with hints before giving away the solution."
3419,2608,this game gave me a brain aneurysm
3420,2608,"Game of the year, Its been a while since I've  been surprised by new game mechanics, this game has a lot of innovation on its core mechanics plus some of the levels design are amazing, I hope the team who made this game continue with this path. 10/10"
3421,2608,"I don't normally play puzzle games, but this one has really resonated with me. This game presents logic puzzles based not on just following the rules, but also learning exactly what they mean, so you can bend them to achieve your goal. I'm 5 hours in with two fully completed islands. Some puzzles are trivial and you can solve many in a row, but I'm running into more and more puzzles that take me a single session to figure out. I.e, once I beat it, I'm done playing for the day.Overall, I would say it's worth a buy if you're into this kinda thing. It's a mind bender for sure."
3422,2608,Topzera.
3423,2608,Baba is best game
3424,2608,too hard for me :(
3425,2608,veri good
3426,2608,"I love this game so much that I changed all of my social media's usernames so that they contain ""Baba Is"" after the first hour of my playthrough. Truly one of the most innovative puzzle games released in the past decade.Baba is GOTY."
3427,2608,"A puzzle game that will have you relearn the rules every puzzle. Very thoughtful. I purchased for $11.99 and three hours in, I have beaten the lake area. Some of the puzzles are so clever and this is absolutely worth your time if you enjoy puzzles."
3428,2608,Baba is joy
3429,2608,"Fun, difficult and mind breaking game."
3430,2608,Great puzzle game! Really enjoying it! :D
3431,2608,Holy  I have like zero IQ
3432,2608,good
3433,2608,The puzzles are so unique and challenging. I'm having a blast with this game so far!
3434,2608,"One of a kind brain teaser that keeps you coming back. The simplicity of the soundtrack and design is beautiful, but the ability of Arvi to create hundreds of puzzles which all felt different is the real gem here. If you don't have to cheat on a few levels in the endgame, you should be very proud."
3435,2608,Mind exercised and is exhausted.  Only if women were interested in my mind's muscle.  Oh.  They are.  Well this game is good for attracting mind loving women.  Can recommend then.
3436,2608,IQ Rollercoaster
3437,2608,This is probably one of the hardest games I've ever played. I love it.
3438,2608,Neat.
3439,2608,"Fantastic and unique puzzle game. Some levels require out of the box thinking. Game has 200 levels which will burn tens of hours of your time. Needs a level editor (which currently is beeing worked on), with it I believe the game will live for a long time and have even more content. Other than I woldn't change a thing in it, it's just that good."
3440,2608,baba is you and win
3441,2608,Sentences good. Puzzles hard. Music soft. Baba is friend.
3442,2608,"Great fun, I can only play when i'm fully awake though. Challenging and fantastic"
3443,2608,"I don't even play video games, let alone puzzle games, but this is certainly the best puzzle game, and up there with the best games of all times. Difficulty scales extremely well, the level design is top notch, and always rewards players when they ""get"" the trick. Great game."
3444,2608,good puzzle game

3449,2608,It has a character that looks like a sheep
3450,2608,baba is still good
3451,2608,"baba is not me, dont ever try to say that again to me if you want continue to be apart of my instagram gang, ps the makers of this game assumes the wrong stuff. i also heard my friend say the n word and now its time to find out where he lives irl and im gonna do some canadian justice."
3452,2608,A quality puzzle game with a challenging but worthwhile difficulty spike. 8/10
3453,2608,"I haven't beaten it, but its beaten me. I've never felt so ashamed of looking up a walk through for some levels just to realize how simple the solution was."
3454,2608,Fantastic little puzzle game - easy to learn but hard to master just like any good game should be.
3455,2608,ME IS DUMB
3456,2608,"Baba Is You     Fun and creative, I first saw this and thought ""heh, another Sokoban game and it's very costly for that kind of game"" I wonder why its getting nominated for Game Award? so I give it a shot and WOW that absolutely cool game. The game is very simple you will (mostly) start playing as a cute creature called Baba and trapped in the room with other object like ""Rock"", ""Key"", ""flag"" etc. and the text like ""Baba is you"" that means you controlling Baba with other text like ""Rock is push"" so rocks can be pushed and the text ""Win"" you can push the texts to make new rules by combination other texts to change the rule like making ""Rock is win"" and you just simply walk into any rocks in the room to beat the level.Sound simple but some levels are insanely challenging and creative sometime you just have to think outside the box.In conclusion     this game is hand drawn art style puzzle that you can change the rule by make new combination of words. its creative and original puzzle game, Its surprisingly hard than you think but fun to solve. also have a good soundtracks too!"
3457,2608,"imo very original puzzle game,"
3458,2608,"Wow, this guy is a great game."
3459,2608,"The game starts strong with possibilities and multiple ways of solving each room. Unfortunately it quickly devolves into tightly  designed puzzles with no solutions outside of the intended. This replaces the moment of eureka, with the frustration of correcting a misspelled word by adding and removing letters until the auto-corrector approves it. You know the word since most rooms are very obvious in their solution just not in what order the letters come."
3460,2608,amazing
3461,2608,Nice
3462,2608,It really requires you to think OUT of the box
3463,2608,"I recommend this only if you are good at puzzles, or can withstand your brain melting for periods at a time."
3464,2608,Very clever like C++ but makes me want to kill myself less 10/10
3465,2608,"Simple idea, great puzzles."
3466,2608,"Very unique puzzle mecanics, would recommend to anyone looking for chalenging puzzles :)"
3467,2608,"This game really makes you think, and I really like it! It has tons of levels, and a level editor is coming soon! (you can actually use the hidden level editor by putting a script file in the game folder, but it is very buggy at this point)I definitely recommend this game to anyone looking for a tough but rewarding puzzle game!"
3468,2608,Puzzle game that makes you feel really good when you complete a stage. Plus baba is cute. :3
3469,2608,1 outta 1
3470,2608,Very fun and thought intensive game. One of the best pure puzzle games I've ever played. Highly recommended.
3471,2608,"I could go on about the beautiful nature of this game's mechanics, but for the sake of a Steam review I'll be brief...It's one of the best puzzle games out there. You get chill music, over a hundred fun and confusing (in a good way) levels to work through, and even if you mess up you get to see some funny stuff happen to poor Baba and the world around him.100% worth a buy"
3472,2608,baba is giveth and baba is taketh away
3473,2608,"This game is masochistic tbh, getting you to abuse its ruleset to the MAX and then absolutely turning it inside and out, telling you to break it further, but you can't because you already used up all your moves and -- you know what, just play it"
3474,2608,"A brilliant concept executed well. It's hard, but rewarding"
3475,2608,Its the best puzzel game I have ever played due to it amazing idea and great puzzels. Each one was dificult and new one of my best buys on steam
3476,2608,Family friendly and reasonably well made non-linear puzzle game with high emphasis on propositional logic and thus very suitable and beneficial for children.+ will run on basically any hardware+ small size+ no bugs encountered+ long+ creative+ makes you think- low sound variety- bland and repetitive soundtrack and art style (subjective)- can get frustrating (but also rewarding)- feels like it uses more hardware resources than it should (compared to similar games)- a bit overpriced for what it isI have mixed feelings about this game. I expected to have way more fun but it's done nothing wrong and I would feel bad giving it a negative review. Definitely not a game I'll be returning to after getting all the achievements though. Get on sale.
3477,2608,So simple yet so complex.
3478,2608,Very fun and difficult logic puzzles.
3479,2608,BABA IS YOU I  AM  STUPID (;`)
3480,2608,amazing game.  Reminds me of Chips Challenge for the Atari Lynx.
3481,2608,"I just couldn't click with this game. I like its neat concept of pushing around words to change the rules of the level, but I generally found the execution to be a bit obtuse and overall some of the mechanics of Baba is You just went well over my head. I was looking forward to trying this game out, and if you're very good at these sorts of puzzles then you may enjoy it a lot more than I did. I just found my hours with it to be a bit of a slog. Oh well, you can't like everything I guess."
3482,2608,Cute and clever.
3483,2608,baba is win
3484,2608,This is a literal mind game
3485,2608,"Baba Is You is an incredible 2d puzzle game! It's not only super creative, but it has some extremely intricate and complex puzzles made out of easy-to-understand/straightforward logic-based mechanics that really make you think outside the box! And the adorable pixelly/doodly art style and calm thinking music are just the cherry on top.  <3 love this game! Definetly worth the price."
3486,2608,"A wonderful idea and excellent execution.  Puzzles are challenging and rewarding to solve.  If you are stuck on one, it is easy to do something else and come back.  This is a beautiful game for anyone who likes puzzles with unique mechanics."
3487,2608,"A great puzzle game for those interested in a puzzle game that incorporates problem solving and computer programming concepts. I recommend this game to anyone studying Computer Science and Software or Computer Engineering as it introduces you to some of the basics of logic. For those who have experience already or not, this game is an awesome puzzle game that provides a good challenge and will introduce you to a fun object pushing puzzle simulator.TLDR:BABA IS YOU BABA IS WIN AND GAMEGAME HAS BABA"
3488,2608,BABA IS CUTE AND BABA IS YOUGAME IS PUZZLE AND CLEVERPUZZLE IS OBVIOUS BUT HARDMUSIC IS GOODBUY IS WIN
3489,2608,not nearly as mind-bending as it is purported to be. still one of the best existing puzzle games
3490,2608,"cute lil puzzle game whose adorable artistic style belies a seriously challenging experience. a combination of logic puzzles and sokoban, this is definitely the most original and probably the best puzzle game of 2019"
3491,2608,Best puzzle game I've ever tried.
3492,2608,"Makes me feel like the  I am. Great mechanics, great concepts, great headaches. A great game if you like puzzles. Or want to hurt yourself."
3493,2608,Game is fun and hard.Text is push. Rule is change.Clever is you.Have fun everyone! It's a challenge and a half. I thought I was pretty smart and my brain melts at some of these puzzles.
3494,2608,Help. My brain. It isn't working anymore.
3495,2608,Requires more creativity than any other puzzle game I've ever played.
3496,2608,

3498,2608,A must-play if you like puzzle games.

3500,2608,melts my brain
3501,2608,"I find myself cheating a lot, it gets really difficult pretty fast.Very cute but pretty tricky, lots of different answers to the same problem.A bit too difficult for me though, in the end I find myself losing interest which is a shame because this game seems pretty awesome."
3502,2608,not baba is not goodkeke is great
3503,2607,it good
3504,2607,baba is baba
3505,2607,One of the most satisfyingly difficult puzzle games I have ever played. Wrapping your head around simple mechanics that combine for complex interactions is what it's all about.
3506,2607,"This game has a very comfortable learning curve and simplistic controls, meaning that your ability in beating the game comes from your puzzle-solving skills alone. There is no time limit, but that doesn't make the game easy at all. The mechanics can be hard to wrap your head around in some cases, but they always make sense and follow the same rules. The game is fantastically internally consistent. It's the most creative puzzle game I've played."
3507,2607,awesome concept. the puzzles are hard though
3508,2607,get ready to stare at your screen for 90% of your game time. otherwise amazing game

3514,2607,Haven't played long but this is genuinely one of the best and most unique puzzle games out there.
3515,2607,Sick idea and fun to play. For puzzle lovers.
3516,2607,If you like puzzles then Baba is 100% right for you!
3517,2607,"I fell in love with the concept of Baba is You the moment I saw it.This is by far one of the most original an ingenious idea for a puzzle game I have ever seen. What a breath of fresh air!Don't let it fool you, it's not just a clever concept. The guy who made this game pushed the mechanics to their limit. Everytime you will think you mastered the rules, the game will throw in a new one at you.In essence, Baba is You is a game where you have to bend the rules to solve the puzzles. It starts off pretty simple but it gets insanely complex FAST. I consider myself a pretty logical person, I'm usually good at solving puzzles. This game consistently made me feel STUPID.You will definitely have those ""Ah-ah!"" moments with a lot of the puzzles you solve. There is however a point where certain solutions just feel... Tedious. Solutions that will take a long time to set up, where you're not entirely sure you're doing the right thing and are left with somewhat of a bitter taste when it ends up working.I freaking loved this game. But to my own detriment; I am a completionist of sorts. I went from loving the game to just... Wanting to be done with it. I remained stuck on some earlier levels having no idea what to do and didn't progress for a long time.I found two things that helped a TON in completing the whole game, 100%:1. Look for hints online when you're truly stuck. Do NOT look for solutions, that's the whole point of the game. If you can't solve it, you probably won't be able to solve the next one either. However, sometimes you just need a gentle nudge in the right direction and that's nothing to be ashamed of.2. Consider playing with someone. I turned Baba is You into a co-op game around the 4th world. I never had such a good example of the saying ""Two heads are better than one"". I played through the majority of the game with a friend of mine who's also very logical and it was mind-blowing how differently we solved each puzzles! There where some puzzles I'd solve instantly that he would take a long time to solve and some other puzzles that would leave me completely clueless while he was able to figure them out very quickly.Even still, the later portion of the game got the better of us. It felt sadistic. We were often at our wits' end and just wanted to be done with the game we once loved so much.This game is amazing... But beware! It is unforgivingly difficult and you are much better off playing it in smaller doses. I don't feel like we wasted much time and it took me 60 hours to beat... I expected less than 10.All in all, it's very worth it! Even if you only play through the first world or two."

3521,2607,This will break your brain! Most creative and inventive indie puzzle game that I've seen in a long time. Great retro style music and aesthetics as well.
3522,2607,This is the most fun I've had with brad grammar.
3523,2607,Sokoban-like puzzle game
3524,2607,"This is the most amazing puzzle game I've played. The ability to literally manipulate the rules of the game is completely mind blowing, and through such a simple premise comes a complex and difficult game. It's deceptively simple, and I have a feeling it's going to have a huge impact on puzzle games of the future. This is a game you absolutely want in your library."
3525,2607,Best puzzle game ive ever played
3526,2607,"Baba is You is one of, if not the most creative puzzle games I've ever played. Besides its simple yet ingenious mechanics, almost every level is well-designed and makes you think, an amazing feat for a game with over two hundred levels."

3528,2607,"You want a game that's mentally stimulating? You want a game that'll make you think outside the box?

Baba is You. Game is hard. Game is fun. Review is over."

3531,2607,GA  IS  GOME  --   OD
3532,2607,10/10. I loved getting so angry at levels that I was still thinking about them hours later.
3533,2607,"""Baba is You"" offers an elegant combination of programming puzzles and 2-D spatial puzzles.  While the many rules may interact in unintuitive ways, each individual element of the game is introduced in a clear and interesting manner.  Plus, the puzzles that introduce new mechanics are challenging in their own right -- and the difficulty only ramps up from there.  If you are looking for a casual puzzle game, this is probably not for you.  But, if you enjoyed games like ""Human Resource Machine"" even when you got stuck, I cannot recommend ""Baba is You"" highly enough."
3534,2607,aaaaaaaaaaaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
3535,2607,"A little gem, reminding us, what the one-man-made indie games can be."
3536,2607,Extremely innovative and fun at the same time

3539,2607,Devlishly clever spatial/logical puzzler!
3540,2607,"Innovative game, this is a fun puzzler with programming-like characteristics in the gameplay. Highly recommended for those who like puzzels."
3541,2607,"Pure gold. From start to finish.Makes you feel really stupid in one moment, and really smart soon after.Level difficulty progresses steadily, from 10-minute completions to 10-hour completions.Later levels inside the secret level inside the secret level inside the secret level inside the secret in the map are really, really difficult. Like Dark-Souls-meets-Cuphead difficult. But don't spoil it for yourself, you'll regret it if you don't figure the levels on your own. Even if it takes 2202394 hours."
3542,2607,Baba is good
3543,2607,Great game. Does a lot with a little.
3544,2607,"Baba Is You is a challenging and rewarding puzzle game. Every level ends with a Eureka moment when you finally work out the solution, meaning every level has satisfying moments."

3548,2607, 
3549,2607,"Very innovative concept for a puzzle game. conceptually crisp and polished. Large variety of puzzles, getting quite difficult. Great!"
3550,2607,Most creative and challenging puzzle game made in the last 10 years. Brain too small to finish it.
3551,2607,Really innovative puzzle game that forces you to really think about what previous puzzle games have taught you. A bit frustrating on the harder levels but that's life right?
3552,2607,im too stupid to figure out the puzzle

3561,2607,Amazing puzzle game with very unique mechanisms that will rack your brain real good. You will need logic but above all to think out of the box to hope solving the very numerous and gradually more challenging puzzles.Highly recommended game
3562,2607,I played several levels. I never play something like that. It is so creative. I am impressed.
3563,2607,Baba Is You is one of the most innovative puzzle games I have seen yet. The idea of making the game rules change on the fly like they are is very brilliant. The levels do an excellent job of playing with the game rules. At first glance you would think something that lets you change the rules like this would be easy but once you start playing you see just how hard things can get while the core concept stays simple and elegant. Baba Is You is one of my top favorite games of 2019 and possibly the most innovative game of 2019 only being matched by Slay The Spire.
3564,2607,"puzzle game that's got a unique spin and is appropriately difficult(i only ever really got super stuck on how to do a few levels and had to look them up)There were a few times where there was something you needed to do that had zero indication it was possible (stacking text onto each other being one), but otherwise i enjoyed every minute!"
3565,2607,Baba is hard
3566,2607,"Creative, well designed puzzles, out of the box (perhaps even literally) thinking."
3567,2607,"Baba is you. For the first few levels anyways. Soon, you might be a bug, or Keke, or even some water. Baba is You is one of the best puzzle games I've played. It's got some real tough ones, but worst comes to worst, there are guides for the levels online. Definitely worth picking up. Also, remember, nothing is inherently anything!"
3568,2607,Turns my brain inside out
3569,2607,"The late game gets incredibly restrictive and it ultimately comes down to solving things in the exact sequence the dev came up with, which is disappointing given the premise and the freedom allowed by the early levels that can have as many as five solutions. It's clear that the dev had no idea how to juggle increased complexity along with player freedom as time went on, so what we got instead were simpler levels with arbitrary limitations. Add to that the game's complete inability to explain the tools at your disposal, and you're going to end up solving levels by mistake or looking up the solution only to discover you weren't even aware you could perform the action you were required to do.If you're up for untangling Baba's idiosyncrasy, then you might find this rewarding. But as a puzzle? It's eons away from even coming close to a title like Talos Principle, let alone rival it or outdo it."
3570,2607,I'm so smart i'm so dumb i'm so  smart wow how am i this stupid i am a  GENIUS
3571,2607,"The best praise that I can give this game is that is scratches a puzzle itch like no over. Few games (such as portal) can do that for me but Baba is you is truly the most unique.Baring one puzzle with a method the game doesn't tell you, every puzzle is solvable without the need to look up a guide and easily done so provided you can stick by the games one requirement. You can't just think outside the box you have to be the box(quite literally sometimes), think next to the box and think like that one guy who said"" wow thats a nice looking box"".  My point its very rewarding to solve a puzzle and when it just clicks is the truly the best reward, similar to beating a hard boss.  The phrase innovative gets thrown around a lot right now but this game is actually worthy of that definition"
3572,2607,"Great game, good design."
3573,2607,Its such a well made puzzle gmae if you understand it
3574,2607,BABAISGOOD
3575,2607,good game
3576,2607,"In an FPS, you click and you shoot. You never ask why. In baba is you, You are baba. You are baba because there are blocks that say ""Baba is you"". If you disconnect these blocks, you no longer control baba. With endearing graphics and fantastic puzzles, there is no game I reccomend more. If there is a concept, no matter how innovative, this game already uses it at some point. The game is turring complete, as in, people have made conways game of life. The game is so striking in its depth and so new in its concept. It is overwhelmingly good. Seriously, it is worth triple its asking price"
3577,2607,"I have been a fan of puzzle games for my entire life. I LOVE a challenge. The problem with many puzzle games of this day and age is that most have fallen into a very specific category with a rote formula. You have the classic ""escape game"" of ""get x object to do this thing, find code, walk out door."" You have number and math puzzles galore. You have physics puzzles, where you have to get something to fall JUST the right way. Wash, rinse, repeat. Don't get me wrong, these games all have their special place in my heart, and I do still enjoy them from time to time. But then there came Baba is You.Baba is You does something that I had long given up hope of a game ever doing again. Baba is You has created an ENTIRELY new concept of puzzle. Unique, challenging, but with a simple-to-learn concept, BIY is something completely different. It bends the very idea of the reality of a game, twisting traditional gaming on it's head. All the while, still presenting the same EXACT goal of practically ANY game: Get [YOU] to [WIN]. In so doing, Baba is You has created something precious, and reminded us that there are always new ideas out there in the gaming universe, you just have to find them.10/10, A masterpiece of simplicity."

3584,2607,baba is good
3585,2607,Best puzzle game since Portal.
3586,2607,"Baba Is You is unique. It merges programming puzzles perfectly with sokoban gameplay, and uses it's rule manipulation premise in so many fun and unexpected ways. Top it off with plenty of secrets to find, more than 200 levels, and some lovely art and music, and you have yourself an amazing experience.I'm often the type to give up quickly in puzzle games but the combo of the game's easy to understand logic, gradual introduction to new mechanics, and great presentation, kept me trying to solve levels myself, even as the game got much harder.Baba Is You is my Game of the Year for 2019, my favourite puzzle game ever, in my top 5 games of the decade, and in my top 10 games ever, so I may be a bit biased in saying this, but; you should definitely check out Baba Is You."
3587,2607,"Baba is You is the most inventive, thought out, and impressive puzzle game I have played. Its unwavering adherence to pure logic is a breath of fresh air and doesn't get old thanks to the self-aware, and deceptive level-design. I have rarely seen a game pull off the art of misdirection as masterful as Baba is You. Of course, I will recommend Baba is You, it is easily worth its full price.PS:Screw you, Prison level."

3590,2607,How do you make a game this good?
3591,2607,"Steven's Sausage Roll, in the limited time I played it, felt like a very fat man was silently judging me and occasionally pelting me with Nelson Muntz style ""HA-HA~""s until he got bored of watching me struggle. Baba Is You feels functionally similar to that game - essentially a sliding-block programming simulator - except the person hanging out with me is a cute girl who idly doodles pictures in crayon while I'm thinking, instead of laughing at me. Maybe this comes down to a deeply ingrained inferiority complex; maybe it's purely about knowledge communicated to the player and visual style; but maybe that's enough: one of these games I will never play again, and the other, I will eagerly recommend to my friends."
3592,2607,"I'm so confused, but in a good way"
3593,2607,"Creative, mind bending puzzles. Cute charming graphics."

Also, the guy who makes it is one of the loveliest people I've ever encountered on the Internet, so he deserves all your money for being nice AND a genius."

3609,2607,very good game
3610,2607,Baba goes and is very good and fun!
3611,2606,"Game was fun until the puzzles began ramping up too fast. I had ALOT of issues completing 90% of puzzles after world/island 5. Became tedious and frustrating to be forced to reconcile the sheer number of rules and methods of interacting with the words/objects. Also, floating is a TERRIBLE mechanic IMO. But I'm not a game dev, so w/e."

3613,2606,Fantastic mind of a game!
3614,2606,"Sokoban ++. Same box-pushing, don't-get-things-caught-in-the-corner rules apply.. but instead of just boxes you are pushing *rules* around.I like the subtle, eerie sound/fade effect when you ""die"", the yoshi's island style ""squigglevision"", and unexpectedly pushing rules together in a way you hadn't intended that can sometimes wind up transforming half the screen into flags or unexpectedly make every wall in the game a player character etc. x3"
3615,2606,Very unique game play and challenging puzzles.
3616,2606,"This game makes my brain hurt.It's a lot of fun. Very easy to to play the game, hard to solve the puzzles."
3617,2606,"Quirky, fun, hard."
3618,2606,"A fun puzzle game. I appreciate how it challenges me to think out of the box. The simple graphics don't distract from the puzzle solving, but complement it nicely. The music pieces are well picked to the same effect. (There's one bg music that though atmospheric, makes me kinda nervous, sounding a bit creepy, so I just turn off the sound when playing these levels and I'm good.) I quite enjoyed the wobble effect at the beginning but then turned parts of it off.More pros:- even in later levels, there's easier and harder levels, so you can get some quick successes lateron too and the game doesn't become like hard work.- Replayability :-) There's plenty of levels. After one playthrough I think I could start all over again - it would be fun and (if you don't remember all solutions you found) challenging to do the levels once more :-). (- small game size, can be downloaded even with limited data)"
3619,2606,it be aight
3620,2606,Best puzzle game of the decade. MUST play!
3621,2606,"This game is a great puzzle game which starts out very simple put gets really complex.You can go away and come back to this game whenever due to the easy to learn gameplay and simplistic nature.Though this game is simplistic, the game ramps up in difficulty the more you play, but there is no end to the fun as their are always more levels if you get stuck."
3622,2606,"hard, fun puzzler"
3623,2606,A beautiful puzzle game that constantly forces you to challenge your preconceptions of how puzzles work.

3630,2606,One of the best puzzle games I have ever played. Sometimes puzzles feel rather confusing and non intuitive and while this is part of the games design it really can lead to a game that feels difficult to pick up when impatient. There is clearly a lot of love and extremely complex design involved in this game.

3635,2606,Baba will give you brain worms but in a good way. I have never felt more clever than solving this clear and consistent but completely logical moonthink.
3636,2606,"For reals, one of the best puzzle games I've played.There are a couple of game mechanics that I felt were ""cheap"". The main two were two objects shifting each other to move, and overlapping text to create two rules in one space. It's cool that they work like that, but I felt like it made some of the answers too niche to be enjoyable.Those few inconvenient puzzles however pale in comparison to the overarching magnificence of this game.The only thing that would really make this game better is workshop support. Imagine all the amazing puzzles the community could come up with!"
3637,2606,I would say this is the most innovative game of all time for me.

3640,2606,"This game is genius. This isn't just a weird, gimmicky puzzle game made by some random student. This game will bend your mind in ways you never dreamed of. Its not just ""change the rules so you win the level."" This game takes the idea further into ""Use the rule blocks THEMSELVES to change the rules to win the level."" It is an absolute joy to figure out what each verb does and how to reassemble them to win. And if you're not convinced, Mark Brown from Game Makers Toolkit (YouTube) just recommended this game as the most innovative of the year. You can watch his review if you don't believe me when I say this game is genius. :D"

3666,2606,"Fantastic puzzle game, would recommend to anyone who loves puzzlers"
3667,2606,"Baba Is Epic.The best puzzle game I've ever played, by a long shot. Just the simple idea of ""changing the rules of the game"" is such an innovative concept, but the way Baba pulls it off is simply amazing.Almost every stage in the game features an unique and difficult challenge where you have to think outside the box and play around with the rules a lot, and the way all the objects interact with each other just makes this one of my favorite games of all time.Although, every game has it's problems. In my opinion, some of the levels suffer from kinda bad planning, even if it's only ~1/20 levels, it's still there. And even the ""final"" level suffers from it, which made the level annoying to figure out. Some levels just require something way too specific to be fun to figure out how to beat. Some levels have a good challenge on figuring out what to do, but their setup makes it annoying to execute the idea. And some levels, like the ""final"" one, suffer from having too many rules, which makes the level look way more complicated than it actually is.Overall, I'd definitely recommend this game, although you have to be careful, this game is definitely not for everyone."
3668,2606,Game is good
3669,2606,Really gets you thinking
3670,2606,Baba is Good. Get really  hard real quick so it's no easy puzzler either
3671,2606,"Baba is rad!This game has a lot of clever puzzles, and creative mechanics, that are explored to their full potential! Although a few silly inconsistencies, paradoxes, and gimmicky mechanics, left me incredibly infuriated. When I looked up the solution, it felt like it wasn't even my fault. For example in level Island 12 - Evaporating River, it just doesn't make any logical sense that a cog would sink a skull. It just left me annoyed instead of making making me go ahah, that's pretty smart! A simple name change from Sink to Bomb or something, would have made the premise a lot easier to understand.Don't let those few anomalies put you off the game though, just play it with a grain of salt. An otherwise exceptionally fantastic game, festooned with innovation, left a small bitter taste in my mouth."

3686,2606,"Finally, another puzzle game as whimsically entrancing as Snakebird!"
3687,2606,"One of if not THE best puzzle game I have ever played. The art and music is beautifully simple and adorable which contrasts with how complex the puzzles get. The game is perfectly paced as the games starts simple with core mechanics and each area gives you new words to work with that add new properties constantly spicing up the puzzles once the old ones start to get stale. It forces you to always think outside the box since the most obvious answer usually is not correct, and it is so satisfying figuring out solutions to each puzzle because of this. The late game levels also push boundaries in such clever ways that most puzzle games don't touch, but it makes so much sense with the rules the game sets up. If there's one thing I can fault the game on, it is that some of the mechanics can be hard to interpret at times with how many interactions there are, but figuring them out is also part of the fun. Sometimes it is just as fun to play around with the logic since you can basically do anything the rules allow, so even if it doesn't lead to a solution, some fun things can still happen.In summary, the only way Baba would have:""BABA IS YOU"" HAS FUNISBESTANDHARD"

I can honestly say that I've really enjoyed it so far, being a person who mostly avoids puzzle games entirely.

3711,2605,"This is one of the few puzzle games I can play for a long time without getting bored/stuck and just looking up the solution. It is uncompromisingly logical, and you'll be a good way through the game before you get a complete grasp of how the main mechanics even work, for instance, the game logic's total reliance on turns (e.g. waiting). I'm currently thinking of the level 'Tour', where you need to know that any transformations do not occur immediately, but are queued for the end of the turn. This means that any rules which are opposites, such as Baba is Keke with Keke is Baba, the effect is a flip flop each turn. Look up a walkthrough for this level to know what I mean.That sounds bad, but the truth is that almost every level acts as a tutorial where you can experiment and derive the necessary information. The few many times I did look up a solution (hey, I didn't say I was any good), I immediately understood why it worked, subsequently felt a little stupid, and felt that with more experimentation, I would've figured it out. And of course, the game is designed to teach you its mechanics in manageable pieces.TL;DR This game is ruthlessly logical and I love it for that."

3738,2605,"Excellent puzzle game. Give it a try. Some of the puzzles are very difficult, though."
3739,2605,Piece of art.
3740,2605,"Overall this is a fun game, but there are two major problems:1. A lot of ""puzzles"" actually require you to utilize ""intentional glitches"" which circumvent the normal collision detection programming.  What do I mean by ""intentional glitches""?  Ever play Super Mario Maker?  Ever play a level where mario is in the MIDDLE of a bunch of bricks and you have to expertly move around INSIDE the collision area of the bricks to reach the flag, but if you accidentally touch the edge of a brick you get soft locked?YEAH - THAT KIND OF NONSENSE IS IN HERE!What makes it even more frustrating is if you don't think about abusing glitches.  I hate abusing glitches so I never liked doing those levels in SMM.  Well, THAT STUFF IS ALL OVER THIS GAME AT THE HIGHER LEVELS!  To top it off you have to INNATELY UNDERSTAND HOW TO GLITCH THE GAME because there are NO EXPLANATIONS on how to abuse these glitches.It's frustrating as hell.2. The game was NOT programmed with English in mind, it's a Scandanavian, so the syntax for making things work is freaking screwball if you aren't used to the syntax used in the Finish language.Otherwise it's hella fun and I do love it :)  Best sale game I've bought in a while."
3741,2605,fantastic puzzle game with simple mechanics but can become very challenging.

3745,2605,great unique game
3746,2605,"Puzzles are challenging yet satisfying to solve, often becoming really meta and requiring you to think of solutions in about 10 different ways. The art style and soundtrack fit the game perfectly and give it a feel like no other. Definitely recommended to any puzzle fan who likes a bit of a challenge in a cute package."
3747,2605,"I'm very bad at puzzle games, but this game is a delight!"
3748,2605,I am normally not a fan of puzzle games but this one makes you think so outside the box that it can't be ignored
3749,2605,"Very innovative, very creative, and particularly difficult. This is a puzzle game where thinking out of the box is a requirement, and for once I'm not breezing through puzzles in 5 minutes. It's great to have gameplay that ACTUALLY makes me think, and Baba is You accomplishes that."
3750,2605,"This is my game of the year for 2019. Very easy to learn, nearly impossible to master."
3751,2605,this is a fun puzzle game for the creative.
3752,2605,Made me feel like the smartest man alive and the dumbest man alive at the same time
3753,2605,"best puzzle game i have ever played, truly mind-bending"
3754,2605,"One of the best puzzle games I've ever played. If you like The Witness and/or Stephen's Sausage Roll you should definitely check out this game too. While it would appear that the game mechanics permit multiple solutions, only the first ~20 ""tutorial levels"" really allow for multiple solutions.  Be aware that after that point the difficulty starts ramping up, which might be a turn off if you weren't expecting it."
3755,2605,GAME IS GOOD
3756,2605,Baba is Good.
3757,2605,"Great game, really makes you think.I opened steam one day and saw the game and what sold me instantly was when the player became a wall!The first 30-70 levels aren't so bad, but after that they start to require some big brain thinking... I'll tell ya...Anyway, this game is really good for bonding with friends and family. I showed this game to several groups of friends and mostly watched them play without my help for 10-20 levels since I already completed them (I gave them small hints if they wanted them). I told them they should all try to solve the levels together and it worked out well. They all really liked the game and it was cool to see how they solved the puzzle cause sometimes it was different than how I solved it! I also got 3 of them to purchase the game lol. Fun game if you wanna test your divergent and convergent thinking! :D"
3758,2605,"very clever puzzler. lots of levels, many are very challenging (i couldn't do all of them). requires serious out of the box thinking, all the time. doesn't get stale either! lots of different mechanics are introduced throughout the game. really fun overall and rewarding when you do finally solve the levels. 10/10"

3760,2605,"Pretty neat puzzle game that lets you change the rules of the game by pushing words around. A simple concept, but man do these puzzles get hard. Feels great when you finally solve them."
3761,2605,"Great and challenging puzzles, specially towards the end of the game"
3762,2605,"An excellent mindbending puzzler. There is something immensely satisfying about the about the final ""AHA!"" moment when everything falls into place."
3763,2605,BABA is CONFUSING
3764,2605,yes
3765,2605,"10/10 absolutely bonkers puzzle game. If you like the concept of the video, you'll like the game. Everything you need is communicated through game & level design.The pacing is excellent. Each level will build a little on previous ones, but not so much that you have to keep track of a billion different things. It's worth noting that some new concepts have to just come out of the blue when they're introduced, so it's normal to feel totally lost until it clicks. If you get stuck, there's always a few other unlocked puzzles to choose from, so you can come back later (or probably even skip a few puzzles altogether if you need)."

It teaches you everything you need to know; your only obstacle is your ingenuity, and I think that is the mark of a truly good game. If you are at all intrigued by the premise as shown in the trailer, this is a must-buy."

3771,2605,"I am a person who hates Sokoban-type games as a rule, and this game is on my Top 5 now. The reason for that is (A.) the Undo button, and (B.) that it's the most creative and ""mentally fresh"" gaming experience I've had since PORTAL.I would have to nitpick pretty hard to say much against about the game. It'd be cool if there were more music tracks and textures in the game."

3777,2604,Fantastic Puzzles and engaging atmosphere!
3778,2604,"Such a simple and yet completely unique and innovative concept. At it's root, Baba Is You is a Sokoban-style block pushing puzzler. The blocks you are pushing are made of text or objects. By repositioning the pieces, you can rewrite the rules of the world. For example, Wall Is Stop can be broken to allow you to walk through walls. While it starts simple, the puzzles quickly become mind-breaking and the creativity the game allows for is incredibly deep. There's very little hand-holding and some of the puzzles are intentionally devious and misleading, so you have to be quick on the uptake and think outside the box. Definitely my favorite puzzle game this year. Every time I think I've reached the end, there are more layers. I'm 40 hours deep in this thing and the meta levels are making my brain hurt."

3790,2604,Wonderful puzzle game that is unlike any other puzzle game out there. Some levels are very frustrating though because the way the mechanics work is neither obvious nor intuitive.
3791,2604,Great little puzzle game.

3793,2604,.
3794,2604,Very clever game and really smart puzzles. Mightily impressed.
3795,2604,"Absolutely mind-blowing puzzle game! Makes me feel stupid for hours until I figure out the puzzle. Then I'm the smartest person in the world......until the next level. Seriously, just get it."
3796,2604,You know those games that start simple and then 5 levels later you're slamming your head against an in-game wall?  And then you wake up at 3am yelling because you've worked it out?  Baba Is You is one of those games.
3797,2604,"Baba Is You markets itself as a puzzle game that rewards outside-the-box creative thinking.  In my experience, it mainly rewards persistence.It's a pretty clever puzzle game, where the blocks physical positions also construct the logic of the game world.  That said, the puzzles get really hard fast, and there are no hints and the player is often left to learn new mechanics on their own through trial and error.  As such, this is not a goal-oriented game where the player gets to use their understanding and creativity to plan and execute a solution.  This is a puzzle game with one single solution that can only be found by randomly moving things about until it clicks into place; at which point you experience disappointment and relief, not the thrill of success.It is on the opposite end of the puzzle-game spectrum from Opus Magnum."
3798,2604,"One of the most fun and surprising puzzle games in years. A few simple overarching rules are taken to their extremes with every world giving you a new mechanic with bonus levels that stretch those mechanics to their satisfying limit. The graphics and music are minimal and wholly adequate for a game you'll spend dozens of hours looking at and hearing. It's easily one of the best games of the year, let alone puzzle games of the year."

3803,2604,Hard
3804,2604,"At time of writing: 31 hours, 4 worlds fully complete, plus some odds and ends. (Overall, a bit over 100 levels cleared.)This is a tricky, brain-bending game - basically a programming challenge in the medium of a top-down block puzzler. Its minimalism in presentation is charming, but it doesn't hold your hand - it really wants you to get crazy and out there with puzzle solutions. It takes almost no time at all to ramp up and start stumping, so if you get frustrated easily, this is a harder sell.Conveniently, everything is 'turn' based (nothing else moves unless you make a directional keypress or a 'pass') so that you can rewind the puzzle at any time, step-by-step, if you feel you've made a critical mistake. Either way, little replicates the feeling one gets when they bring You on top of the object to Win - this is a must-play for puzzle/programming fans."

3808,2604,Really cool and innovative type of puzzle game! The words change the environment.
3809,2604,"I found this game very original and enjoyable. Although it is single player, I've found it very enjoyable to introduce it to others, there's not much as exciting as seeing your friends experiment with it for a while before solving the puzzles.  Few games have so many satisfying AH-HA moments throughout!"
3810,2604,"Good puzzle game, gets very hard later on"
3811,2604,"This game is difficult and tricky, and made me struggle at times, but the happiness after completing a level is totally worth it."

3813,2604,An incredibly simple idea that can produce some extremely complex and difficult puzzles.

3816,2604,"Baba is you is probably one of the best puzzle games of all time. Every single level of this game will teach you something new about what this game can do. You'd be amazed by just how many times this game will surprise you, even after you complete the third overworld and make your way to the fourth."

3819,2604,Brain Is You
3820,2604,Baba Is You And Smart
3821,2604,"Baba is You is an innovative and very challenging puzzle game. The main concept is simple: Push text around to create statements like ""Rock is push"" or ""Flag is Win"". Each of these Statements immediately change the rules of the game.But it`s not as simple as it sounds, because you can have thousands of word combinations and most levels only have one solution. This is due to the fact that some words are unreachable and the design of the levels is great, because there is never a simple solution and you sometimes have to learn entirely new mechanics to beat a level. The biggest challenge is, changing your way of thinking. For example: You don`t always sink in water and keys are not always used to open doors. You can use keys to open rocks, or have water floating, you can have boxes that contain more boxes, you can transform all stars into flags, you can have grass moving by itself, or you can even control a wall. The possibilities in this game are endless and there is so much thought put into the mechanics of this game. I`m not really good at puzzle games, but I still had a lot of fun with this game. Sometimes it takes a very long time to beat a level, but if you have finally done it, you feel amazing, trust me. The game is not very expensive and a gem of 2019, so I would recommend buying this game, as long as you don`t totally hate puzzle games."
3822,2604,I haven't played this game in a bit and my brain still hurts
3823,2604,"This game looks amazing, is fun (to an extent) and has a great soundtrack, however I found a massive problem with this game was how unintuitive it felt to play. I have been having the same problem as many other people who have left negative reviews of this game. I know I am not the smartest but I often enjoy a puzzle for it's challenge and learning how each mechanic works ON MY OWN. The game begins well and it feels great to figure out how to complete the puzzle...however there comes a point where the logic you have gathered in the first few levels is not nearly enough to progress through the later puzzles. I ended up going to walkthroughs for nearly all of the puzzles after a certain point which was frustrating and spoiled the fun. On top of that the levels that I got stuck on often had mechanics that I was never introduced to in the first place and so going to a walkthrough for a solution only made me annoyed as it was somehow something I was meant to figure out. I wish that there was less of a difficulty spike and a more intuitive way to learn the mechanics because then I could have actually had fun with this game.I played this for a bit more than 3 hours so can't get a refund anymore (I think) but if I could get a refund I definitely would. It's not worth the money given that the only way I can get through this game is if the walkthrough essentially plays it for me."
3824,2604,Outstandingly innovative puzzle solving that introduces new mechanics to keep things interesting while maintaining its difficulty and entertainment value. Great game.
3825,2604,Really fun and really hard!
3826,2604,"Very creative puzzles, distinctive artstyle and nice music all make this one of the best puzzle games I have recently played."
3827,2604,"An innovative, lateral thinking puzzle game that will engage your mental aptitudes and keep you occupied for hours. Dont be intimidated by the ever-growing difficulty, as you have as much time as you like to solve each stage, and its easy enough to restart a given level from the beginning, or even just take a single step back if you make a wrong move. If you derive a sense of satisfaction from overcoming challenging problems, then this game will leave you feeling quite content indeed! Though the graphics are relatively basic, I would say that this only helps to prevent unnecessary distraction. Give it a try!"

3840,2604,"Amazing puzzle game, great for quick and short sessions for a break from work"
3841,2604,"Baba is You is a wonderful little puzzle game.  It is a game that can get a lot of mileage out of a very simple premise.  While the game starts off fairly easy, before long the puzzles become absolute mind melters.  Some of the solutions in this game are bonkers crazy but I like that about the game.  It is always going to keep you on your toes.  I definitely recommend checking it out"

3868,2604,"Baba is You is simply the best puzzle game I've ever played. A simple, yet extremely open-ended main concept, this game is characterized by rules being as flexible as the world they occupy. Hempuli has created a master-class example of what it means to be a brilliant mechanics designer, taking the idea of text defining rules, and running with it until it hits a logical extreme. This is one of the few games where, despite a complete lack of story, spoilers should be avoided, as the amount of secrets contained in Baba is You are innumerable, incredible, and satisfying to discover.Mentioning this game during a job interview also literally got me an Internship at a AAA company as a mechanics designer, so that's extra points aplenty."

3874,2604,Outstanding puzzle game.
3875,2604,Incredibly meta and mindwarping game. Got me thinking gor hours on end!
3876,2604,"Baba Is You is one of those puzzle games that manages to be both incredibly simple (use the arrow keys to move and push/pull stuff around) and incredibly complex (you can implement a turing complete computer in it). The game does a good job of introducing new mechanics as they become available, then combines them in increasing creative ways to make a truly challenging puzzler that requires you to constantly change your thought process. The game is completely fair;while you can change the specific rules, each mechanic always works the same. Ultimately, Baba Is You is for anyone who wants a challenging puzzler that will make you feel like a genius with (almost) every ""Congratulations!"" you get."
3877,2604,This is a great puzzle game where you move blocks around a screen to program the world around you. Cute visuals. All around great game.

3882,2604,"Reminds me of trying to solve coding puzzles, they basically are that. Some are incredibly difficult and others are easy to solve from looking from afar."
3883,2604,"Baba Is You is a game with mechanics that are easy to understand and yet can make some of the most complicated puzzles in all of gaming. The style is simple, almost childish, and yet adds to the aesthetic of the game in such a way that any other style simply would not have fit. The way puzzles can be solved is hardly ever linear, allowing for creative ways to progress through the levels and to get to the end of the game. While I have yet to solve every puzzle, I cannot wait to do so.9/10"
3884,2604,"I have never played a game that strips down how puzzle games work. It's rare to see games that take one single idea and the exploit the hell out of them to the point where they are no longer the same type of puzzle. Witness and Antichamber come to mind with games similar to this. Wow, it deserves all the hype it gets."
3885,2604,"Very difficult, yet never unfair puzzle game.  Gives a new innovative twist to some traditional puzzle game play."
3886,2604,Absolutely love puzzle games and this was a creative new kind of game. Controlling the rules of the world via sentences is super fun and genuinely tricky sometimes. If you like puzzle games then definitely give this one a shot!

3896,2604,"Baba is you is a game that's simple to learn, but difficult to master. It's a block pushing puzzle game mixed with a healthy serving of programming logic shenanigans. Some levels require you to truly think out of the box to solve, and it's absolutely worth however much you need to pay to get it. =D"
3897,2604,"Absolutely amazing! Each and every new world comes with new behaviors which surprise you more than the last. Many of the levels will result in hours and hours of head scratching, but nothing feels as good as finally figuring out the solution after tinkering for so long. The game mechanics are already clever by themselves, but even more when combined with one another, which most of the time results in really interesting, unexpected, surprising - and sometimes bizarre - interactions. The only problem in this game seems to be with the difficulty curve - without any sort of hint system, you're sometimes clueless as to how to apply the mechanics you've learned in order to solve the problem presented by the level. Although, this won't be a problem if you like challenges - what I've noticed is just that, later in the game, it could get a bit overwhelming to be stuck in dozens of levels at once. This, however, is compensated by the vast amount of guides and discussion threads on Steam, which are available in many levels of ""help"" - whether you want to get the solution right away, or just a subtle hint to help you figure out the answer by yourself.In general, it's a really good game that managed to achieve one of the hardest things to accomplish: to combine a great concept with a great execution. If you're the type of player that likes puzzle games, this one should definitely be in your list!"
3898,2604,very creative and fun game
3899,2604,Cute visual style for a puzzle game. Incredibly creative in it's puzzle design and forces you to think. Very nice level progression. High recommend.
3900,2604,"The game uses slide puzzles as a disorienting canvas for some really difficult sequential logic problems. I'm not certain if I'd directly recommend Baba is You, but I'll certainly commend it for its creativity and for how efficiently it scrambled my brain. The sharp build-up in those first few segments of stages told my lack of patience that I wouldn't stand a chance against the rest of the game. I'd suggest grabbing the game for a lighter price on a portable platform like the Switch. Playing at home on a desktop for longer sessions makes it difficult to focus and there are always walkthroughs too temptingly nearby."
3901,2604,10/10 Finally a puzzle game that puzzles me.
3902,2604,Good game but I'm terrible at it.
3903,2604,Me Is Fan of puzzle gamesBaba Is You Is Unlike any other puzzle game I've played         Is   Amazing
3904,2604,"A cunning puzzle game that redefines the rules. One puzzle might be solved by turning the walls into your character, another by making them float. The only limit is what's on the screen. It's the most interesting puzzle game I've ever seen."
3905,2604,uwu
3906,2604,"Big brain puzzle game, if you remotely enjoy puzzles or sadistically laugh at your dumb friends for being dumb its a must buy"

3917,2604,"Amazing puzzle game with a simple style and a fantastic core gameplay mechanic. It can be frustratingly difficult at times but if anything that makes the puzzles more rewarding to solve. Plus, there are multiple pathways to take, so you can always try a different level to spice things up"
3918,2604,Very unique and mind boggling. Well worth a play.
3919,2604,this puzzle game is really one of its kind with a charming atmosphere.you really need to think outside the box for some of the later puzzles.just brilliant from start till end.

3922,2604,"A wonderfully mind-bending puzzle game that has enough simplicity to be easily accessible.  Great difficulty curve, many possible solutions to the puzzles.  Much Recommend!"
3923,2604,"It will make you feel extremely stupid, incomprehensible smart, and back to hopelessly dumb in a matter of seconds.The puzzles are smartly designed and beautifully presented in a very simple and charming way.When is Outstanding, puzzles gives you multiple solutions, even some that feel like cheating, but are valid.When is Bad, puzzles are designed to be solved in one specific order in a long string of inputs, which can be frustrating and unsatisfactory.Baba Is You is hard to describe. But rest assured that there hasn't been anything like this before."
3924,2604,video game
3925,2604,"Alright so the game is really well made and mostly unique i will recommend it to anyone who loves hard puzzles even tho i refunded it because im bad at it, but if u love puzzles try it out!Sorry if there are gramatic mistakes"

Cons: A bit difficult at times."

3944,2604,baba is baby
3945,2604,gud gaem
3946,2604,A very unique puzzle game that requires a ridiculous amount of lateral thinking and makes your brain hurt. The sheer amount of puzzles made from the many different mechanics ensures you'll be coming back to level after level when you wake up in a cold sweat after the solution clicks.
3947,2604,"Baba is you is a cute little puzzle game, where you not only have to navigate each level and solve physical challenges, but also have to manipulate sentences within the level to change how the game works. It's an amazing puzzle game, and I would recommend it to everyone!"
3948,2604,Nice
3949,2604,"I'm terrible at solving the puzzles and I've hardly scratched the surface. However, whenever I go back to it, I am pleasantly surprised by finding ""Wow that puzzle was actually really easy!"" or ""Wow I'm surprised that worked!"" It's a fantastic game for people who enjoy out-of-box thinking and puzzle games, but be warned; it is difficult."
3950,2604,[Baba]  is [Good][Good] is [Good][Text]   is  [Stop]
3951,2604,"A hard and innovative puzzle game which I will never complete, but was still worth the price."
3952,2604,Sokoban meets programming to make lateral thinking puzzles
3953,2604,"Reminds me of Snakebird... except it's a lot more forgiving early on.Snakebird was kind enough to give you an undo button, but by about Level 5 it let go of your hand and let you flounder without teaching you enough of the principle 'tricks' to get you through the first few worlds of the game.Baba Is You looks difficult early on. But once the game leads you into realising a few of its tricks (namely, that you can link multiple '[Noun] is [Adjective]' statements via the starting noun or finishing adjective, and also that you can use '[Noun] is [Noun]' statements too) the game opens up in a way Snakebird never could.I fully expect this game to get VERY hard very quickly, many reviews call this game damn hard. But at least it holds your hand for a little longer than the first 10 minutes."
3954,2604,"This game will probably be one of those that are mentioned whenever you talk about groundbreaking new gameplay mechanics and ideas of how to break the normal ideas of how to structure a game.The game is fun and challenging to boot, after feeling like you're einstein beating one level you're smashed back to reality by the next level."
3955,2604,A fantastic puzzle game that build very complicated puzzles from easy-to-understand peices!Also kudos for proper pacing with regularily increasing difficulty.
3956,2604,baba is hard

3958,2604,"It's just one of those games that will make you feel like an absolute moron on some levels, only to make you feel like the smartest man alive when you solve the puzzle. Heartily recommended."
3959,2604,My brain cells died with a smile.
3960,2604,It's almost ugly but only almost. You can play only for few minutes or longer period if you like to hit your head to wall. It's so hard and so damn cool idea. Totally recommend!
3961,2604,yes

3965,2604,Good game
3966,2604,"I never thought I'd compare a puzzle game to Super Meat Boy, yet here we are."
3967,2604,"A unique puzzle game that could be best described as something between Sokoban and programming. The premise is simple, but Baba Is You does a good job to create challenging puzzles with the few simple rules it employs. You can just skip around the puzzles and take your time, there is no timer, it's turn-based and there are quick reset and step-back features. It looks charming, however you may turn off the wobbling animations during longer play times. One thing it lacks for perfection is a Steam Workshop or any map editor."
3968,2604,"Great game that blends what seem to be easy puzzle elements into something that will make you wonder both how you can be so clever and so stupid, both at the same time usually."
3969,2604,"A terrific puzzle game, at which I am awful."
3970,2604,"Rules:Baba is You, Gameplay is simple,Puzzle is challenging,Baba is Adorable,Game is Fun!"
3971,2604,world gone
3972,2604,"This game is innovative, creative, and primed to give you those ""ah-ha!"" moments if you stick to the puzzles long enough. You will need to stick to it though, as these puzzles get TOUGH. Fun enough to be worth all the hair-pulling, though."
3973,2604,Looks simple.  Deceptively difficult.
3974,2604,baba is you and good
3975,2604,Uno de los mejores juegos de puzzles

3977,2604,"Spent half an hour coming up with a solution for certain level, used every component available to me, asked my brother after how he solved it and he showed me it could've been done in few moves in much less complicated way. Love how this game doesn't force you to ""discover"" one pre-set way of solving certain puzzles, but instead lets you to find your own solution."
3978,2604,Clever puzzle game
3979,2604,Undoubtedly the most genuinely fun puzzle game I've ever played.
3980,2604,its fun

3983,2604,"You will feel dumb, and thats okay."

3985,2604,"I must say this game is one of the most amazing pure puzzle games I have ever played.I just love the idea, I also love the execution of the idea, and I absolutely love the level design.I like how all the levels have some doodads to emphasize the theme of the level, and then the same doodads are used in another level as something you can interact with.Also, I love how clever some puzzles are. Not ""hard"", but ""clever"". Like that one where you have to ""play dead"" while passing through tiles that kill you, and then magically become alive again!This is now one of my favorite games, right next to Braid and SpaceChem."

3998,2604,"Amazing game, one of the most brilliant and clever indie/puzzle video games of the last 10 years. Haven't finished it and probably never will, VERY hard game. Simple and amazing concept, cute and adorable graphics and music. If you love puzzles and do not fear indie games, you must try this game, it is one of the most genius pieces of art ever.Watch me LIVEJoin me on DiscordSee my Reviews!My old detailed review is down there:  RANK COMMENT  TOTAL:86% a GREAT puzzle game!What an amazing game. Probably the most brilliant and clever indie/puzzle video game of the last 10 years. I still haven't finished it and probably never will, because A) the game is VERY hard, B) I lack time, C) I refuse to look at the solution.The concept is simply amazing, the graphics and music are cute and adorable. If you love puzzles and do not fear indie games, you must try this game, it is one of the most genius pieces of art ever. After playing it, you feel like speaking like this: ""KEKE is YOU, and BABA is LOVE"".       GAMEPLAY:9/10 This is everything, in that game. A genius idea. Portal was brilliant, Baba is You is even more. The reason why it is a 9 and not a 10: the difficulty... I will not complain that it is too hard, but it is too hard for me to probably ever finish it. Very hard puzzler, be warned!   CONTENT:7/10 Interesting and cute, a charming setting without much to think of.   VIDEO:7/10 Pixel and indie, for a very cute art.   AUDIO:7/10 Same here, sounds and music are adorable.   OTHER:7/10 A lot of content, you should not be bored. I wonder if custom levels exist? if so, it might become a 8 or even a 9.       DISCLAIMER I have NOT finished that game (too hard, not enough time). Also, if you do not like logical puzzles reminiscent of coding/programming you may want to skip that game (or try it to change your opinion!)"

4005,2604,"This might just be the best puzzle game of all time.If you like sokoban-likes and insanely hard puzzles, get this now."
4006,2604,"Cute looking game with a simple concept. The game starts off easy, lulling the player into a false sense of security ""oh I know how to poozle"" but the game will soon ramp up the difficulty making you feel so very stupid.Highly recommended for anyone who likes puzzle-games."
4007,2604,My brain is melting
4008,2604,You really have to put your thinking cap to figure out how to resolve some of the puzzles. Amazing! :)
4009,2604,So fun but brain hurt
4010,2604,"Baba is You is the best puzzle game I ever played right after The Witness. It is incredibly clever, and it keeps on giving many hours after you start thinking ""Ok, I got it"". The game never stops introducing new mechanics to challenge your mind and it just never gets old or boring.BABA IS GOTY"
4011,2604,BABA IS YOUISGOOD
4012,2604,"This game is actually surprisingly good and it ramps up in difficulty.If you like puzzle games, especially those that take a simple concept and make it really complex, this is definitely a game for you."

4016,2604,ME    BABA   IS FUN      NOT     SMART
4017,2604,This is an incredible game. Rarely are puzzle games this challenging for me.
4018,2604,to top que eu fico preso mas no consigo desistir
4019,2604,"Baba is you, is a great puzzle game that challenges you to think outside the box."
4020,2604,"When I first played this game, the mechanics blew my mind. Later in the game, you'll need to make sure that you have a solid understanding of each mechanic because the levels get very difficult. But the feeling of solving a level that you've been stuck on for a bit just feels amazing. Seriously, the level design and the solutions to the levels are just insanely good."
4021,2604,When I was buying the game I was afraid of the level design. But I must admit that the level design is great (at least for me). Mostly the solution is short (just a few moves) but difficult to find out. And that means that you can solve the levels quite very quickly and the only thing that slows you down is your brain (and not the amount of moves).
4022,2604,"A clever puzzle game with simple rules. Despite the fact that the moves don't seem to change, each puzzle seems to add a new layer and require a new way of thinking. Often a solution requires taking a step back and coming to it fresh from a whole new direction."
4023,2604,"Here's a game that will frustrate you and then make you feel clever. The basic mechanic gets exploited for all its worth in brilliant, unexpected and often chaotic ways. Puzzles get pretty difficult pretty fast, but be patient and try your best. You won't be disappointed."
4024,2604,"It can be quite hard, even from the start. Still, the concept is very good and the game is enjoyable."
4025,2604,"Probably the most innovative game to in sequence make me feel dumb and then smart, and repeats until I just feel dumb at a puzzle I can't make sense of."
4026,2604,This game bends my mind in strange new ways. I feel that I'm a better person for playing it.
4027,2604,Literal word play
4028,2604,"Before playing:I'm good at puzzle games, bring it on!After playing:ME IS STUPID AND BRAIN IS BROKEN"
4029,2604,"Baba Is You is an amazing puzzle game. At first it seems simple but a few levels in, the walls don't stop you, you are the wall, the wall isn't even a wall anymore. Baba can be quite challenging on the brain, with all the possible combinations of rules and interactions that derive from those rules, but I'd give it a try if I were you. There are many guides both online and on steam that offer hints to the levels but don't spoil them entirely. Spoilers: When you reach Overworld Level-9 you unlock the noun LEVEL, which adds to the complexity of the game, where the map itself is a level. I found this part of the game mind-blowing. The fact that the island I was playing on this whole time was a level?! It's incredible. Also, there is a level editor, where you can play fan-made levels (most of them being harder than the main game) and develop your own. The level editor even includes words that aren't used in the base game. Baba gets a 10/10 from me, great puzzles, cute sprites, amazing fanbase. Highly recommend."
4030,2604,"I wish I could describe this game with another game, but I can't. It faintly reminds me of a card game where the winning condition is random, same as the rules and both change as you play."
4031,2604,Very fun and difficult. Fun with friends. :thumbsup:
4032,2604,Mind-bendingly awesome
4033,2604,"Hard, need brain so I can't beat."
4034,2604,This game is super cool! It's a must have if you like puzzle games where you need to think outside the box.. like literally. you change the rules of the level to solve puzzles here.
4035,2604,Really fun game and great concept. Very confusing at times
4036,2604,"It is a unique puzzle game that forces you to think outside the box. If you're looking for new gameplay in the puzzle genre, this is it!"
4037,2604,Literally requires 500 IQ. One of the best puzzle games I've ever played.
4038,2604,Good puzzle game
4039,2604,Warning! Outside the box thinking is required. 10/10
4040,2604,"This is my game of the year. I have shown this game to literally 10 of my friends. Every single one of them is hooked after just 3 levels.I can't think of a game design as creative as this game in quite some time. Yes I am impressed hempuli created the game. But it goes to a eniterly different level when I thin about him coming up with these puzzles, especially the late game ones! It is just crazy to me.This developer deserves recognition for such an ingenious idea. Highly recommend"

Now it's just the question of it getting repetitive after a while, but based on my impression of the first few levels, the answer is likely no.If you're just looking for a fun and creative puzzle game to chill with, i'd definitely recommend picking this one up."

4079,2604,"""There is no way in hell that was the intended solution.""checks wiki""I'm a  moron."""
4080,2604,"What a brilliant game! I've played Baba Is You on Nintendo Switch for 55 hours and cleared a bit over 150 levels. Now got the game on PC too (mainly to get the soundtrack). But once I started playing the game again on PC I lost track of time listening to the hypnotic tunes and watching Baba wiggle around... The inventive gameplay mechanics and cleverly designed levels offer demonic brain twisting challenge. I don't remember many games giving such immense satisfaction when you finally find a solution to a puzzle which at first seemed impossible to clear. And like others pointed out, sometimes the game makes me feel so stupid for being stuck in a level for a long time and in the end the solution was actually really simple and obvious..."

4123,2604,"Follow our Curator Group for more reviewsBaba Is You is a 2D puzzle game focusing around word/phrase puzzles specifically. There are sometimes other elements to each puzzle, but the core of the game is about combining words into phrases in order to change the rules of that puzzle. For example, you might have the words Baba, Flag, Win, Is, Wall, Stop, and You. Usually, Flag is Win starts out as a default rule that cant be changed, but sometimes it isnt. You could solve the puzzle by saying Wall is Win, then bumping into the wall to complete the level. You could also remove the word Stop from Wall is Stop, which would allow you to walk through the wall and touch the flag to win. There is a huge amount of possibilities thanks to this open-ended system, which does wonders to keep the game interesting and varied.The game starts off slow, but quickly ramps up the difficulty and complexity. Some puzzles have challenge versions, in which the obvious solution is no longer possible and you need to think of a new strategy. This is done by making slight changes to an existing puzzle that seem relatively minor, but wind up forcing you to think outside the box. It shows off how talented the developers are, to be able to create the same puzzle twice but with wildly different solutions.Aside from puzzles, there really isnt anything else in this game. There isnt a narrative like Portal, instead the game focuses all of its energy on puzzle design. For some people, this can make the game a little one-dimensional, but for hardcore puzzle fans, it gives you a huge challenge and doesnt hold your hand as you play.Baba Is You is one of the most well crafted puzzle games of all time, easily earning its stellar review score and all the praise it has received.10/10Visit our website for more in-depth reviews and recommendations"

4129,2604,Nominated for The Most Innovative Gameplay Award
4130,2604,A unique puzzle game where you change the conditions of winning the level by moving words around with Baba. Its very charming and fun. There are different ways to solve each level and worth a buy in my books.
4131,2604,"Great mind-bending puzzler.  You'll be incredibly frustrated until you figure out the correct solution.  Then, you'll smack yourself in the forehead for missing the obvious."

4133,2604,"One might expect a puzzle game where the player has control over the rules to be extremely easy.  Indeed, as a computer science major myself, I consider myself to have critical thinking and algorithmic problem-solving skills well above the average.  And yet, Baba is You is a game that regularly makes me feel like an idiot.The game starts simple, of course, but it rapidly becomes more and more complex.  As the player progresses, the new rules they can create become more and more high-level and abstract, to such a point where even experimenting with different combinations of rules while circumnavigating the constraints of the level is a daunting challenge.And yet, it never becomes frustrating.  Between its subdued, bassy soundtrack and its wibbly-lined, childlike art style, Baba manages to maintain a very lax atmosphere (Not to mention offset the existential horror of turning sapient beings into rocks and keys, or accidentally forming the extremely nihilistic rule, ""ALL IS EMPTY"").  All-in-all, it's a very pure puzzle game, and one I would describe as surprisingly cozy.  On a rainy day where you don't really feel like going out, it might be wise to boot up Baba and spend a little bit of time thinking about those levels you've been stuck on for a whilethe solution may come to you when you least expect it.Nine Babas out of Ten"

4167,2604,"""Baba is You"" is probably the most mind breaking, yet satisfying game I played in a while.

You can for the most part think your way to the solution by looking at each puzzle, there is a few exceptions to this that I can think of, which is very good. It is still not easy, you'll need to experiment your way around to figure out how things work. But there is a rather simple logic to it that becomes a surprisingly clever puzzle that makes sense and for the most part are not so hacky.Warning: You will overdose on this if you can't limit the daily intake. You will go insane. I'm not saying that because I'm insane because I did just that. I'm uh not speaking from experience. So I don't know really. Ok forget I said anything."

4257,2604,"I'm old enough to write that first PC game I played was Doom. Original 1993 Doom. I've played numerous games since then, of course, yet the first game that made me think about gameplay itself, about rules behing sprites, pixels, screens was  Baba is you. The game is deceptively cute, with fairy tale vibe, cute sound effects and colours. Don't be fooled by this, Baba is HARD. I work as a software developer, often working with legacy code that is pure chaos and still - Baba is you makes me feel dumb.It is brilliant. Buy this game, play it, support truly innovative and independent gamemakers.Buy it because BABA is YOU."

4268,2604,Great
4269,2604,"Baba Is You is one of those weird game concepts that comes out of nowhere despite seeming obvious in retrospect, and while some of the puzzles can be INCREDIBLY obtuse thanks to the nature of the game, it's a concept that's incredibly well executed.The core gameplay is to put an object that IS YOU (e.g. controlled by the player character) onto the same tile as an object that IS WIN. You can only move up/down/left/right or wait for a turn, allowing any object that IS MOVE to take a single step forward; There is no ""interact"" button. A set of Words on every stage can be pushed (like boxes in traditional block-pushing games) to create Rules which then apply universally to everything in the level. No objects have any inherent meaning; A wall will only become solid if ""WALL IS STOP"" is written, either horizontally or vertically, somewhere in the level.There are ten worlds in the game, most of which introduce one new concept and use it throughout (later worlds occasionally have multiple concepts, which are explored in isolated subsections). The game does a very good job at the setpiece/antepiece relationship; The early levels in any given world will usually be straightforward puzzles, steadily growing more complex, allowing you to ease into a concept without needing it to be explicitly described to you.Predictably, some of the later worlds can be ruthlessly difficult as concepts are blended together and reused in clever ways. Almost no two puzzles are alike; It feels like every level has a distinct solution from the rest, to the game's benefit. However, I'd advise not looking up details about the game before playing; There may be a few surprising secrets that you want to wait and see aboutHighly recommended. The game looks simple for $15, but there's far more than enough content for it to be worth it if you like unusual puzzlers."
4270,2604,BABA IS YOUISGAME IS GOOD
4271,2604,GAME IS GOOD
4272,2604,"What I liked:   A true brain teaser from start to finish  The most simple and yet hardest puzzles ever created Unique puzzle mechanicsWhat I didnt like:   Some rules arent ever explained and meant to be figured out by trial and errorMy Score: A++Quick Summary Overall this game is another instant puzzle classic that given its simple looking nature is so much harder than I bet most will expect and will be loved by any puzzle fan without a doubt. Dont let it being a text based puzzle game scare you away from this gem.More in depth:  I love a good puzzle game, with years between getting anything good. This one was worth the long gap.  The game starts out with simple move text around to solve word problems tied to gameplay mechanics. Its way funnier than it sounds, and it never gets boring 20 hours in. Let that sink in, you get 20 hours of brain teasing puzzles. Most puzzle games either run out of ideas/content half way to that point. If that doesnt get you hard, you must not like puzzle games.   You get rules that you cant manipulate, like touching a skull will kill you, with a skull directly blocking your only way forward, with other rules to let you know what you cant do. Because if it doesnt say you cant do it, you can do it. Like a simple making you two different objects and using one to suicide to make a path for you in one of them. Figuring out the solution is half the battle, as actually doing it is also hard.My only issue was that I need to look up a handful of solutions because they do very little to teach you, you learn through doing. A spoiler and an example is I didnt know you can overlap words to have both be applied. But once you learn the few ideas, you wont need to look up any help, unless you cant solve one and spend way too long and then find out it was really simple and you feel stupid.

4279,2604,It's good.
4280,2604,This game really makes you FEEL like Baba.
4281,2604,This game is almost too clever for its own good. Just when you think you've got your head around the mechanics and think you'll be able to cruise through the rest of the game with ease it hits you with another logical logic defying option. Truly difficult but truly great this game will change the way you think about language and 2D space.
4282,2604,Review is positive
4283,2604,ME is WRITING REVIEW is VERY ORIGINAL
4284,2604,GAME IS NEAT
4285,2604,"This is good game, will absolutely ruin your ability to process language.  Some good think-brain moments."
4286,2604,BABA IS GOOD
4287,2604,"an innovative puzzle game for sure, great music, great style, great puzzles; what else do you need?"
4288,2604,"pretty confusing, but great puzzles"
4289,2604,Game is fire.
4290,2604,My favourite game that I'm too dumb to play. But I love it so much <3
4291,2604,"An ingenious way to incorporate logic in to game play. I was very pleased with the ramp up in pacing and the overall difficulty of the game, which kept me engaged."
4292,2604,Most innovative game i have seen
4293,2604,baba is excellent
4294,2604,"watched Faker play and now I am a Iron 4, would recommend again."
4295,2604,good 100%
4296,2604,Game is good but hard.The dark souls of video games
4297,2604,Puzzle is HardBaba is Cute
4298,2604,"Baba is You presents a new form of puzzles that immediately begin to challenge the player. It's number one rule is to literally think outside the box. Normal solutions don't work in Baba; instead, the player has to stop trying to win based on the parameters, and change them. This game is about modifying rules, mechanics, and level design so that they allow you to win, an element which is challenging yet enjoyable for anyone who enjoys using unconventional methods of problem solving."
4299,2604,"Weird, fun game."
4300,2604,Brain melt
4301,2604,"A lovely puzzle game that will make you think outside the box. Some puzzles even have multiple solutions, intentional or not (I dont know)"
4302,2604,"probably the best, most solid puzzle game I've played"
4303,2604,"This was an amazing game! I loved every second of it! Personally, my favourite level was Chasm Extra 7. I don't want to give away anything, but this was a really good level to figure out and a great way, for me, to end off the 8th world. This is probably my favourite game and I can't wait for the level editor to come out.5/5 stars"
4304,2604,Will blow your mind every level. Most innovative game of the year imo.
4305,2604,Baba is good. Game is hard and win. Brain is hurt.
4306,2604,Excellent outside-the-box thinking puzzle game
4307,2604,Game is amazing. Baba is you.
4308,2604,"Truly amazing. It can be quite difficult, but the pacing is great, and it never gets TOO hard.Definitely recommend."
4309,2604,game is funpet baba a tonor you better runcause baba has gun
4310,2604,"A somewhat mind bending puzzle game, that actually gets complicated. Just a good and very creative game."
4311,2604,"Highly polished, with a unique twist on the usual puzzle formula with letting you change the logic of how the in-game rules work. Once you get into the game the puzzles get more and more difficult, but the solutions to them always seem obvious when I manage to get to them. The game is fairly forgiving, however, only requiring you to finish a certain number of puzzles in an area to complete it, and letting you rewind and restart quickly and painlessly.Wonderful puzzle game, something I would recommend to almost everyone interested in the genre."
4312,2604,Great innovative game.  Harder than it looks!
4313,2604,A truly mind-bending game with innovative mechanics. A little like a cross between sokoban and a dictionary.
4314,2604,This game is hard.
4315,2604,"A unique, fun, and difficult puzzle game."
4316,2604,"this game has a great way of making me feel dumb, then 30 minutes later my brain just clicks and the solution comes to me. one of the best puzzle games i've ever played."
4317,2604,10/10
4318,2604,"This is a game that will both drive you insane but, after figuring out a solution, make you feel like you can't be stopped. don't expect to complete this game quickly, so of the challenges will require you going away and clearing your head. but well worth a buy"
4319,2604,Very Fun game. Now if only i could not be bad at videos game i might beat it this year.
4320,2604,It's a pretty fun game and it really makes you think if you are into puzzles and figuring stuff out!
4321,2604,My brain hurts.
4322,2604,"Are you really baba or is baba you?some puzzles left me scratching my head for a while, after looking at it from new angles I realized that the puzzles are simple and that I was in fact a monkey while trying to solve it. You do not play the game; the game plays you. You are god, incarnate as a sheep-looking thing: bending the rules of the world you are put in to result in ""winning"" but are you really winning?"
4323,2604,this game is amazing and every time i beat a level the epiphany moment is incredible that in addition to the large amount of content and manny interesting worlds.
4324,2604,"It's a great game that has many possibilities that force you to think outside the box.Frustrating at times, but very enjoyable."
4325,2604,"Creative, challenging and fun"
4326,2604,"Fun and challenging! Really ramps into difficulty well, providing ""a ha!"" moments along the way."
4327,2604,great design game play
4328,2604,"Very neat concept for a puzzle game, kind of reminds me of programming a bit."

4334,2604,Amazing. Brilliant. show-stopping. hard as balls.
4335,2604,"Baba is You is a charming and cute little ""coding"" game where you have to solve levels using text in them to change the rules. For example, if ""Wall Is Stop"" you can't walk through the wall, but if you break the statement, you can.The game is all about thinking outside the box and trying out new (and sometimes very odd) solutions to problems.Oh, and the graphics are just so cute!Definetly reccomend it if you love puzzle games!"

4338,2604,"I highly recommend this game. I'm not normally that big on puzzle games, but this is awesome. It's really innovative! Basically you get a series of word tiles you can push around inside the game world and create sentences. You can change the word physics, you can change yourself, you can negate yourself from even existing or you can turn everything on the map into you. It's really fun, and hard to boot."
4339,2604,I'm too dumb for this
4340,2604,"A really good puzzle game, both challenging and rewarding that will make you use your  Big Brain (and making you feel stupid from time to time when you realise how logic and easy a level was) . If you like challenge give it a try it's worth it!"

4345,2604,Bamboozling
4346,2604,"Baba is cruelKazza is stupidFor real, Baba is You is a top-down block-pushing puzzle game in which you can change certain rules.  After the first couple of levels, the difficulty ramps up up UP, and you are forced to devise insane solutions that run counter to how a game is supposed to work.  It's brilliant; I find myself thinking about specific levels while I'm driving, or in the shower, or at work.  Occasionally I even figure out how to get past a level.The soundtrack is also quite good."

4391,2604,Game is Good
4392,2604,A fun puzzle game that rewards thinking inside and outside the box. Never felt more successful than solving these puzzles with no outside assistance.
4393,2604,"I never imagined that the concept of building a set of simple rules could be expanded into such a detailed, challenging game! Late game levels become quite the brain teaser, so be prepared to actually use your brain a bit!"
4394,2604,"Game is good.Very logic-based puzzle game, challenging yet not frustrating. Excellent soundtrack and atmosphere."
4395,2604,A brilliant masterpiece that puts your wits to the test. The developer has done an excellent job through creative and challenging puzzle design. Absolutely recommended!

4401,2604,Baba is by far my favorite game of the year. Wonderfully challenging puzzles that bring you to entirely deconstruct a blurred line between code and gameplay. There comes a point where you are redefining enough of the ingame variables that it feels as if you are looking for edgecases and quirks of the system to exploit as proper solutions! Wonderful and fun!
4402,2604,Baba Is You
4403,2604,"A great puzzle game in which will always keep you thinking, even when you think you know whats going on you soon lean something new about what to do."

4405,2604,"It is such a pleasure to find such a simple concept game with no story that is so amusing based only in the possibilities given for puzzle solving. I love playing puzzle games and this one is definitely one of, if not, my favourite games. I truly recommend this for all puzzle lovers, puzzles are tricky and you really need to think out of the box.BABA is WIN.BABA is END."

Yes, the graphics are simple but very much fit the style and purpose. It terms of puzzling gameplay and difficulty, it's actually a really clever and complex game. Very cool new mechanic where you change the rules of the level and items, which sometimes can really mess with your head. Highly recommended if you are looking for a proper brain-teaser."
4424,2604,Makes you feel like a brainlet. Also made by Finns

4442,2604,One of the best puzzlers out now. It takes the great idea of playing with game rules and runs with it. The later levels are genuinely impressive with how far they push the concepts (although they can be a rather restrictive).10/10. Can't wait for ESA2.

4446,2604,Baba is fun
4447,2604,Incredibly fun and innovative puzzle game
4448,2604,"If Sokoban had a child with any programming game, you'd always get Baba Is You.Basically the core of the game is Sokoban: pushing things and moving your character towards a goal. But where the innovation comes is that instead of random crates filled with nothing you are pushing around logical words and their representations. A box BABA, the logic word, is tied to the sheep. Connected with the IS word and YOU, any and all sheep on the screen becomes a player character that takes the same commands at the same time.Puzzle complexity is NOT for the casual audience, but at the same time it gets gradually more difficult to allow experimentation and learning. You can reset any puzzle anytime you want, and you can move 1 step backwards all the way back to the beginning in case you realize that you've screwed something up somewhere in between.What must be said though is that the cute visual style and relaxed ambience sounds are top notch and fit perfectly the puzzle-solving mood. You can always mute it if you get tired of the sounds, too. Personally, I haven't completed the game yet: I take my time, every once in a while firing the game to solve yet another abstract box-pushing puzzle. But it is definitely a great puzzle game for those in the market for one."
4449,2604,Smart and Cool is Baba.Baba is You.
4450,2604,Wonderful puzzles.

4455,2604,"Already a challenge, but great. If you're looking for a challenging puzzle game, try this, it has weird interactions with everything, and it goes deeper than you thing. Its a great mind- of a game id recommend it greatly."
4456,2604,This is a master class of puzzle gaming. You owe it to yourself to play this game.
4457,2604,I actually had to use my two remaining brain cells to actually solve the game puzzles.
4458,2604,"If you like puzzles, this is a mandatory purchase. Difficulty ranges from easy to headsplitting and you're allowed to complete it in pretty much any order you want. It's a charming and unique experience, the sort of thing that only comes around once in a very long while. Get.BABAISBEST"
4459,2604,One of the most challenging games I ever played.Certainly deserves most innovative gameplay award of 2019.

4465,2604,the character looks like small chungus lol
4466,2604,"Baba is You is an astonishing puzzle game, the likes never seen before. Not only did they create such an innovative gimmick, they expanded upon it and layered it on a smooth learning-curve, that encourages creativity and fun experimentation. As of the date of this review, there is some unnoficial forms of level editor, but the devs say an official one will be implemented very soon, which will greatly increase this game wonderfulness."
4467,2604,"Not gonna sing the praises of Baba, because other people already do that enough. I just think it's a neat game with a cool concept and well worth the price."

4473,2603,Very creative and unique game mechanic with puzzling level design. An ideal game to play during longer queues.
4474,2603,GAME IS GOOD
4475,2603,"This is, quite possibly, the best puzzle game I've ever played. This game easily teaches you every mechanic it uses, and at first it seems simple. But every single one can and will completely change up how you need to think of and look at the puzzle. Every mechanic is unique and interesting, and there is absolutely a surplus of them to work with. It would take a lot of effort for any puzzle game to beat Baba Is You."
4476,2603,"I am so fascinated by this game, but not just to play it, but what is underneath and behind. How did this game come to be? It is so simple, yet the deep is the well. Drink full and descend.I don't know what more I could add that I am sure other people have already said. I've just barely breached the surface and really looking forward to diving into what this game means and playing it so much more."
4477,2603,"It's becoming a headache when you get more difficult puzzles that may require long time to solve, but it's still worth it when you combine simple graphics and great music."
4478,2603,Tis very good and simple gameYet every time i play it i want to rip myself open :)Very very good puzzle game though.

4489,2603,The art is adorable and the puzzles are fun and challenging. It's a lot of logical and visual thinking and it's fun to call friends over and have them try and figure out a puzzle you're stuck on. They always get sucked in despite not meaning to.
4490,2603,"If you put science, programming, mathematics and philosophy into a stew, you get Baba.I'm only writing a review so I get the fancy Steam rewards.The trailers and screenshots do not lie. It's a good game and lives up to its promises. It's difficult. It's fun."
4491,2603,Game is Good
4492,2603,"Very fun innovative game! Definitely recommend at least looking into this one, it has one of the most novel mechanics I have ever seen in a puzzle game, and the really pushes it to insane levels in the endgame. Play this game if you want a tough puzzle that will seriously make you scratch your head."

4505,2603,It's a good game that everyone should enjoy.
4506,2603,"(9.5/10)This is probably the most singularly unique/original puzzle game I have ever played.  Its going for a cute vibe and starts you off easy as you begin to learn the ropes of how to manipulate the rules of the world.  It can get fiendishly difficult however and you may sometimes get stuck trying to think sideways when instead you need to think upside-down, inside-out and cross dimensionally instead.  Still, the satisfaction when you do finally crack the inscrutable logic of a particularly frustrating puzzle and manage to walk to the flag, or walk the flag to you, or just decide the flag doesn't mean anything and win with a door instead can't be over-stated.Baba is you. Everything is Baba. Baba is win."
4507,2603,This game made me realize i'm more stupid than I thought.
4508,2603,"This game is simply amazing. Innovative gameplay, simple yet can get very complex, mind-bending puzzles and the most fun I've had with a puzzle game for a while, maybe ever. It's also great to play this with friends, like it's a party game, while everyone tries to come up with solutions to the puzzles together. It's great! Just wish there was some sort of level creator or mod support, the possibilities are endless. If you like different and cool games, you owe yourself to play this."

4514,2603,"This game will keep you preoccupied for hours on end if you want to solve the entirety of its levels. Sometimes BABA isn't YOU, but that's okay because YOU can be something else, including some things you'd never even think of. Fantastic puzzle game, worth full price for puzzle solving enthusiasts."
4515,2603,It's been a while since a game made has made me feel as though I had mentally regressed to a vegetated state. It just had to look this cute while it did so?Baba is You? You is confused. Baba is Great!
4516,2603,yeah. a must play.
4517,2603,"The best and most innovative ""Sokoban-like"" puzzle game."
4518,2603,Good game make brain go hurt
4519,2603,"Baba is You is a very exciting and interesting game because of the possibility to ""define the rules"" by interacting with the game elements, which I think to be a very creative concept. The levels are getting more and more difficult, which makes it neither too hard at the beginning nor too easy in the following levels. If you really like solving puzzles, I would highly recommend this game to you."

4536,2603,"This is a really good puzzle game. It has pretty unique game mechanics and I recommend it to people who are looking for a ""think outside the box"" type of challenge. Also note that programmers are probably going to be a bit better at this than others, since a lot of the game's logic forces you to think in similar ways. I think programmers will have an easier time adjusting, at the very least."
4537,2603,"This game brought me joy,With its color and heart.In solving its puzzles,I gladly took part.My mind has been bent,My resolve was tested.But I fought my way through,And the challenges were bested.Would I recommend the game?That is certainly true.I give a 10/10 toBaba Is You"

4570,2603,A new take on puzzle games with innovative and fun mechanics were you move around and change the various rules of the game.
4571,2603,"I remember seeing this game as a cool little indie game on a GDQ Random Game Race; I'm glad to see it come so far!From small indie game to Most Innovative Gameplay award winner, it's crazy!After all, how can this game not be the award winner?Its puzzles are unlike anything seen before: simple and creative, yet devilishly devious.What else forces you to think so laterally, and to destroy your preconceived notions of how the world works?Nothing parallels the beauty, frustration, and elegance of finally solving a puzzle like this game does.Not to mention its cute artstyle, tranquil soundtrack, and appealing aesthetic.There is only one right choice, BABA IS YOU."

4575,2603,An amazing take on puzzle gamming that explores our relationship between rules and the way we operate them.
4576,2603,Good puzzle game if i wouldnt be so bad at it!
4577,2603,"interesting game ive never played a game quite like this one where it feels like you can do anything but still stumps you time and time again with its well crafted levels. the way the game works is kind of like coding since you tell each object what it can and cannot do or change that object completely, heres a example your in a small room and the door is locked and theres no key in sight the only things in the room are the words door,is,locked,baba,is,you and push but you can rearrange these words to make new rules like door is push so now you can just push the door out of the way and leave but as the game goes on there will be way more object to work with and sometimes changing all the rules is a bad thing"

4593,2603,"One of the best games I've played this year. Decades spent playing video games and still I get surprised and enthralled by new concepts like this game's.While I'd usually say that Baba is You requires a taste for puzzle games, I think on the contrary that it may be the game that will make you like puzzle games."
4594,2603,A complex puzzle game that seems simple at first.
4595,2603,"Good puzzle game. It really makes you think outside the box, because you need to alter the rule of the game."
4596,2603,Clever concept and each mechanic is thoroughly explored without becoming repetitive. Nonlinear level select makes for some interesting overworld shenanigans. Huge sense of satisfaction from solving puzzles that stump you for a while - never seems unfair.
4597,2603,"If you love logic (and challenge), this is the best game ever."

4604,2603,"Wonderful game about thinking outside of the box and changing the rules as you go. Some puzzles will confound, but there's always a 'duh' moment as you figure it out!"
4605,2603,An innovative puzzle game that starts with an easy concept and pushes it to it's limits.
4606,2603,"Baba Is You is really fun but it's quite challenging.  It's hard to believe that a game where you only use the arrow keys and don't have a time limit can be so difficult.  However, the game's challenges are based around changing the rules of each level as opposed to simply trying to reach the exit.As a side note, this game is arguably one of the most successful ""Sokoban"" type games, which there's been dozens of them and many are here on Steam.  Believe it or not, this game was developed by a single developer, Arvi Teikari, who came up with the idea at a game jam while he was still a student at the University of Helsinki.  The game won the Excellence In Design and Best Student Game at the IGF Awards, which is unprecedented."
4607,2603,"Baba Is You is an absolutely brilliant game.Every level completed will make you feel like Albert Einstein on cocaine discovering (E = MC^2) TWO.The constraints of the game are set, explored, then broken, then set, then explored, then broken over and over again.There is no puzzle game that compares."

4622,2603,Brain is Hurt
4623,2603,"definitely my favorite puzzle game I've played so far with the most innovative gimmick for a puzzle game I've played. The biggest reason I enjoy the puzzles in Baba is You is because they're (weirdly) less about how to get to the end and more about how the mechanics allow you to get to the end. It's a very specific difference that is hard to describe, but if you like puzzle games you should 100% pick this up."
4624,2603,"Baba Is You is probably one of my favourite puzzle games. What it lacks in story is makes up for in raw gameplay mechanics. The gameplay is akin to programming language, using keywords to assemble the rules for every level. My only main complaint is that in the later levels the difficulty can spike erratically (though your mileage may vary.)"
4625,2603,Fun.
4626,2603,"Awesome puzzle game. I still haven't beat every level, some of them are very difficult. Simple concept with some interesting ideas. If you liked The Witness, you will probably like this game as well"
4627,2603,One of the most unique puzzle games that I've every played. The large variety of difficult levels and interesting gameplay mechanics will keep you busy for hours.
4628,2603,"hnlich wie Braid, Portal, The Witness, etc. wieder ein grandioses Spiel, in dem man sich abwechselnd wie das grte Genie und der grte Trottel fhlen kann. Genial!"
4629,2603,YOU NOMINATED THIS GAME FOR:THE BEST GAME YOU SUCK AT AWARD
4630,2603,Baba is You.You is Win.
4631,2603,"Baba Is You is, generally, a pretty simple game. Not simple in that the puzzles are easy, but simple in action, direction, and goal.The puzzles start pretty simple, but slowly start ramping up in difficulty as you start to learn new conditions or encounter new obstacles. The conditions in the puzzles, as well as the thinking in the puzzles are reminiscent of software programming at a low level, starting with simple equality statements, with AND and NOT operators appearing soon after. Finding which one takes precedent is part of the experimentation, as well as learning what new modifiers do.This is a kind of game that will definitely take a lot of brain power, and if you ever get frustrated, do not despair! Take a break from the game, stand up and stretch, get a drink of water, and come back at it with a fresh look at the puzzle.If I had the option, I would nominate this game for almost all of the 2019 Steam Awards categories it can apply to, but since I can only nominate this game for one category, I think that Baba Is You deserves my vote for Game of the Year award."
4632,2603,This game is way too smart for my brain.
4633,2603,Amazing logic puzzle game with a fantastic twist. Still haven't beat it because it's so hard for me! 6.5/10
4634,2603,"Very cute game with interesting game play mechanics.The many different words and many different interactions allow for introducing the game chunks at a time and slowly introducing new words and how they cash and interact with other wordsThe game itself is quite difficult once you dive deeper into the game as it gets a little bit META, but otherwise its a cute puzzle game with many different cute and colorful puzzles."
4635,2603,Baba is you and heart
4636,2603,the baba was me all along
4637,2603,I've only played this game for a few minutes and I can already say that the clever design of the puzzles and the cute animation make this game a delight to play and a nice little challenge!
4638,2603,"Fantastic visual style, with clever and interesting puzzles!"
4639,2603,This Is Review
4640,2603,"baba is you is a puzzle game that breaks the rules. literally. you must push around rule blocks in order to create a ruleset that allows a solution. word blocks must be reconfigured to create new rules and dismantle the old ones. It's hard to explain, but it's sokoban with logic operators in an incredibly tight presentation. Some of the later puzzles have taken me days to complete. some of them will frustate you,  some of them will make you laugh, and others are oddly heartwarming. ALL are challenging. I swore to go through this game sans walkthrough and that pushed my complete run to about EIGHT FANTASTIC MONTHS. if you don't mind cheating and actually dedicate yourself to completing puzzles in chunks, you could probably run through it in a month, or a week if you are a genius (or cheat a lil bit). after a while, i played like a crossword or sodoku, just doing one every few days. There are over 215 puzzles, and about 150 of those require real, dedicated thought to complete. I know my play time is short here, but thats because i have finally completed the game on Switch. I have purchased it here to support the dev and snag a sweet soundtrack. Baba is you has meant a lot to me since it's release. Every morning or so as part of my routine, i would fire up a puzzle take a crack at it, and let it sit around in my head over the course of the day. this software is a eureka generator. a few times i would wake up in the middle of the night with the solution. it really gets in your head and changes how you think about rules and operation as a concept.I would reccomend baba is you to anyone looking to listen to some chill tunes, solve riddles and enjoy a good game."
4641,2603,Nominated this game for the most innovative gameplay. It is pretty creative and quite challenge. Typically puzzle games are fairly easy but I struggle with this one in a good way.
4642,2603,this is a great game with innovative mechanics
4643,2603,"you're a little sheep blob solving puzzles, what's not to love?"
4644,2603,"The puzzles are designed in very planned way. It pushes you from the level 1 itself to think and complete the puzzle. After completing each level the proud feeling touches sky high. Moreover, the puzzle system in the game is something ,where you have to create your own instruction and make rules for the game. So, yeah, the game turns out to be a fun puzzle game, which i recommend."
4645,2603,Challenging and fun!
4646,2603,GAMEIS GOODIncredibly unique gameplay with puzzles that will leave you feeling mentally challenged (in a good way).
4647,2603,surprisingly good puzzle game
4648,2603,"An adorable game with simple controls but complex puzzles to solve, Baba Is You attracts players with its charming art style and deceptively-challenging game play. Whether you start it because of how cute Baba is or the unique word arranging mechanic, you'll find yourself hooked. The puzzles, though they may seem limited due to having to use words, provide enough variety to not feel repetitive at all. I fell in love with this game from the trailers, and I've fallen even more for it after playing a bit."

4661,2603,"Baba is You is a puzzle game like no other. Completely systems driven and bonkers with multiple solutions to problems. Its hard to describe just how groundbreaking the game is, but if you like solving puzzles, this is a masterpiece."
4662,2603,Most creative puzzle game since Portal.
4663,2603,Baba is good
4664,2603,"This is a great game. It is easy at first but gets more difficult as you progress. The core mechanics are extremely interesting and can create some really fun situations. Overall, I think this is a great game."
4665,2603,This is the best puzzle game since the Witness.
4666,2603,It's good and also hard as hell.
4667,2603,"An innovative puzzle game. Quick to dive in and out of and while I haven't got very far, there's more variety than I thought there would be for such a simple concept. Definitely recommend."
4668,2603,Do you like puzzles? Do you like suffering in puzzles? This is the drug for you.
4669,2603,"This is the best puzzle game I can imagine. it's rewarding to get stuck, think, and finally solve."

4675,2603,"This game is the best puzzle game since Portal 2. Its fun, challenging and affordable. I can't think of a reason not to buy it."
4676,2603,+ creative puzzle design based on pure logic+ good simplistic visual design+ intuitive playstyle with mindblowing large possibilities+ a lot of amazing easter eggs> game teaches you without any explanatory text instead there are simpler puzzles from which you have to infer the ruleset. 10/10I can recommend it to those who truely love puzzles like me exspecially.
4677,2603,Makes me feel dumb
4678,2603,Super fun game to play and kill time where the puzzles are challenging. The puzzles get progressively harder as you play at a near perfect pacing.
4679,2603,The game devs did break it a lot before the release
4680,2603,"great puzzle game, makes you rage quit, then come back for more"
4681,2603,Me is love and baba is you.
4682,2603,Wonderful game with thought provoking puzzles. Very similar to coding and in a way thats how youll solve each level by rewriting the rules of the game. 10/10
4683,2603,"It's a great game, as can be seen on the trailer. Also, very difficult."
4684,2603,Steam is forcing me to do this
4685,2603,"Defenitely one of the best puzzle games I've ever played. A unique approach to interact with your world, to solve each level.On top, playing through isn't enough, there are many secrets to discover, so keep looking for even more solutions."
4686,2603,"Very hard game, but a lot of fun!"
4687,2603,Great game.
4688,2603,"Extremely hard puzzle game. Everything you need to solve it can be seen right at the start, no RNG involved.Constantly introducing new mechanics to keep you on your toes.Might break your brain."
4689,2603,This is a very clever and difficult puzzle game.
4690,2603,"Great puzzles, and forces you to think outside the box :)"
4691,2603,"AMAZING game design. Every time I complete a puzzle, I either think to myself, ""wow I'm a genius"" or ""wow I'm stupid for not figuring that out sooner""."
4692,2603,my brain hurts
4693,2603,"A great take on puzzle games.Infuriating until you *see* the solution, then you feel like a genius.Great to play on the TV with your partner shouting at you for doing it wrong."
4694,2603,master of piece.
4695,2603,"It is amazing the way that this game will twist your brain in knots trying to figure out the puzzles, and then if you come back to it a little while later, the solution is obvious and makes you feel super smart.  That being said, as the game goes on, it gets more and more difficult to figure out the solutions.  I ended up giving up rather than Googling it every time."
4696,2603,"When programmers forget about gameplay, yet they somehow come up with it. Maybe not complex, but something new and creative."
4697,2603,The puzzles in this adorable game are too much for my tiny mind.I absolutely love it.11/10 - I even made a second save file to try the first puzzles over again as fast as I can.

4699,2603,"Very fun game, makes you think"
4700,2603,"Adventure of lolo alike but its own twistYou bend the rules of each entity of the screen [grass, stone, wall] by giving them a property [push, stop, sink] by arranging words tilesLater levels can lead to real bs solutions, meaning that you have to get a deep understanding of each property""you silly goose! The words can be sank too!""Eitherway pretty satisfying when you find the right solution"

4729,2603,"Welcome to the annual late November Sergiovan review, where I take a look at a game because the Steam Awards will give me invaluable internet points for doing so. Today's review is for the greatest puzzle game since that other puzzle game that was also great, Baba is You.This  game is a masterpiece of puzzles. Buy it now if you like puzzles and staring long and hard at your screen trying to figure out whether you're blind or whether your mom dropped you on your head when you were little. I don't want to say anything else because holy moly this game has a lot of secrets. Just go buy it!"
4730,2603,Great thought provoking puzzle game with both a unique art & gameplay style.
4731,2603,I'm impressed by the simplicity of this game. Definite recommendation for puzzle lovers.
4732,2603,Baba is good!Baba is hard!Baba is :^)
4733,2603,"Based on my experience so far this is an excellent puzzle game, that introduces players to the fun concept of definitions, syntax and maybe a tad bit of coding. Graphics are a bust, but the game doesn't need them. The background music is kinda relaxing and sometimes the whole experience just clicks and you keep finding yourself saying ""aw, just one more level""."
4734,2603,"Amazing puzzle, simple art style and frustrating difficulty.Nothing left to ask for, right?"
4735,2603,A wonderfully confusing puzzle game
4736,2603,one of the best games out there that will blow your mind by how difficult and easy it is at the same time 10/10
4737,2603,Probably the most intelligently designed game I've ever played.
4738,2603,"Very good puzzle game! Clever, simple gameplay, excellent puzzles, challenging and extremely rewarding. Recommended!"
4739,2603,Nice.
4740,2603,The most original puzzle mechanic i've ever seen. So much untapped potential even after the hundreds of puzzles even with meta puzzles within puzzles. This is perfect.
4741,2603,"Really innovative puzzler, really well done progression, I suck at it, and I feel smart when I solve a level, I can't ask more from a puzzle game."
4742,2603,EPIC

4748,2603,"This is an extremely good game, and I would reccomend it to everyone"
4749,2603,A very good and difficult puzzle game
4750,2603,Baba is Awesome
4751,2603,"deep down, we're all baba"
4752,2603,Baba is you is an axcelent game of puzzles. It makes you crack your head! It would be great to see more games of this developer.
4753,2603,"The game's style is so cute! That pixel style suits the game so much - and it goes so well with the music!Despite the game being adorable in a certain way, it's immensely hard. Like, this game is big brain time. I still didn't beat the whole game, but that doesn't discourage me to give up. If you love hard puzzles, I definitely recommend this game. Its unique playstyle is what makes this game so special."
4754,2603,"Great puzzle game that ranges from super simple; to bashing your face into the desk and asking yourself, ""HOW!"""
4755,2603,"Let it be known that I'm very dumb at this game and I have no clue what goes on most of the time. I heard that it can be a computer in of itself? Still by far one of the best puzzlers in the market right now. It stumped my friend on the second level, and he got hooked by it since."
4756,2603,I don't get this game and I love it
4757,2603,"It's not *that* hard to think outside the box, but then suddenly you get to define what the ""box"" is, and things go south. Way south. This is the Baba is You experience.One day I'll become smart enough to revisit this game and beat it. Or that's the hope, at least."
4758,2603,Great game that I suck at
4759,2603,The game is more confusing than the report on Epstein's Death.
4760,2603,"Easily my choice for the most innovative gameplay award. It also could have been given the ""best game i suck at""-Award, but the innovative gameplay seems to be the more fitting one for this title. It is brutally difficult but also incredibly creative."
4761,2603,
4762,2603,i suck at this game but even having only played it for 3 hours i already love it
4763,2603,Puzzles are always fun. The ones where rules are not static and can be influenced by player actions - even more so.
4764,2603,One of the best!
4765,2603,"I love this game. Existential questions raised by it still haunt me to this day. Also, very fun. You end up wondering if you solved some puzzles the way that they were initially designed, or an alternate way."
4766,2603,Baba is Good
4767,2603,"Baba Is You is a good puzzle game if you have enough patience.Moving around text to create rules that the world must then abide by is genius, and many of the puzzles reflect this genius in their solutions.And some don't.Most levels are challenges where you must use the mechanics in a clever way, and they are very satisfying to solve. They force you to apply the knowledge you have about the mechanics in new ways. You'll have to think outside the box, and finally solving a puzzle like this is great.Unfortunately, there are several levels where the 'outside-the-box' application of a mechanic that you're supposed to use is incredibly unintuitive and almost impossible to discover without trial-and-error. These puzzles are not fun, and I've have looked up the solutions of a few puzzles like this (You can usually tell that the level kinda sucks when you look up the solution and know that you never would've even gotten close to figuring it out).This complaint does seem like I'm just bad at solving the puzzles (and perhaps it is), but since I can solve most of the levels as long as I think hard enough, I definitely feel as though there are just a few random levels that really could be more clear.Overall, however, Baba Is You is a great puzzle game."

4775,2603,"one of the best logic/puzzle gamesif you love puzzle games you should definitely play thisthe game mechanic is simple but so ingenious. the puzzles are well designed and can get really hard really quickly, even with only a few puzzle elements. but it rarely gets repetitive/boring and is very good at introducing new concepts along the way it forces you to think outside the boxalso soundtrack and visuals are great, so that's a plus"
4776,2603,Brilliant!
4777,2603,"jogo de puzzle muito bom, acho a progresso de dificuldade meio acentuada mas ainda assim  bem divertido. (7.5/10)"
4778,2603,"Baba is you is a wonderful puzzle game that takes a new twist where the properties of objects can be modified by pushing words together. Great game to start up every once in a while and get a puzzle or two done.There will be a level editor and steam workshop added soon, so there should be a lot of replayability in that update.However, one of my issues with the game is that the difficulty in each world does ramp up a bit too fast so it goes from ""hey, here is a new word modifier. have fun with it"" to the next level ""Here is a super difficult puzzle with that modifier. good luck."" I would like to see a level or two between that increases in difficulty so it feels more gradual."
4779,2603,REVIEW is POSITIVEBABA is MAD and GLAD

4783,2603,Great puzzle game with good difficulty. If you can't figure out the solution to a level you can usually move on to a different level in order to progress. Also stuff gets pretty crazy towards the end of the game.

4822,2603,"A truely unique puzzle game, where you can literally push the rules of the game around. It makes for some exquisite, mindbending gameplay that is a lot of fun. Can be frustrating at times, but when you solve a puzzle, it feels very rewarding indeed!"

4844,2603,Refresh your brain with 'Baba Is You'
4845,2603,"Brilliant concept through simple means. It gets very challenging very quickly. There are multiple ways to solve the problems which I really like.  Understanding the non-communicative concept between things is a bit confusing but it either tells you the association doesn't make sense, there is no effect, or your just die in which case you only need to hit backspace to undo as many steps as you want."
4846,2603,me is small brain
4847,2603,Probably the most ingenious puzzle game you will ever play.
4848,2603,"This is a fascinating game that takes a classic gameplay system from Sokobon or its ilk and then completely changes how you think about pushing ""blocks"" around on the playfield. At times I found it frustrating and impossible but then a solution would start to form and you wonder how you never came across that solution in the last fifteen minutes of bumbling around and putting any number of phrases together that inevitably always broke the level every other time.It's also impressive how much content there is for someone who really gets into the game. While I can recommend it I got ending credits and played for some hours beyond that but I was satisfied with my experience up to that point. It's worth it just to experience the insanity that is Baba. Baba Is Insanity."

4854,2603,Hard as balls
4855,2603,There is so much content and challenge to be found in this game. They really make the most of the simple gameplay.

I'm only leaving a review for the level 4 Steam Awards badge...so this review might be a bit half-assed but I do love and recommend this game genuinely (hence why I'm voting it for the Steam Awards)That being said though! Fantastic game!! I've never seen a puzzle game that uses it's mechanics like this, let alone with such a beautiful visual style. The puzzles themselves are quite difficult, and make me feel so unreasonably smarter than I am. ITS GOOD buy this game I was not paid to say this :)"

4874,2603,puzzle game masterpiece
4875,2603,Baba Is Good Game
4876,2603,Best puzzle game since Portal 2. It does a great job of being a relaxing time!
4877,2603,You need to think out of the box to do anything in this game. Really nice!
4878,2603,"A wonderful puzzle game that will make your brain melt. The base game has tons of levels that will last you for awhile, but with level editor on it's way the potential of Baba Is You is limitless. The most creative gameplay in a puzzle I've ever experienced."
4879,2603,Great puzzle game which starts easy and make you learn after each level that you pass.
4880,2603,good game
4881,2603,The game that it forces you to think outside the box. literally.
4882,2603,Brain is big. Baba is difficult. Brain is not big.
4883,2603,"A great puzzle game, unlike anything you've played before."
4884,2603,Any game where I can screw myself over by turning all the text into copies of me is pretty good
4885,2603,Wonderful and complex. This game beat my head up. I would keep coming back after hours of struggle on just one level but the payoff of this amazing game was worth it.
4886,2603,hard unique puzzle gameI like it
4887,2603,"Baba is You is one of the most creative puzzle games I've played in a long time. It starts with a simple premise - you build short ""sentences"" that assign properties to various objects. ""FLAG is WIN"" makes flag a win condition, ""ROCK is PUSH"" to, well, push rock out of the way. However, as you progress, game introduces more words to play with and forces you to think out of box. Understanding how those words  really  work and what you can do with them is the most important element of this game. What started as simple ""push few objects here and there"" becomes mind-bending madness of opening doors with rocks(who needs a key anyway), escaping rampaging skulls, making Baba a shapeshifting monstrosity and juggernauting through a level as a giant wall.A must-play for everyone who enjoys puzzle games."
4888,2603,"The best puzzle game of 2019! Seriously, it will twist your mind into a knot and than warp it to another dimension. First, you curse the dev for creating tough puzzles, then you curse yourself for not seeing the obvious but crazy solution."
4889,2603,Really interesting and often quite difficult puzzler
4890,2603,hard
4891,2603,The Tetris Effect of this game is really a wild ride.
4892,2603,Brain melting and super satisfying
4893,2603,"Puzzle game, very 'think outside the box' kind, quite literally."
4894,2603,A challenging and fun puzzle game with a unique and interesting mechanic that has a surprising depth.
4895,2603,Baba Is You is a game about changing who you are and the world around you to reach your goals.
4896,2603,When you try to be so meta you get a headache.
4897,2603,its a good game i enjoy it... but it makes me feel like an idiot

4900,2603,VERY challenging but it's SO WORTH getting through it. 100% recommend
4901,2603,If baba = likelike = win
4902,2603,"Feels like work. Hard work.But I like the work I do, so it's welcome work.The puzzling part is the fun part, not the actual solution.Finding the answer is usually more of a ""finally"", than an ""oh wow"".So if you don't like the puzzling itself, it probably won't stimulate much.The best puzzles are those with many moving parts that allow multiple solutions, many of which are surely not intended, but no less encouraged.Rewards both analytical minds and those who think out of the box.Encourages attempting things just to tease out how things work.Makes you question your sanity.Makes others question your sanity.Makes you say things like ""BaBa can't be Me, because Me is You"".Makes you believe that the above statement is true."
4903,2603,10/10
4904,2603,Different and intuitive game design in the best way possible. Only con is that it makes me feel stupid.

4910,2603,Baba Is You and FunIsHard is Win
4911,2603,"Ive fully completed every level in this game and i have to say, it is one of the most well crafted puzzle games i have played. The game does a good job of teaching new mechanics, and its on the the player to get creative when they cant find an obvious solution. One specific level very late into the game, which i would consider probably the hardest; the solution is literally mind boggling. I can't recommend this game enough."
4912,2603,Please help me beat this difficult puzzle game. It's really doing my head in.

4933,2603,"Baba Is Fun isYouNo, really, Baba is you is fun, for the most part. Half of the interest and intrigue for the game is trying to find the weird ways to win a level, especially when you look at a solution and go, ""No, that can't possibly work..."" and then do it and it does. Or maybe it doesn't, but it does something you didn't expect, and that gives you new ideas on what you can do."
4934,2603,Brain Is Hurt
4935,2603,"Cute game, interesting gameplay. You really have to think outside the box for this one. Figuring out the solutions is very satisfying and, when you think of it, so obvious you'll want to bang your head against the desk. Don't, you'll need it to beat the next puzzle."

4946,2603,"This is the quintessential puzzle game. Baba Is You takes a simple concept and repeatedly expands upon it with interchangeable moving parts, creating a seemingly infinite number of scenarios. Just when you think you've seen it all, yet another novel situation presents itself. A must-play for problem solvers and puzzle enthusiasts seeking a good challenge."

4948,2603,"Perhaps the cleverest puzzle game I've ever played. The game is superb at introducing creative new mechanics, and then pushing them to the limit. Every level has a unique solution, it never feels like you're doing the same thing twice. Baba Is You is a very challenging, but extremely rewarding experience that deserves a spot among the best puzzle games of all time."

4962,2603,"I have a Stockholm Syndrome relationship with this game. I feel like it's bullying me for being too difficult (or maybe I'm just too stupid), but then I keep thinking about the potential solutions the whole day long and coming back to it again to get beaten."

4975,2603,"Baba Is Cute.The game functions around rules that are laid out as blocks of text in the level and you solve puzzles by moving the text around to change those rules.A wall gets in your way? Just change the rule that says walls stop you, and you can go right through!The puzzles are cute and clever, but they get difficult fast and I never beat the end level.Glad to have played the game regardless though. :)"

4986,2603,Can't believe after decades of video-game history this level of innovation can still happen. I can't remember any game that resembles this gameplay. Congratulations to the team!
4987,2603,BABA HAS LOVE AND BABABABA IS WEAK
4988,2603,Review is original.
4989,2603,This game is designed in a clean early video game style and the game play challenges you to think broadly in order to complete the well designed levels. It has been a very long time since I had so much fun with a puzzle game.
4990,2603,"This game is so quirky and complex, and brain bending in the right ways. If you like puzzle games, you'll love this game, it takes the usual puzzle game fare and proceeds to break your understanding of how games work to create a brain scratcher of a game.Thinking outside of the box is very much encouraged, as you will not just be expected to find the correct sequence to finish a puzzle. It is seldom that simple. You will use word crafting, move planning, and outright ignoring the boundaries of typical video games to do some really satisfying, loopy puzzle solutions. It can be very difficult to wrap your head around the game, even if you are good at thinking unconventionally.If you have a lot of patience and a disposition for exploration of mechanics, this recommendation could not be more in favor of your tastes. For those who lack patience, you will get stuck, you will be left staring at the screen or testing moves for a long time, but the novelty of Baba's puzzles and mechanics are one of a kind as far as I know.I feel the weakest point of Baba is that the video scaling is really poor if you play around with the resolutions too much, everything becomes a blob that melds together in really nasty ways, and ruins the retro 2d aesthetic I tend to enjoy. This game is in sore need of a pixel perfect scaling feature or an easier way to use standardized resolution options that don't make everything look crappy. The music is fairly forgettable too."
4991,2603,is gud
4992,2603,Doge con su orejita volteada
4993,2603,Baba is wow
4994,2603,"A very clever and well-designed puzzle game. It's one of those games where you'll spend an hour trying to find a solution, and then feel like an idiot because it was obvious in hindsight. Some of the later levels are slightly frustrating because there are so many different objects that it can be hard to even wrap your head around anything."
4995,2603,I consider myself pretty smart and good at puzzle games.This game defeated me...Baba Is Good!
4996,2603,"The most interesting little puzzler I've played in a long while. The fundamental mechanics are new and mind-bending, and result in many interesting solutions."
4997,2603,Baba Is You are not prepared.
4998,2603,Do you like puzzle games that are smart and devious?Puzzle games that make you want to gnaw off your own arms in frustration?Boy do I have the game for you. The price tag is well worth it and this one of the best puzzle games ever created in recent history.

5007,2603,"As I just nominated this game for ""most innovative gameplay"" I might as well review it.Frankly put this is a puzzle game which is brilliant in it's simplicity. The concepts are intuitive and easy to grasp, meaning all of the difficulty comes from actually using logic to solve the puzzles. It's a very hard game but it's also very satisfying when you do solve a puzzle. It makes you feel clever, until the next puzzle when you feel dumb again."

5014,2603,"I only know good things to say about this game. It has an innovative gameplay, relatively long play time (after over 50 hours of gameplay I still have some puzzles to solve) and the puzzle design is outstanding. I always forget time when playing this game and often catch myself spending hours thinking over a certain puzzle, but it always feels like 5 minutes to me. The only ""negative"" thing to say about this game would be that the puzzles are increasing very fast in difficulty, but if you like challenges (like I do) and puzzle games in general, I think that this game is a must have. 10/10"
5015,2603,Real innovative puzzle game.
5016,2603,"Can't recommend this game enough. Best puzzle game I've ever played. You owe it to yourself to give it a try, even if you don't generally like puzzle games. Every single of 200+ levels is cleverly designed in such a way that solutions are always dead simple, yet, you are constantly frustrated by the fact that it seems obvious to you that this particular level clearly has no solution at all. But time and time again, the game proves you wrong, and amuses you in a positive way. Baba is goty"
5017,2603,Game is good
5018,2603,"This is an amazing little puzzle game. Even after I've finished a level, it's fun to play with the mechanics available in each level. I've run into many hilarious situation where I've ""broken"" levels into amusing messes of strange rules."
5019,2603,10/10
5020,2603,Baba is 10/10
5021,2603,"An incredibly clever puzzle game, with adorable visuals and a great soundtrack to boot!"
5022,2603,"Fantastic game, incredibly creative. The system of rules is technically impressive and often subverts your expectations. I'm a total brainlet and finished the main game (no post-game) in 35 hours. Some tips: Don't listen to anything in the background, and take no mechanic for granted."
5023,2603,Think about that time you felt dumb for not realizing the simplest thing right in front of you. Multiply by 500. That's how you feel at the end of any Baba Is You level.10/10 would feel dumb again

5032,2603,that little bunny guy is just so cute
5033,2603,Baba is You is a good game.
5034,2603,"The rule changing system is an extremely powerful, original, and interesting puzzle mechanic. Very rarely does a game allow you to have this level of freedom and control. The levels are very creative and feel rewarding to solve."
5035,2603,"This game is Turing-complete, which as far as programming puzzle games go, probably means it's doing something right."
5036,2603,baba is game of the year
5037,2603,Baba is You is one of the most innovative gameplay games in 2019. Pushing words together to create actions is such a novel and fun concept. We have quite a lot of fun playing this game in our office during break.
5038,2603,"Cool game which forces you to think outside the box, then push the box, and do some strange things with it!For me, it's the best gameplay innovation in 2019! A bit hard sometimes, but you are so happy when you found a solution... :)"
5039,2603,but I wanna be mama
5040,2603,"A fun, code-based/block pushing puzzle game that makes you think outside the box. And the wall. And the water. But not the grass. Grass is stop."
5041,2603,"This game has a concept unlike any I've seen before. With only a handful of mechanics, the game manages to showcase incredible depth in the ways these can be utilized. Each level has been handcrafted around the mechanics to extract every bit of potential from them. Everything in a level is there for a reason; a fact that will be the greatest clue on the way to beating any level. Still, finding the one permutation that works out of the hundreds possible will push your brain cells to their limit. Nothing beats the feeling you get from finally clearing a level that has eluded you for hours. Baba Is You is truly one of the greatest puzzle games ever created."

5044,2603,"Filled with 'big brain' moments where you're doing something completely unrelated and you realize ""Whoa! I got it!"" Then you just have to play."
5045,2603,"Painfully difficult, but something to take with you to bed and mull over. That is, until you wake up suddenly, rush to the computer, and finish the puzzle that was bugging you for days. Very hard - but fun."
5046,2603,This game takes thinking outside the box to a whole new level. Think about the box. Become the box. Box is win.
5047,2603,"Amazing, unique, mind-bending, extremely difficult at times but equally rewarding. Also cute art style and music."

5059,2603,Wonderful puzzle game. Wide range of easy to insanely difficult puzzles.
5060,2603,baba is good
5061,2603,"This game is absolutely brilliant. I have not played a single game like it. This game has a very unique concept, bendable rules that are formed with sequences of words that allow you to change the way the game works. I'm not sure how great that sounds to you, but I can tell you that one, it is fantastic, and two, you'd be hard pressed to find a better execution of a concept than this. I can't stress enough how amazingly well done this game was and how good the game is. The only caveat is that a few levels seem unfairly difficult (Weird mechanics that you had a very low chance of figuring out were possible) but I have only had to look up maybe 5 or so levels out of the whole game. It takes time and patience to figure out some of the harder levels, but the feeling you get when you finally see the solution is worth it. I can't recommend this enough. Get it."
5062,2603,Yes
5063,2603,"Few games offer true lateral thinking the way Braid or Portal do. Baba is You is one of those. Even better, its difficulty curve is deceptively progressive. At first, it looks like the game is never going to be difficult. This is a lie. It quickly because treacherously difficult. Furthermore, each area encompasses levels that require a variety of difficulty skills. The number of rules, verbs and pieces constantly grow, which means the game remains surprising and fresh as it goes on. But, again, after a while, it's punishingly hard."
5064,2603,nice
5065,2603,"Great, challenging puzzle game."
5066,2603,Puzzle is hard
5067,2603,Tricky and fun.
5068,2603,Very fun & innovative puzzler that takes full advantage of being a video game by allowing you to reconfigure the rules of the game at will via sliding blocks that establish game rules.
5069,2603,"A clever puzzle game that has loads of charm, challenge and a unique feel. It has a retro esthetic that helps you focus on the puzzle solving, without unnecessary distractions. Despite that, it still has a unique visual design like that of retro games. If you enjoy unconventional and clever puzzles, be sure to pick this game up  highly recommended."
5070,2603,not Baba is not lit
5071,2603,Its a really good puzzle game with very creative puzzles and a relaxing soundtrack.
5072,2603,Great Puzzle game with really interesting levels and mechanics

5074,2603,yeslool
5075,2603,"its too hard for my feeble brain to understand,"
5076,2603,GAME IS GOOD
5077,2603,"Baba Is You has been a real treat to play. The art and music are endlessly charming, and the unique concept of changing the game's rules to solve puzzles not only works well in practice, but it has been executed and explored in such detail and with such creativity, it's mind blowing.I've been slowly playing this game for the last eight months, without the use of any guides or hints. When playing this way, Baba Is You ranks up there as one of the most difficult games I've ever played. I have sometimes been stuck on a puzzle for over a month, but when the answer would eventually come to me, it was always very satisfying due to how cleverly this game makes use of its ideas and mechanics. The solution to even the game's most difficult puzzles is always simple, requiring you to become very creative and think way outside the box to discover mechanics and interactions you didn't know the game had. Sometimes I thought I outsmarted the game when I would come up with a strange solution to a puzzle, only to find a later puzzle featuring that same obscure concept.The amount of content in this game is very impressive, with more than 200 puzzles. It will stretch your brain to its absolute limits and then some.I really can't overstate how much I enjoyed this game. It's brilliant beyond all comprehension. This is the best puzzle game I've ever played by a mile. It's unquestionably the Game of the Year, and it's probably the best game I've played in the last 5-10 years."
5078,2603,"Very nice, can be frustrating, but the reward of figuring out a puzzle is amazing."
5079,2603,"4 places cleared so far. It's a very well made puzzle game, among the best I've played. Logic based and so far, the levels do not take a lot of time by doing excessive amount of work. They can take time to figure out, but this means they are easy to get back to another day if not solved today. Like puzzles should be. Worth full price if you're into this type of game.Update: 100 levels cleared and finished the ""A Way Out"" level which lets you finish the game without completing the whole game. Very smart decision by the devs to let the player get some sort of closure. The game is hard in the later stages and get be frustrating because of this. It couldn't be fairer though and there's always a solution to the puzzle. I'm not sure I'll continue on beyond this, but if you like logic based puzzle games, this is the one to get. Highly recommended."
5080,2603,it really is the dark souls of puzzle games
5081,2603,very clever
5082,2603,creative game!
5083,2603,interesting puzzler
5084,2603,uwu
5085,2603,"A truly excellent single player puzzle game.Based around the idea that no rule is a given, and all rules can be changed. Gameplay is Sokoban like, with no time constraints and restricted movement. Later levels become particularly brain-melting, using extremely meta and unexpected (though never unfair or hidden) mechanics. I would recommend this to literally anyone who enjoys puzzles.Graphics, controls and overall style are simple and functional, with gameplay focused solely on the glorious puzzling. The soundtrack is especially of note, being simple, but strangely compelling.Could expect something between 30-70 hours of playtime to fully complete official levels, depending on ability, and willingness to look up hints/solutions."
5086,2603,"Great puzzle game. Amazingly tricky, without being unfair in any way."
5087,2603,Completely unique game with challenging puzzles.
5088,2603,baba is not not fun
5089,2603,Best puzzle game 2019
5090,2603,its really hard but that makes it feel even better when you manage to solve the puzzles
5091,2603,Cool
5092,2603,Its a fun puzzle game and you need to think about every move you make so you don't get stuck making the wrong move. You can make things to backwards so its easy so solve if you get stuck. Fun game overall and I recommend it!
5093,2603,"Amazing, original, completely unlike anything you've played before. Hard though. It's for people with enough patience to puzzle it out."
5094,2603,"Baba Is You is a perfect videogame in that it is a puzzler that constantly teaches you new things and pushes you to be inventive. There are bigger games out there. There are AAA titles, but as an atmospheric indie puzzler, Baba is close to flawless. A few puzzles expect you to use mechanics that weren't introduced to you, like in the Prison level, but don't doubt that this is a -very- good game. Especially for the price.Finding solutions in this game can make you wonder if you solved the puzzle in an unintended manner. Did you break the game? Did it glitch? Or is the game simply so well designed, that it constantly stays a step ahead of you?This gives you the feeling of the game designer reading your intentions - and vice versa; a rare and beautiful connection that I haven't felt in a game since Undertale.TL;DR Baba Is Perfect"
5095,2603,is GUD as 
5096,2603,Great level design.
5097,2602,Will make you realize just how stupid you are while at the same time making you feel like a genius. Not unlike actual programming.
5098,2602,"It's a good puzzle game but it pretty quickly abandons the ""break the rules"" aesthetic to become a standard puzzle game that accrues new rules faster than it teaches them. The style is great but it would have benefited a lot from a more gradual difficulty curve to teach the various rules before piling them on, even if that meant abandoning a little variety."
5099,2602,I have no clue what I'm doing but I've made it like 2 steps into the game and I'm already lost.
5100,2602,"Where most puzzle games tend to be easy and then ramp up to medium when they end at 4 hours, having barely explored their mechanics, this game has dozens of hours of great puzzles that emerge from a simple set of mechanics. This is easily the best puzzle game since The Witness."
5101,2602,This game is fantastic! It's so fun to play.
5102,2602,This game is amazing
5103,2602,Possibly my favorite puzzle game ever.  Very difficult but rewarding.
5104,2602,"It's just a really fun and innovate puzzle game, I don't really have much else to say about it though."
5105,2602,"Tried hard to enjoy this game as I am a fan of puzzle games. I'm also a retired computer programmer, so when I looked at the videos for this game I thought if would be perfect for me.Unfortunately, after the first few levels, the game became pure frustration. I think the reason I didn't enjoy the game is my programmer/analytic brain  - I want clear rules and if by those rules a solution should work, it has to work, otherwise the game is a failure.This game reminds me of a bad computer adventure game, where there are multiple logical ways of solving a puzzle, but only one works."
5106,2602,"Very frustrating, like a good puzzle game should be."
5107,2602,Well thought out puzzles with interesting solutions and great progression. Not too slow or too quick.
5108,2602,"Severe case of ""out of the box thinking"".It's a mind-bending, cerebrum-melting puzzle game, where the premise is quite simple: every rule that defines the level is also a part of the level itself and can be interacted with.The consequences of the above are massive - I wholeheartedly invite you to delve into this game and see for yourself (and have your head scorched from intense thinking).DEFINITELY recommend."
5109,2602,"Easily the best and most complex puzzle game I've ever played, designed in a brilliant way to build a stepping stone path of ideas as you learn how the world works and add new tools to your belt. It feels like there is always a new puzzle to uncover and another secret to explore, with each solution making you feel like a genius. I could not recommend this game enough to someone who enjoys critical and lateral thinking, not to mention the adorable art style. 11/10"

5112,2602,Just a good ass puzzle game.
5113,2602,"This game works your brain more than your average puzzle game, and it has a cute style. It keeps surprising you with mechanics you don't expect.11/10 mechanics.9/10 difficulty.10/10 artstyleBaBa is best.AND BABA IS DONE"
5114,2602,"I'm not going to lie to you. I am too stupid to play this game.If you're good at puzzle games you've probably already played this, if you haven't, you'll probably like it.If you're dumb like me, steer clear."
5115,2602,"This is the most mind bending game I have ever played, and probably the best puzzle game I have ever played. It's quite possibly even the best game I have ever played period.In Baba Is You spatial puzzles are elegantly combined with lateral thinking puzzles. The puzzles are designed to explicitly test your curiosity and challenge your intuitions, giving you a very satisfying feeling of revelation when the puzzle pieces finally fit together and you understand how the level works. The puzzles also reward you for exploring by showing just how devoted the game is to its concept. It's incredibly satisfying to wonder ""wait a minute, if I do this, what would that actually do?"" and to have my curiosity rewarded with some pretty incredible surprises.The game seems to go out of it's way to restrict some puzzle solutions, but many levels can still be solved in a few different ways, so it only restricts the gameplay just enough to keep everything interesting and to keep the solutions to the levels unique and satisfying. Often times after looking at a level that at first seemed easy I would have to rethink everything about that level, and sometimes everything about the mechanics themselves, in order to solve it. This has the effect of slowly teaching you how the mechanics work without ever needing to resort to hand holding.A word of warning though, some levels can be very challenging, so be prepared for that. Its a good thing the levels are so easy to pick up and put down, because Ive got stuck on some of the trickier levels. You also unlock enough levels in normal play that if you get really stuck its always possible to just move on and come back to a level that has you stumped with a fresh mind later.As a final note, I think this game has genuine merit as a general educational tool to introduce someone to some concepts in programming and logic and it encourages creative thinking. I actually think I'm better for having played it.10/10"
5116,2602,"This game surprised me in how many different twists it had. I won't go so far as to say that EVERY level had a new trick, but it did happen with striking regularity. Playing through this game isn't just a matter of grasping a few methods and applying them on increasingly bigger and more complicated levels - it is a journey of discovery, where you are constantly challenged to figure out a new way to combine the elements at your disposal."
5117,2602,Amazing
5118,2602,"Fun small game that get's progressively harder, meaning it's a challenge or good for anyone that enjoys a good puzzle.Has a lot of content to."
5119,2602,"Just got this for a Sunday afternoon with the family.Very smart and enjoyable. Dont let the graphics fool you, this game is definitely worth it if you like puzzle games."
5120,2602,"What a fantastic, creative puzzle game! Even when I get stuck, I feel driven to keep going and figure it out. I score it 11 / 10, A++, three thumbs up!"
5121,2602,Brain hurt ouch oh no ugh
5122,2602,"A creative and charming puzzle. It gives you that ""well  me that actually worked!?"" feeling and that alone is worth the price. Also is super fun to play coop with the gf. I don't know it gives you that vibe you got from getting a new game on the super nintendo.... just plain fun."
5123,2602,"A good puzzle game to test your assumptions. Maybe you thought walls were always impenetrable. Maybe you thought there could be only one Baba. Occasionally this will bust your brain, but the puzzles are always fair."

5128,2602,I bought and played this game on my Nintendo Switch first but I bought it again on steam for a charity livestream I was part of because it would be more convenient for that. I'm mentioning this because I've played this game a lot on that system. I originally bought this game because the game looked cute and that my family would enjoy the game. It's very simple to understand and my family have enjoyed playing it too! It's very relaxing but really makes you think. I enjoy this game a lot and I'm happy I bought it again!

5133,2602,Worth every heller!
5134,2602,"This game reminds me of countless browser games with clever puzzle concepts over 30 levels. However Baba Is You takes a clever concept and makes over 200 levels while systematically and logically expanding the concept again and again and again. The complexity is quite insane and in the end, every level achieved feels uniquely rewarding."
5135,2602,"Unbelievably good puzzle game, I have about 4 levels left until full completion, but they are too hard..."

5138,2602,"Fun game :)But in all seriousness, this is a great game, it manages to steadily increase its difficulty while maintaining the fun as you advance through the game. Puzzles are unique and offer new challenges with every few levels."

There is so much to do that even if you get stuck on a puzzle, you can move on and come back later. The amount of content in this game is crazy.It is a very challenging game towards the end (which I consider a good thing), and it is insanely rewarding to finish a puzzle you've been racking your brain over for the past few days."

5150,2601,Baba is cool
5151,2601,"My brain hurts.Puzzle games aren't my thing, but this game just takes the cake.  It's closer to learning a programming language than it is solving a jigsaw puzzle.If you like game design, programming, puzzle solving, or all three, play this game.My brain hurts."
5152,2601,Mindblowing! Innovative! Very very long...
5153,2601,"Don't get me wrong, the game isn't bad and the first levels are interesting and fun, but the later levels are way too difficult and to solve them you often have to use strategies that more feel like abusing glitches and less like developing a valid strategy. It would also be better if levels had multiple solutions, but unintended solutions are often patched out instead of embracing them.Another problem is that you often have tons of available levels at a time, but many of these levels are pretty much unsolvable as you haven't solved the level yet that introduces the required strategy. But you don't really know which levels requires which level as a prerequisite. That could have been solved by making the levels more linear.The biggest problem so far is that the game doesn't really teach you. The first puzzles are easy enough on their own and don't require tutorials or anything like that, but the later puzzles are really hard and it's frustrating to be stuck because you can't figure out a new and unintuitive mechanic on your own. Giving little hints through a story and again making it more clear and linear, would improve the game a lot. Kinda like how the Portal series teaches the mechanics through the story and little interactions without giving away the solutions to the puzzles.To add to that, graphics and music are fine, but they could definitely be better and the music gets repetetive after some time."
5154,2601,Yes.
5155,2601,Baba Is Recommended
5156,2601,"I'm sure you've heard this all before in other reviews etc, but Baba is You really is a brilliant game. It's a simple idea; you can push words together to change the rules. For example, BABA + is + YOU means that you control the character Baba. WALL + is + STOP means that the walls stop you from passing them. Remove a term from ""WALL is STOP"" and suddenly the walls don't stop you anymore and you can walk through them. Perhaps you want to become the wall, and with some careful fiddling, you can!All the levels in Baba is You are puzzles based around these rules, and it isn't as easy (or difficult!) as it might sound. I found it pretty easy to get my head around the concept, and the game is full of creative ideas. When a new word comes up, it's exciting, and though I haven't finished yet I'm going to try my best to get there.BABA is GOOD."
5157,2601,"Easily one of the most creative and mind-bending puzzle games I've ever played. I personally wasn't quite able to wrap my head around the later portions, which is why I haven't been able to finish it, but that should be a testament to just how good it is at testing and breaking your logic. Plus it's super cute."
5158,2601,"A great puzzle game. Hard puzzles that are fun once you figure out what all you can do. That's what I like most is that they don't give you all the info up front, you have to really think the problems through."
5159,2601,good
5160,2601,"Really damn hard, but fun puzzles. Sometimes it's too hard, but that's why you can skip levels!"

5164,2601,challenging and rewarding 15/21
5165,2601,
5166,2601,too great
5167,2601,This game is very interesting
5168,2601,"It's a brilliant puzzle game that plays like nothing else out there.Now, the game starts off easy, but still very fun. It's pretty open, allowing you to solve puzzles in a variety of ways and learn all the small intricacies of its mechanics.Later on though, Baba is You becomes brutally hard. Now, I'm not a master of puzzle games, but I wouldn't call myself terrible. Well Baba is You kicked my butt only a few areas in. I cannot imagine what kind of stuff happens later.Of course, this extra difficulty also means that the levels become progressively more linear, with only one way to solve them (occasionally there might be a second). I feel like the openness of the earlier levels and all the ways we could play with the mechanics was by far the most fun thing about this game, at least for me.With new levels come more mechanics, more and more toys to play with. And because the mechanics are literally words that you see on screen at all times, they are always easy to understand and remember.The inclusion of the undo button makes any minor mistake instantly fixable, which meant that something that would frustrate me in other puzzle games is completely solved.If there was one thing I could really complain about, it would be the graphics. I do not like how the game looks. Does that change my opinion on the game? Not one bit. The graphics being good would have been a bonus."
5169,2601,"Baba is You is a the personification of a meta game. You change rules to be able to solve puzzles, but as you progress through the game, you will transcend the definition of a level and fall down a rabbit hole where all the meaning of the world dissolves as you learn more and more ways to manipulate things you once thought were core mechanics innate to the world.At first, you will stumble blindly, trying to make sense of what you see. You experiment, you make mistakes, you're forced to take a step back (with the handy undo function) and rethink your solution. But the pieces gradually fall into place as you figure out the trick, and armed with the new knowledge, you can solve the puzzle. But as you gain mastery over the game's mechanics, you will manipulate not just pushable blocks, but concepts, core mechanics of the game, and at the end, you will push around entire levels to your liking as just a simple step in solving an even greater mystery. (That's not just me being poetic, that's an actual thing you do later on in the game.)You will learn to appreciate the beauty of a puzzle solution in a way that somebody that has not gone through the same acute pain and riveting revelations can never understand. You will learn to open your mind in a way that is essentially zen meditation. You will learn to see all things as the meaningless empty vessels they are, think about how to fill them with meaning, and use them to achieve your goals. And you will emerge on the other side as a better person, albeit with a melted brain."
5170,2601,"This game is just hilarious!!! It's surprising that this kind of a game was released so late, but fortunately it's here. Big kudos to the creator!!!"
5171,2601,Possibly the hardest game I've played. Super creative. Worth a play if you wanna feel really dumb a lot and then really really smart like once every four hours
5172,2601,much gooded
5173,2601,Game is good
5174,2601,"This is a great puzzle game that you can play whenever you feel bored. Most levels are difficult enough to make you think about what to do for at least 5-10 minutes, and the harder ones I haven't even finished yet10\10"
5175,2601,"yes, but you need a major in astronomy, psychology, and rocket science to get past LEVEL FOUR"
5176,2601,"Probably the most interesting and challenging puzzle game I've played. It's literally about modifying the rules to create a solution to a problem, it has a lot of mechanics and possibilities.However, I was quite disappointed that in a lot of levels, multiple solutions would have been possible but the developers created rules to make all of them invalid except for the one that they expect. It would have been more interesting, in my opinion, to let multiple solutions be possible, which gives more freedom and creativity to the user while keeping high challenges."
5177,2601,This is the best puzzle game I've ever played. It's insanely clever and incredibly rewarding.
5178,2601,puzzle  very cool
5179,2601,good
5180,2601,"Baba is You is one of the most brilliant puzzle games that I have ever played, and I don't mean that lightly. The game does so much with so little in that it seems simple but actually becomes incredibly complex. It's a game that challenges what you are used to by having you alter the most basic rules of gameplay to your convenience. The game has many concepts in the form of words, many of which are incredibly unique in what they do. The game adapts a showing-rather-than-telling mentality in its tutorials, allowing for experimentation instead of explanation, which is excellent for a game like this. Not only are the mechanics interesting, but they also work quite well with other mechanics. These words never get stale. As soon as a word seems to run out of potential, the game combines it with various other words, which greatly increases the potential for these concepts. Every word has an abundance of potential, and with a few unfortunate exceptions, all of these reach their full potential, or at least a higher potential than I would have come up with. It's possible that there are even more secrets to these words that are not apparent from the main game. Each area of the game introduces new words before expanding upon them, as previously mentioned. However, the words are not the only creative part of the game. The level designs are extremely unique. No two levels feel the same. They all have extremely different solutions and ideas to test. That includes some levels that look incredibly similar. There are some bonus levels that look almost exactly like regular levels except for one change. That one change drastically changes the solution into something brand-new. I never knew what I was going to face next. The game gets even more insane in the final areas (I'm not giving any spoilers for that greatness, but you'll know it when you see it). In terms of difficulty, the difficulty curve is amazing. The game starts out very easy, giving you time to learn the mechanics, but within a few areas, you will likely start to struggle. The game ends with some of the hardest puzzles that I have seen in a while (and I'm a big puzzle game fan). There are also plenty of challenging optional puzzles in the early areas to keep you entertained/thinking until it really gets hard. As for the cost, this game is incredibly worthwhile. 100%ing this game took me about 50 hours to complete all 226 levels (at the time of me writing this recommendation). This game is only worth $15, which is absolutely a steal. If you are a puzzle game fan, this game is a must play. It is very challenging, and the creativity is abundant. I would say that the only thing that this game is missing is a level editor, but the creator is currently working on that (at the time of this comment)."
5181,2601,Baba Is BestInLibraryIsWin
5182,2601,"Game Is What?Imagine a Sokoban-style game that involves pushing blocks around and whatnot just like all the other Sokoban-style games. Now, imagine that the game's rules are written on some of those blocks. Imagine what you could achieve if you moved those words around and rewrote the rules. And imagine everything you could make possible...... or, you could play Baba Is You and experience it instead of just imagining it.Design Is CleverThere are two key things you need to get right when making a puzzle game:1. Come up with interesting game mechanics2. Design levels that make great use of said game mechanicsThankfully, this particular game is one that fulfils both of these with flying colours. It's one thing to be able to manipulate the rules of a game, but it's another to present the player with such clever and crafty level design that requires hardcore outside-the-box thinking. The overall concept may sound simple enough, but the ways in which the levels use the game's mechanics so creatively are what make the entire experience truly incredible.Now, I refuse to give spoilers in this review because I don't want to ruin the experience for those of you who haven't played this game yet, but one thing I will say is to expect the unexpected. There's more to this game than meets the eye. Everything's not what it seems. You get the idea. This is honestly the first puzzle game that has ever made me feel a real sense of exploration and excitement, as though I am ""entering the unknown"" and discovering things I'm probably never supposed to know. Parts of the game will leave you shocked and astounded. You will be confused, and believe me, you will enjoy this confusion immensely.Presentation Is LovelyIn addition to being a fun, exciting and rewarding game to play, Baba Is You is also beautifully presented. All the graphics have a playful wiggly outline thing going on (Ed, Edd 'n Eddy, anyone?) and, despite the art style being very minimalist, I find the sprites really cute! I mean, who in their right mind wouldn't want to hug Baba? The typography is also of a consistent style that compliments the art and animation perfectly, and the typeface is clear and easy to read. Which is especially important for a game that revolves around making and breaking the rules.A simple yet absolutely charming soundtrack and suitable in-game sound effects go hand-in-hand with the game's visual aesthetics. I actually find the music quite calming. This is one of the few puzzle games I've played (right before going to bed, I might add) that hasn't lost me any sleep, which is surprising because there were times where I was stuck on a level for days. But this game never left me feeling anxious either. Confused, yes, but not anxious. Perhaps the sweet graphics and chilled music played a factor in this?Game Is RecommendedI am so passionate about Baba Is You that I just want everyone to play it and experience it for themselves! As I already said, there are no spoilers in this review, but for that reason I can't rave about it as much as I want to either. So play it, see for yourself what I'm all hyped about, and let's chat. It's that kind of game.My personal favourite game of 2019!"
5183,2600,"GAME IS YOUBaba Is You is one of the best puzzle games I ever played. The idea seems simple, you need to win each level. But the trick is, you can change the rules. The meaning of winning the game can change. Everything can change.Game design is superb here. Often solution seems easy, but there is a little trick in the end that gets in the way. So you have to come up with other more creative solution. And most of the time, there is more than one solution for each puzzle. Usual tutorial is absent here, game mechanics are explained through gameplay and experimentation. Trying things out is another fun aspect of it. I was 70 hours in, and the game kept blowing my mind with it's ideas. And just as you think you got it all, it throws something different at you, and you have to improvise. Soon it will get official level editor. BABA IS MOREI learned from this game that there is always a solution, no matter how hopeless the situation might seem at first. We like making up rules that do not work as intended sometimes, and questioning them is as important as accepting them. Changing your worldview might be the difference for you between surviving and living, achieving goals and just existing. GAME IS WIN"
5184,2600,"It's cute.You will feel just. So. Stupid. In the face of some of the puzzles this one throws at you. Each level is brilliant, devious, maddening, and each one also usually teaches you a different clever trick about how to manipulate word combinations or world objects.Put your sudoku work book away, THIS is how you get to Big Brain Time.Despite this seemingly severe appraisal, I really love this game. The spritework is cute. The music is simple, pleasant, and unobtrusive, a perfect tempo for your brain to grind its gears so while you ponder. The game's options are pretty comprehensive- want the world to stop wiggling? Checkbox for that. Want it to stop its animations too? Checkbox. Fullscreen? Ye. Windowed fullscreen? Ye. Music? Begone. Warning menu for restarting a level? Up to you!The game world moves in ticks and only ticks when you move or take a wait action, so you can sit there and stare dumbly at the puzzle before for as long as you'd like. If you've pushed a block or object somewhere you don't want it to be, there's an undo button that rolls you back a tick every time you press it, all the way to the very start of the level. Instead of mistakes requiring restarts, it asks you to do little rollbacks instead, and so the time to fix things is literally in seconds. Your inputs are in four directions, to wait a turn, and to undo. That's the entirety of the controls of the game (well, and the restart button, but), and there is a massive, maddening collection of truly brilliant puzzles built on that.It boots up quick, every puzzle is self-contained, there's no time constraint, and the fundamentals of the game are all simple enough that you can pick it up and put it down literally any time you want. Ten minutes to pluck at a puzzle before work? Got it. Leave it on in the background while you muse over it while preparing dinner? You can do that. Gotta step away to feed Baby? The world wiggles on, but waits right there for you. Haven't played in three months? Right there where you left it, and everything is familiar again.And that's it, really. Six buttons, a little over two hundred puzzles, a bunch of wiggly sprites, and some words to push around. It's brilliant at every step.Full recommendation. Buy it full price. Game is Hot, Brain is Melt."
5185,2600,Baba is You > Baba is Good > you stopped existing.
5186,2600,It hurts my head in the best way.
5187,2600,"Best puzzle game ever. No two levels are the same, and there's 200 of them! Many seem impossible at first, yet the solution is always logical. Amazing how many completely different strategies you need to come up with. Every time you think you've seen it all, the next level surprises you yet again. If you love breaking rules, this game is definitely for you."
5188,2600,baba has become meI am one with babaI shall spread baba to the world
5189,2600,"Mechanically unique. If you like puzzle games in general, there is no reason to *not* buy this game at least to try it out.I feel like some of the levels get a bit too complex with a dozen of objects to move around, but that's just a subjective problem. Many of the smaller levels with only a few (4-5) objects are almost as difficult, but I really like how these minimal puzzles can get really difficult with only a couple of moving parts.It does get repetitive at times. Personally I like to play this in small doses, a few levels now and a few more levels tomorrow.As for the amount of content: there's a lot of levels to play through (176). You can also skip about half of the levels and still progress forward to new levels, so it's unlikely that you'll get completely stuck.4/5 would buy again."
5190,2600,Wonderful concept with a good level design. The late game levels might be a bit tedious though
5191,2600,Simple but playful
5192,2600,"Game is great. No seriously, it's fun. There's one level that seems logically impossible at the moment though..."
5193,2600,"The puzzles are clever while remaining quite logical.  It looks like a really simple game, but it very quickly becomes quite challenging.  Many puzzles require a shift in perception to succeed."
5194,2600,Changing the rules is surprisingly fun.
5195,2600,"Baba Is You is a fun, unique and clever puzzle game. Most puzzle games are very simple and straightforward or revolve around spacial reasoning (worst yet there are puzzle games with arbitrary reasoning and poorly crafted hints). Baba Is You is different and does a heck of a job at testing your cleverness. Be forewarned though a good portion of the game is testing what sentences you can form and what effects they have. Sometimes through this testing the solution will pop out."
5196,2600,"BABA is YOU is FUN and EXCITING. PUZZLE is CHALLENGE and BRAIN is MELT not PAIN. START is SIMPLE. NOT START is HARD. ME is not BEAT but has PLAN and DETERMINATION. WALKTHROUGH is DEFEAT and ME is DUMB and has STUPID and has WALKTHROUGH but only sometimes I can't give a good description of the game like this.It's a good time, if not for the occasional level that's extremely hard and requires some serious out-of-the-box thinking or sheer brute-forcing through trial and error in order to solve. Solving harder challenges is super satisfying, though, and even though I'm probably only halfway through the game I've heard that things get pretty crazy later on and I'm exciting to see just how deep the rabbit hole of rule-shaping and breaking goes."
5197,2600,Clever game with a cute style.
5198,2600,"I bought this game expecting (as a computer science major) a relatively simple challenge. What I received was a simple in concept, yet deceptively difficult puzzle game. And honestly? I'm loving every second of it. For reference, I've spent most of my hours in FPS titles for most of my current life. I'm about 90 or so puzzles in, and I have to say, not only is it one of the most refreshing games I've played - it is quite possibly one of the best games I'll ever play, puzzle or otherwise. Let me explain. I have more hours than currently listed on my profile for this game, as I'll find myself staring (essentially idling) at the screen, sometimes with a friend or two watching and throwing out ideas. It's a game that requires you to experiment and tinker with your board state, and ultimately rewards you for doing so. Fixing a mistake is as simple as undoing or restarting, and thankfully, the game doesn't punish you for it.No other game has given me as much a rush of exhilaration as this one. Solving a puzzle that you've spent a bit of time on is incredibly gratifying. They may take time - sometimes more time than you'd expect. You might have to take breaks and come back to it later. Sometimes, you'll have to bounce around puzzles to understand how one mechanic might help you somewhere else. That moment of clarity that you get after clearing a puzzle is, without a doubt, one of the best experiences you'll have playing this game, but I'd argue that the journey before getting there is where this game truly shines. It's difficult without a doubt, but using a guide to play this game rids yourself of these moments. It's not it makes you a ""bad"" gamer - you just lose out on having these moments, which ruins, I think, the entire purpose of this game. It's going to require some testing and a large amount of lateral thinking. If you're even thinking about buying this game, don't rob yourself of the journey by watching someone else play through the game or by reading a hint guide.Not every puzzle has to be completed in order to win the game. And yet, I've never felt more compelled to go beyond what the game requires. Never mind the money you'd spend to play this game - Baba is You is absolutely worth your time and effort.Tl;dr: Read my review, and then buy this game."
5199,2600,One of the best puzzle game in the world !
5200,2600,Baba is you is win
5201,2600,"Countless hours of joy. If I get stuck, I usually figure it out while lying in bed.Very satisfying solutions."
5202,2600,This game can be brutally hard but worth every second
5203,2600,This is simultaneously the most insane and most logically consistent puzzle game I've ever played.A+++
5204,2600,"If you like breaking the rules, breaking reality, silly interactions, and mind-numbingly confusing puzzles, this is absolutely the game for you. If you don't like thinking or goofy mechanics, you're SOL. If you like puzzle games in any capacity Baba Is You is a highly recommended purchase for me. Game Devs deserve it, and 10% of the Lead Dev's income goes directly to charity."
5205,2600,"Very inventive and creative with its puzzles. It gets very difficult at times, and often mind-bending, but you feel like a genius when you get the concept behind a puzzle."
5206,2600,"Very creative ideas and level solutions, but it can be very difficult at times,"
5207,2600,Brilliant original puzzle game. Best hacking game on steam because It actually teaches you to think outside the box.
5208,2600,Soooo great. Tiny and beautiful.Just hope I can get a phone version so I don't have to spend my time before computer all day to work out the puzzles.

5217,2600,"Certainly the most unique puzzle game I've ever played, Baba Is You is a blast! Puzzles range from incredibly easy to mind-destroyingly hard."
5218,2600,Brain is hurt
5219,2600,"Baba is you is a puzzle game that is hard by design. to explain, Baba at its core is difficult but cannot be tweaked or changed without making it not Baba. this makes Baba extremely unique as some puzzles will sometimes take hours to complete. baba also has a smooth linear progression in puzzle difficulty, which slowly introduces players to new mechanics while finding new quirks about old ones. for example, baba is you and baba is move makes you move 2 spaces and unable to go through some hallways in a conventional way. another way baba is difficult is not finding the solution, but all of the 'not solutions'. you will more than likely try something in a level and have it not work, allowing you to indirectly progress through said level, albeit very slowly. baba is also meta-physical, so the game encourages you to try things that logically shouldn't work, but ends up working anyways. this often times leads to the solution to a level.to summarize, baba is the greatest puzzle game of the decade. and I can say that statement with confidence.Review is Done."
5220,2600,"These puzzles are frustrating and make my head hurt, but every time you solve one you feel so good."
5221,2600,"This game is really creative. It seems to start out simple, but you'll still be like ""damn I'm glad I can manipulate the level like that"". A lot of levels have multiple ways to win, and hilarious ways to interact with it. The later levels get really difficult, but it makes it all the more fun to solve them. Sometimes you'll stare at it for a long time until it just clicks as to what you need to do.This is one of the most creative games I have played, and I can *easily* recommend it for anyone"
5222,2600,"GAME is AMAZINGSeriously though, this game has so much inginuity and originality ! If it weren't for game developing, I think the devs of this game could single-handedly save this planet and transcend our species to the next level. Too bad we're just stuck with an amazing game. That said, I've been on and off of it since it is so hard, but you can't ever get stuck in the way that you can't do anything. If you can't do a level there'll be tens of others that unlock even more of them.To end it all off, I'd like to quote the video review that convinced me into buying this game:""You want out of the box ? In this game you ARE the box"" - and that can't be more on point"
5223,2600,"This is probably the most innovative, inventive, and creative game I've played in ten years."
5224,2600,"A superb puzzle game. The rules are written in tiles that can be pushed around, allowing you to reorganize them. The puzzles are small, compact and just the right amount of challenging to require out of box thinking and to really wring your brain cells without becoming long-time blockers."
5225,2600,"This is my Game of the Year choice so far for 2019. It's the most unique puzzle game I've ever played. I was interested in the early game by the unique game mechanics and interactions. By midgame I was impressed to see that each new level was still fresh, and the creator didn't seem to run out of ideas. By the late game I was amazed at what the game did with the concept. A lot of puzzle games wear out their welcome, but Baba is You saved the best for last. This game is worth sticking out until the end, and it's worth staying unspoiled and experiencing it for yourself. There's nothing quite like feeling you've exhausted every possible option on a level, and getting that moment of realization. I learnt a lot of how blind my brain is to some solutions, and the game can make you feel like a genius and an idiot. If you get really stuck, you can find a hint guide ""Baba is Hint"", which gives gentle nudges in the right direction without giving the direct solution.."
5226,2600,epic game.

I've finally completed this gem and I'm now waiting for the official level editor to be finished and integrated in the game so I can easily play some custom levels.Just play this game. And don't give up. I've stared at a level for hours without being able to solve them, only to come back a week later and suddenly solving it in less than 5 minutes."

5238,2600,baba good
5239,2600,"The best puzzle game I have ever played. The mechanic of moving text blocks to change game rules is very simple but so powerful it sustains hundreds of stimulating, creative applications. If you are dedicated you'll also see the rule breaking get meta in very fun ways."
5240,2600,Most hard and original puzzle game played so far. To complete a level you must try to make sentences that breaks levels rules.
5241,2600,level editor very cool
5242,2600,"A puzzle game hasn't fried my brain this hard since The Witness, jesus"
5243,2600,"Super good game. Some of the puzzles are really difficult and the solutions require thinking in a different way, which is very satisfying once you get it."
5244,2600,prop is stupid and game is hard
5245,2600,"This is a tepid thumbs up.  I really do love this game, but I do not love many of the levels.  Too many of them rely on you having to guess which rule happens first when two things occur simultaneously (i.e. in a single move).  If this were laid out in the rules, or better yet, if this weren't such a focus of the gameplay, it'd be much less frustrating."
5246,2600,its a great game i guess
5247,2600,what a cute game also im stuck in this hell forever
5248,2600,"Difficult but solvable puzzles. The core concept is ingenious, but after more than 200 levels understandably not that mind-blowing anymore. Still enjoyed the whole game. Baba is cute. Keke has personality. Game is win."
5249,2600,Love this game more than I can express in i review i set no time aside for. really difficult 8/10
5250,2599,One of the best puzzle games I have ever played. There is an incredible amount of cleverness put into the levels and figuring out some of the trickier ones is incredibly satisfying. Highly recommended.
5251,2599,Yes.
5252,2599,"You start a new puzzle. You spend a couple minutes taking it in. You think to yourself, ""this seems impossible."" Twenty minutes later, you've solved it. Repeat x100."
5253,2599,"Deep, challenging. Worth playing."
5254,2599,This very well may be the greatest and most challenging puzzle game I've ever played. I just finished the final level after months of staring at the screen trying to figure out what to do. Don't be afraid to take a break. I had to look up a few hints to make sure I was on the right track. It's insane and I love it.
5255,2599,this game is fantastic

5260,2599,"I think I'm too stupid to play this game, but when I get it right it feels really good."
5261,2599,"This game is a semi-difficult puzzle game that forces you to think out of the box quite often.The puzzles get really hard, but when you get them there's extreme satisfaction that makes you keep coming back for more."

5264,2599,"This game is awesome. Easy to get into, and actually HARD"
5265,2599,"Hands down the most unique, meta, fun, difficult, and best puzzle games I've played in years. Highly HIGHLY recommend."

5267,2599,This game just restored my faith in puzzle games.
5268,2599,a wonderful and truly unique puzzle game
5269,2599,The concept of changing the rules is brilliant and it makes my brain hurt a lot more than anything else.
5270,2599,GAME is GOOD
5271,2599,Truly a masterpiece of a puzzle game. The idea behind it is innovative and something I've never seen. The mechanics of each puzzle are pretty much the same but different combinations of starting comibations allow them to be completly different. One of very few games where I had to stop and actually think about what I even had to do and only then how to do it and not just brute-force the solution by trail and error.I highly recommend it!
5272,2599,baba is you!baba is good
5273,2599,"This is one of the greatest games I have ever played. Its so simple, but at the same time fun and challenging. I am, because i still havent finished, loving this game, and, honestly, even knowing that the game is really recent, I think making a second game for it would be extraordinary, so just have this in mind ;) Thanks for crating such a good, challenging and well-made puzzle game!EDIT: Finished the game a while ago, but had to comment again on how good this is.Plus, Im recommending the game on steam award ;) You deserve this!"
5274,2599,"In a lot of logical games you are asked to ""think outside the box"". Well, Baba Is You never allows you to do anything unless you are outside of the box, which is very taxing on your brain, but solutions are always satisfying to discover.The game mechanics is fresh, the design is simplistic and fun, Baba Is You is a hidden gem.The game is quite hard though, so I wouldn't recommend it if you look for something casual."
5275,2599,Pretty good but my pea brain can't handle it.
5276,2599,Really fun puzzle game.
5277,2599,"I love this game so much. Its beautiful and really easy on the eye and mind to look at, super relaxing. Except for the puzzles, they are crazy hard.The levels lead you into it though, teaching you along the way, and the set up gives you little clues. I love this developer I wish everyone put this much love into their games."
5278,2598,Very good puzzle/riddle game. Riddles can be pretty difficult and challenging.
5279,2598,GAME IS GOOD
5280,2598,"The best puzzle game since Portal 2, and my game of the year-cute graphics-genius puzzle design-Many hour of content for $15"
5281,2598,BABA IS BEST PUZZLE
5282,2598,i love it so far
5283,2598,Baba is refund.One trick pony. Should be a free browser game or something.
5284,2598,This game is deceptively simple and punishingly difficult. The cleverness of level design is outstanding.
5285,2598,"Baba is you is an achievement of a game.  The concept is so unique (and adorable) but is so fleshed out and so creatively integrated that 100%ing this game is a one of a kind experience.  Rarely do I consider games a masterpiece, but Baba is You is a masterpiece."
5286,2598,"Don't let the appearance fool you. Behind its simple, almost childlike pixel-art graphics, Baba is You is one of the most devious, mind-bending puzzle games I've ever played. It's also brilliantly tutorialized, with implicit, well-thought-out, distributed tutorials which force you to not just learn but thoroughly master each new concept before the game introduces another. In terms of the mechanics and the puzzles created with them, I'd consider Baba is You to be the equal of the Portal games and that is not praise I offer lightly. It is rather lacking in some other areas because the central mechanic (clever and well-explored though it is) makes it nearly impossible to tell any kind of coherent story. Also, the only concession to making the game less frustrating is that you can skip a ton of levels and still progress.Still though, Baba is You is an excellent game to spend a few days on, and I'd heavily recommend it especially for anyone with an interest in game design."
5287,2598,BIG BRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIN
5288,2597,"Baba is You is the best puzzle game I have ever played. Most puzzle games introduce concepts and then ""build"" on those concepts by forcing you to do bigger and bigger ""order of events"" puzzles. Where there are few ""ah-ha"" moments, and more trial-and-error until you discover the right combination of tricks. Baba is You introduces simple concepts, and the puzzles are small, but far from easy. Solutions are elegant and rewarding, and most puzzles have a unique twist where each discovery is seriously satisfying. Highly recommended"
5289,2597,"This game feels as if I'm learning a new language through ""immersion"".   Step 1: Curious - I love learning new languages!  Step 2: Frustrated - I feel stupid, I should be able to understand this new language!  Step 3: Angry - this language is stupid, not me!  Step 4: Intrigued - maybe this new language does make a sort of sense.  Step 5: I listen to others around me who are also struggling to learn (I watch ""guides"" and ""walkthroughs"").  Step 6: I realized that there are multiple ways to interpret a concept (pass a level) -- just as with most actual languages!  Step 7: For a few moments a day I find myself thinking in the new language -- like a native speaker.P.S.  I'm running ""Baba Is You"" on an Apple Mac machine  recently upgraded  to the Catalina 64-bit operating system, and so far i've found no problems"
5290,2597,"I do not like puzzle games. I abhor them. I dislike them out of a combination of not finding them stimulating enough, and/or find the difficulty and level of thinking to be absolutely beyond my capabilities and too foreign to learn. Baba Is You Is Charming. So charming, that I would sit down at a puzzle, try a few combinations, get frustrated and power down--- then return at some point later within the next day or two to work at a puzzle a little more. I would accumulate minutes to hours on certain puzzles, even talk to friends about my metaphysical problems, and through writing and talking out my thoughts, I learned that it was easier for me to figure out solutions.The game is just so cozy with its strange theme, with really nice sound design and music to keep you vibing with your thought process and not feeling pressure. I'm still ass at this game and I love it."

5292,2597,"Very hard game, and yes. You will use your brain, alot! I Promise you that. 10 out of 10."
5293,2597,Great puzzle game! Very relaxing and intellectually stimulating. (:
5294,2597,84 / 100
5295,2596,Great puzzle game and have enjoyed every second of it.Also would like the developer to know somebody has ripped this game into the iOS App Store and is getting ad revenue from your game while spelling it for free. So you may want to take action against that.
5296,2596,"I just solved a puzzle by making a Key that is Push and Open into a Shut, which made the Key to open itself. And then I turned into a Door which allowed me to touch a Flag that is Win.  I haven't gotten very far into the game yet but it has already turned out to be a really fun and creative puzzle game.  Update: So I have now played over 15 hours and completed around 100 puzzles and the game is still fun and entertaining is it definitely has been worth the money even if it becomes boring (I believe there are around 220 puzzles in total). The game can also be quite tricky and I must admit that on few occasions I have been resorted to using hints."
5297,2596,Yes. A thousand times yes. This game blew my mind all the way through.
5298,2596,brain is meltgame is hot
5299,2596,"[I haven't finished the game but I still had some overall positive thoughts to share. If you'd like to watch some gameplay and listen to an audio reading of this, follow this Youtube link: https://youtu.be/P_I78z8MWS0 I shouldnt be surprised that I cant even come close to finishing Baba is You. If its world map is any indication, I got just under halfway through before running into a wall, the likes of which I cant get past without collaborating with others during my livestream or resorting to a guide - The latter however feels like a last resort in puzzle games. Its to no fault of the game as it functions, gives you all the necessary information up front, is simple to control and introduces new rules at a healthy rate which only opens up new possibilities and obstacles which can be bonkers to overcome later on. If anything the fault lies within my silly self not being able to wrap my head around being Baba.Word Conjunctions and Statements: The Game wouldnt be that far off in explaining what Baba is You is all about. Take word blocks and put them together to create rules which then affects entities, objects and the environment. Baba is You means that the titular sheep-looking-thing is controlled by the player. Wall is Stop means that walls are impassable. Skull is Defeat means that bumping into a skull requires rewinding or restarting so on. The game has such easy wording to follow that it doesnt take long to read the level and figure out what each rule means in relation to how to win, but putting the pieces and words together to allow said winning is where things get difficult - When I say putting words together, thats meant literally. Pushing a block allows one to break that rule or to use it elsewhere to form a new one. For example: Wall is Stop can have any of those blocks pushed out of the way which leads to walls no longer being impassable barricades, but pushing Wall into is Win leads to said wall tiles now allowing victory if touched. The early game might sound easy but that doesnt last very long. My first thought about the game was how it uses grade school english and somehow won the hearts of many - Typical cynicism of me which naturally ended up being wrong. I would catch snippets of game developers on social media praising it but was curious as to why the press and other consumers were mostly quiet about it. Well touch on why I think that is later, but in hindsight its clear that people who make games had more to say about it than those who play them for work and hobby. Baba is You has that funny knack for making you feel like the smartest person in the room, but the very opposite is true when stuck on a puzzle and just staring at it in disbelief - With simple words and all the tools available, one just needs to push the right words together, right?Box has Key but Box is Weak, but why not then make Box has Key and Box so that when Box breaks from Weak it spawns a new box but also a key? But Key doesnt have is Push so that when Key appears it cant be pushed into Door since Door is Shut which leads to Flag is Win. Why not make Key is You so that when Key appears you can control Key and to go Door, but using yourself ends up in a fail state since Key is gone but youre no longer Baba and-You can see how things get silly. Dont even get me started when Baba is Baba is introduced.Later levels end up having so many working parts or needing to break the rule logic that once the solution clicks its a wonderful rush of satisfaction - Said clicks take a while to arrive though, and in my case I spent more time scratching my head and humming in thought than racking up solutions. I frequently threw my hands up in exasperation claiming that a level is impossible, only to then have everything make sense once the solution came together.I try to avoid using tropes whenever possible but I have to pull out my this game isnt for me card. A friend of mine on Discord, Maxwell, summed up why that might be pretty conclusively:  It's a game by programmers for programmers. It's a niche that got big for a while, and while this game is far more accessible than most of the field, there's still going to come a moment where a layperson's ability just won't be enough.While unable to contact the developer for clarification, when looking at Baba is You through the eyes of a programmer it makes astronomically more sense as to why later levels become so heavy and thorough with the number of rules to form and break. This also is likely why other developers took more from it than others.I found my brief bouts of solving levels and its ensuing joy being overshadowed by how often I would stare at the screen in stumped frustration. Some people can enjoy being in that situation; figuring out and solving these brain busters and getting gratification out of it - I just end up feeling really dang dumb. To reiterate, Baba is You is far from bad or meriting criticism for being so challenging. Its a puzzle game where the solution is right in front of you, its just a matter of piecing it all together -  I just dont have the cranial capacity for it and still have a good time while doing so. Its a weird position to be in; recommending a game that I cant complete to save my life without resorting to a guide, but here we are. Baba is You is rotten for having so many sly, canny moments and ideas that definitely merits a buy, though under the caveat to know what youre in for."

5307,2596,GAME IS BUY
5308,2596,"When Jonathan Blow says ""mind expending games"", no doubt he means something like Baba. This is one of the best puzzle games I've ever played. It breaks any assumption you may have, multiple times.However, it does feel sometimes that not all the levels were thoroughly playtested, because some of the levels require iteration and trying even after you understand the solution, just to overcome ""technical"" issues. This can be annoying.Despite the drawbacks, I fully recommend this game to anyone who loves puzzle games. You will not find many puzzle games that are better than this."
5309,2596,"This game is amazing! The way it lets you slowly figure things out yourself, and the pace at which it adds new elements is close to perfect"
5310,2596,"This is an instant classic. One of the best puzzle / logic games out there. Music is great too. I loved hearing the new track the next world had to offer, and somehow it never got old. If you like puzzle games, do yourself a favour and pick this up. I just wish I was better at it!"

I find the difficulty fair, being that it is possible to derive the solution without trial and error most of the time. That said, not everyone appreciates such endeavours. The levels are frustrating to solve and only those of us who can see pass the suffering can appreciate the game as it is -- a well-crafted puzzle-solving gem.There is a vibrant community out there creating level packs that cater to a wide audience. If you have purchased the game and find the main game unpalatable due to the difficulty, there are packs that aim to demonstrate the possibilities of the game while keeping the puzzles accessible. From what I read around here, this should appeal to those of us who regrettably give this game a negative review. There are also crazily hard level packs that challenge even those who complete the main game by themselves.Keep on enjoying the game!"

5326,2594,"A clever and deep thinking game that plays with your ideas of how reality should be seen, using simple statements to make things equally more and less complicated. A charming little number with characters such as the titular BABA, their friend KEKE, and of course, good ol' ME, with crazy things happening from multiplying BABA to changing objects into other objects, there is no end to the creativity that must be employed in order to solve these treacherous and mind-bending puzzles. And some of these are complicated enough to warrant looking up a walkthrough, which there is a useful one that has a DIY solving system where you can learn a few steps in the process and figure the rest out on your own.So go in there and make sure that the YOU block is at least someone!"
5327,2594,heck
5328,2594,"It's a puzzle game. The puzzles are sorta MacGyver-ish, in the sense of realizing that you can use a ladder as a breathing tube. If you have trouble with creative problem solving you might get stuck but that's not really the fault of the game, it's the genre.Unique, lots of puzzles. I can't think of any real downsides."
5329,2594,game is hard
5330,2594,Extremely creative puzzle game. Can get very challenging at times and it requires you to really use your creativity. It's quite a mind bending and fun game.
5331,2593,Simple and lot of fun!
5332,2593,"I love the mechanics of this game, 100% original idea.I'm not recommending BABA is YOU because i feel like most puzzle games teach you how to play pretty well. Whereas this game has an insanely hard difficulty ramp. Even when looking up solutions to puzzles i typically still dont understand them :/"
5333,2593,GAME IS GOOD
5334,2593,"One of the hardest but rewarding games i have played in a while. It requires you to actually think, and some puzzles can be quite easy, mind you still not ""easy"" in a normal sense, and then there are ""those"" puzzles. Like, what the hell am i supposed to do? And then you give up, search for the answer online and its so simple. I think I bought this for like 5 dollars, worth the pain to me."
5335,2593,"Baba Is You may very well be the perfect puzzle game. It is definitely one of the best puzzle games I have ever played, if not the best.The reason BIY is so good is that it is purely a game about logic, eliminating any randomness, trial&error and other similar problems many puzzlers have. The main gameplay consists of moving around the tiles that make up the rules of the level. For example, forming ""Rock Is Push"" means you can push rocks in the level; removing ""Push"" from this equation by moving that tile away means rocks cant be pushed anymore. It is as simple as the art style, but it forms some really mind-bending puzzles: a total of 226, in fact, if you do all of them. The rules never change, but what you do with them defines how you solve puzzles - which is probably the best approach for puzzle games.BIY also makes me happy because I am actually able to say ""Wow, I am just too dumb for this level lol"" instead of blaming the game for it. Its a game I had absolutely no shame looking up (many) solutions for, since there was no way I wouldve been able to finish the game 100 % otherwise. Its both simple and amazingly complex, and it may very well be the perfect puzzle game (with a simple and clean soundtrack to boot). If you love to challenge yourself and find your limits, or if you love any sort of puzzler, just get this as soon as you can.Personal Rating: 10/10."

No creativity allowedImagine a game like Portal being updated like thatLots of inconsistency between puzzles, even if rules are the same.Sometimes text destroys itself in water, sometimes it doesn't.  Objects without attributes can occupy the same space just fine but can't have floating text overhead?When rocks float you can't interact with them, when text floats, can push them around just fine.  Just the whole ""float"" mechanic in generalNo tutorial or even a list of what the different words mean.  Usually worth looking at a wiki when a word is encountered for the first time.  (Melt?

5363,2592,"Incredibly charming puzzler, adorable characters and an awesome soundtrack. This game consistently surprised us with solutions and any levels that were too difficult were usually because we focused too hard on one particular mechanic being the right way to go about things (I'm looking at you Deep Forest-12). Often times I even caught my mind drifitng during the day trying to think of solutions to the puzzle that had stumped us the night before. The puzzles were engaging and entertaining for the entire 60 hours it took 100% the game and I was legitmately sad when Baba was done.Any DLC would be an instant buy for me."
5364,2592,"I love puzzle games and I love the brilliant mechanics and puzzle design in this one.But holy crap this is hard. Usually it takes a few levels for me to ""get"" a puzzle mechanic and then the puzzles become a bit easier, but somehow almost every single level in this one manages to break my brain anew."
5365,2592,"I have a feeling this game will last me for awhile. I love puzzle games, especially ones where you have to figure out the mechanics and rules by yourself through trial and error. I bought this on sale, but I would have definitely been happy paying full price for this game."

5369,2591,its a pretty well designed game and stuff but i ended up not liking it and refunding it
5370,2591,Gud.
5371,2591,"Genuinely one of the greatest puzzle games I have ever played. It makes you think outside of the box, rewrite logic, and not play by the rules. Some levels even try to trick you into a setup that is false, and discovering this deception is an excellent discovery of your own wit. It is also very meta without being dependent on irony or 4th wall (Undertale)."
5372,2591,"One of the most unique and captivating puzzle games I've ever played. The cute aesthetic and promise of cool puzzles drew me in and the massive depth of the game kept me hooked.Bear in mind this game gets HARD. There some very hard levels early on, but the difficulty begins ramping up around World 4 and some of the late-game levels are mind-boggling.With over 200 levels, there's easily enough content to keep you occupied for 40-50 hours (provided you don't use hints or look up solutions like I did for some of the extremely hard ones - I'm not *that* clever ok :( ).There's work being done on an official level editor (and an unofficial one already released) so there's more content on the way. If you enjoy games like the Zachtronics games, you probably have the right kind of brain to love this game. Although, even if you've never touched code or anything computer science related in your life, this game is simple enough to learn that you'll have no problem getting hooked too."
5373,2591,best game this world's ever  seen
5374,2591,I wonder if this game is available in IOS App Store because I saw a FREE version of this game in IOS App Store.  I think maybe someone copied the developer's work. Does anyone know the contact information of the game developer? The developer should be told about this!!!   iOS App Store(` )
5375,2591,"A really fun puzzle game with a very nice and unique design/style. Honestly, a great game overall in all aspects. Have definitely recommended to all of my friends, gamers and non-gamers alike."
5376,2591,Amazing idea for a game. The levels are brilliant. Buy it.

I have not played a logic/puzzle game this good since Antichamber.Everything in this game is godly.The soundtrack is amazing, the gameplay is authentic, the puzzles are challenging and fun at the same time.The more you keep on playing the more your mind will be blown by things you never realized were possible.I suggest you to pay for this game even if you got a pirated version.We need more games like this.Edit(28/11/2019): If you own Baba Is You and you didn't vote it for Game of the year 2019 just delete your steam account and stop playing games because you have a terrible game taste."
5381,2591,Game Is Good.
5382,2590,"Clever idea, but doesn't really keep you interested and so has very limited longevity. Inexpensive, but really more of an advanced phone app. Nothing wrong with it, but nothing to write home about either. Average."
5383,2590,Baba is HardBrain is DeadRecommend is Yes
5384,2590,Very clever idea. Well executed.
5385,2590,"The puzzles are as good as any from The Talos Principle and The Witness. They can't be brute-forced, you need that aha! moment. Wonderful game, and worked splendidly on my 2GB RAM windows tablet (though no touch interface, you need a controller)"
5386,2590,"This is easily one of the best puzzle games ever made. The sokoban and rule halves of the game are completely balanced, the rules work intuitively, and there's a really good difficulty curve. What I think sets this apart from most puzzle games I've played is just how hard Baba pushes its framework. I can barely see any room for fan levels when the game provides such absurd late-game levels. The ending parts of this game are magical."
5387,2590,Great think-out-of-the-box puzzle game.  Very charming.
5388,2590,"Great game, puzzles are easy at first but soon get complex. and the music is really good"
5389,2590,"I'm not finished with this game but the hours I put into this game was definitely quality time. I mean, yeah, I'm sometimes just staring at the screen and thinking ""can you even solve this?"" but in the end I find a solution.At first I just though ""yeah the idea is nice, I've played something that reminds me of this, it's probably fun"" but I never expected the game to melt my brain like that. The level design is super good. The funny thing is, it just says what's happening, baba is you, flag is win and the likes. Sometimes it still melts my brain with the weird things going on... it makes perfectly sense but with each new area new rules are added and it gets really wild.The music is okay, it's really relaxing. I am playing this game sometimes solo and sometimes with my flat mates over steam link, chilling and puzzling - that goes really well and we're having a good time here.I don't regret buying this a bit, if you like puzzles, go ahead and get the game. Also a few bucks go to charity. This game got good reviews for a reason and I'll definitely keep an eye on the dev."
5390,2589,I bought a 1070ti just to play this game
5391,2589,"One of the best puzzle games I've ever played. The gameplay is really simple, but the levels get surprisingly more complex as you keep playing. There's tons of ways to interact with the levels and the game always rewards your lateral thinking. A must-play for anyone who enjoys puzzles."
5392,2589,"Amazing game. So simple, and yet so great. How nobody had that idea before?It is a very good casual game. Really really really worth the money!!!!"
5393,2589,yes
5394,2589,"This is probably the best puzzle game I've ever played. I cannot recommend this game enough to anyone interested in problems that require lateral thinking.Baba is You is a block-pushing game, at least superficially. A classic kind of puzzler with plenty of challenges in its own right. But Baba is You offers a twist on this mechanic that is so all-encompassing that it may as well be its own genre of game, with block-pushing taking the backseat.Every level carries its own rules, typically including ""Baba is You"". So long as those are connected, you control Baba. Perhaps ""Wall is Stop"" will be there as well. So long as they are connected, walls are impassable. The trick is that they don't have to stay connected. Often, you'll be forced to form your own rules in such a way as to make the level beatable or even break rules!It's in this that we find the genius of Baba is You. Puzzles are devilishly simple, but require constant rethinking of how the game's logic works, something unaccustomed to most people. Every level asks you to reconsider how you thought things worked and find ways to make things work in such a way that you can win. The challenge is almost entirely in conception: thinking of what the mind-bending solution is. It's never a trial and error challenge of trying every combination and order, but of figuring out exactly what the challenge really is for that level.Add to this, a pleasant aesthetic with calm music and a charmingly simple gameplay system, Baba is You really has no disappointing aspect for me. Reading the negative reviews, the consensus seems to be that the faults are that the game is underexplained or that interactions are often unpredictable and unclear or that the main mechanic isn't used sufficiently. I can't say that I agree with these faults.Baba is You really doesn't need explaining: any explaining would just diminish what makes it interesting. Every level that has a new text block makes you excited to see what it does, how you can use it and what to make of it. The entire appeal of Baba is You is the slow mastering of every level by experimentation and abstract thinking.Unpredictable and unclear interactions in a game about changing the mechanics of the game seems to be trying to have your cake and eat it to me. I fail to see how a game that is about constantly shaking up how the game works could have ONLY obvious and intuitive interactions. To me, the unclear and unpredictable is part of the fun. You are often cast into the deep end and have to try to think your way out.Finally, not using the main mechanic comes up in some reviews, usually accompanied by saying that later levels often have stationary text that cannot be changed out. While I admit that this can seem superficially disappointing, it's ultimately what leads to actually compelling and interesting puzzles. With some locked rules, Baba is You forces you to play around those limitations which can themselves be changed from level to level. If every level was just about changing the rules of the game and allowing all text to be interacted with, solutions would likely just default to whatever the player last used to beat a level.So in short, I think this is possibly a perfect game and that the criticisms of it that appear here are not really applicable. If that doesn't tell you that I recommend it, let me say this:Baba is YouGame is Great and Buy"

5402,2588,"This game is ever so delightful early on, because the idea of rewriting rules is incredibly fun and engaging.  Especially with the idea of finding unintended solutions.But nonstop they end up changing the solutions for levels via patch every time an unintended solution comes up. It's no longer about being creative, and while solving the set solution is fun for some, it quickly becomes all the game offers, and that quickly becomes saddening.I'm not smart enough to play past a certain point. That's a little sad, but true. I don't want every game to be built around me.  But when the game initially provides so many beautiful variations in solving puzzles, and eventually all that variation goes away, it just kind of gets sad. I really wish that these levels that they patched would instead become 'challenge stages' for the harder variations, instead of removing the chance of finding that ""ahah"" simpler solution and feeling tricky.in the end i still recommend it."

5411,2588,Brain is melt.This game is hard man.
5412,2587,"Right upfront - this is a ""this didn't work for me"" downvote, not a ""this is a crap game"" downvote.There are lots of things to like about Baba is You.I think it's very clever - some of the puzzles are amazing in their creativity and complexity.  The idea is wonderful, and the implementation is perfectly adequate.I should love this game.I was hoping that this would be the kind of charming, quirky puzzler that I could recommend to my mum and we could talk about it.  But as I was playing I realized ... I don't think my mum would enjoy playing this, heck I don't think I'm enjoying playing this.Thinking about this I think it comes down to the (structurally inevitable) style of the puzzles.  They are very very ""programmerly"", which is unsurprising given that it's all about manipulating rules, iterating, testing, thinking about the possible approaches using the available tools and resources, etc.  Again, as a former software engineer this really should be right up my alley.And yet.  The thing that makes a good puzzler game, as others have pointed out, is having that gap between what you know how to do and what you don't (yet) know how to do, and for that gap to seem not insurmountable with enough chipping away and determination.  The puzzles in Baba is You just get so opaque and confounding that it's just ... wearying.  I'm quite happy to accept that I'm just not smart enough at this kind of thinking, but I think there's also a problem with how rewarding it feels to solve these.  There were several instances where taking a break, having a sleep, coming back to a puzzle fresh, did allow me to have a new look at the problem and get to solving the level, but it didn't feel particularly rewarding.  I find myself increasingly reluctant to dive back in knowing I'm going to be bashing my tired brain against seemingly impossible arcane puzzles.I wasn't enjoying launching the game.That's a problem for a game for me."
5413,2587,"I'm happy for everyone who enjoyed the game. I didn't.A good puzzle game has to have balanced difficulty, reasonable learning curve and a sense of accomplishment after you beat a level. Baba has neither. About 15 puzzles in I had to start to regularly check walkthroughs and in the end I often discovered the game just didn't explain its mechanics properly and there was some secret behavior I have no idea about. Many solutions felt like exploiting a glitch more than anything else.Sometimes the game even breaks its own rules: You can SWAP into a STOP wall; there's even an animation of you moving into a square which you should not be able to move in. ""A is B and A is C"" sometimes changes A into both B and C and other times says it's invalid. You can FALL through DEFEAT objects even though they should kill you.  And I still have absolutely no idea how EMPTY tiles work.Although I'm a completionist, I gave up halfway through this game, just couldn't bear it any longer. I'm not sure if I've ever played a game more frustrating than Baba."
5414,2587,"Rules are simple, but The game is hard. ,Estimate difficulty level  :A to A+  ---  (for normal people) B to A-   ---  (for those who study science/maths ) Recommend to those who love to use their mind or test their IQ.IQIf you can finish 30+ locations, you're already good.30, 60 locations, your IQ is surely above average.60 IQDon't feel upset/sham if you can't finish even one area. , .*** Just like real life, some of the problems we're facing have just """"ONE"""" solution and some of the ""rules are hidden"". We need to find our those hidden rules and the unique solution."
5415,2587,"Baba Is You is the most enjoyable puzzle game I have ever played. The core mechanics are interesting and fun without overwhelming you, and the difficulty curve is fairly generous because the game allows you to put off completing a large number of levels if you find them too difficult to solve.There's around 50 hours of content for a die-hard puzzle fanatic, and closer to double that if you're a bit dim like me. The game will teach you lessons about persistence and patience that will flow over into your every day life. If you think exercising your brain is fun, give this game a go."

5428,2586,"With the DROD guys retiring from service, I didn't think Stephen's Sausage Roll or The Witness would get another sequel so soon. As a programmer, I thought this game would be home turf, a logical manipulation of rules with which I am accustomed, but Zachtronics spake ""No, this is not my domain"", and thus I was cast into a pit of dumbitude here. I have to admit to consulting a few no-spoilers hint guides on a few of these and regretting it later because those levels where you spend 45 minutes brainstorming ""There's only like 3 possible paths here, what am I overlooking"" and then you step away from it, let your subconscious ponder it for a few hours and the answer clicks are just jewels you take to your grave. Usually it's a solution that involves powergaming the rules, for lack of a better term - something that entails a risky maneuver which seems dead obvious after the fact. None of the solutions require elaborate and lengthy patterns to solve.It is concise and terse and towards the end a little exploratory. Early puzzles that seemed impossible are obvious when you come back to them, and building your brain muscle like that is a hallmark of a well designed puzzle game. 11/10"
5429,2586,"Simple design and concept, immaculate execution.You know when you ""cheese"" a level in mario maker or another platformer, or perhaps pull off one of the many glitches in other video games?Baba is You is not only about finding that answer, but also then building on top of that, and taking it to a limit so extreme you could have never forseen it in the first place. That feeling of letting the rules click together and getting another damned dandelion is priceless....also it's getting a level editor in spring, literally what are you waiting for?!"

5431,2586,"Short reviewBaba is puzzlePuzzle has rulesRules are wordsPlayer moves wordsRules are changed Puzzle is hardBrain is meltPlayer finds solutionFeelsGood Baba is must buyFull reviewBaba Is You is a puzzle game where the rules of each puzzle are defined by the words you can see in the level, and the player is able to rearrange the words to change the rules. For example, ""[object] is you"" identifies the character you control, and ""[item] is win"" identifies the thing that you need to touch to solve the puzzle. If ""Baba is you"" and ""flag is win"", you control Baba (a white animal, possibly a cat) and you need to touch the flag. But what if Baba and the flag are on opposite sides of a stream, and ""water is sink""? As soon as you touch the water, you'll die. You could push ""sink"" away from the other words, and safely walk across the water. But what if ""water is sink"" is on the other side of a wall, alongside ""wall is stop""? Now you can't get close enough to rearrange those words.  Perhaps there's a way to make something other than the flag be win. Or maybe you don't have to control Baba. This is where the enjoyment of this game begins, as you start rearranging words to experiment with different rules. The main puzzle mechanic is easy to understand, but the complexity comes from all the different words that appear in later puzzles, including ""shut"", ""open"", ""move"", ""defeat"", ""float"", ""hot"", ""melt"", and many more. You can transform an object into something else. You can control more than one thing simultaneously. You can set up an object to push blocks into position while you do something else. Eventually you'll make rules using more than three words. The level design is genius. There are more than 150 puzzles to solve, and the world map is arranged so that at any time you'll have access to 10 or more puzzles. This means that when you get stuck, instead of getting frustrated, you can try a different puzzle, and come back to the other one later with fresh ideas. The later puzzles become very challenging, but they feel great when you finally figure them out. You don't need to solve every puzzle in an area to unlock access to the next one, or to finish the game, but the more you solve the more achievements you'll earn. The length of a puzzle game is quite subjective, but after 25 hours Ive still only solved around 75% of the puzzles. Baba is You is one of the best puzzle games I've played, alongside Talos Principle and Portal. The puzzle mechanics are genuinely unique and I recommend it as an absolute must buy."
5432,2586,"Probably THE best puzzle game out there. I enjoyed everything about it. All the puzzles are somewhat unique but there were so many genuinely clever ones - I was impressed. As any good puzzle game, it makes you feel clever and does not unload all the mechanics at once but instead of tutorials everything is laid out in front of you to play with. It is really well put together.If I could have one criticism - the music does not quite do it for me, especially because when I am solving something for a long time it just gets repetitive. I don't think there's a workaround for that problem. From the puzzle perspective - any level that used 'empty' did not feel right.10/10 - game designed and executed just right"
5433,2586,Baba Is Win
5434,2586,"Very Good, Baba is Wow and Thank you?"
5435,2586,"I have not even finished half of the areas in this game yet, but I love it so far. It's INFURIATINGLY brain teasing on many of the levels I've encountered. Much of that frustration tends to be ""Oh, I didn't know I could do that"" or ""Oh, changing those works like that,"" which could be good or bad depending on your perspective and how you play. It's definitely satisfying when you finally figure out a puzzle, though I'm finding a lot of them tend to be more word-based puzzles than mechanics puzzles.The ONLY real complaint I have about the game is that there is only one music piece when you're in a puzzle. It's not a bad background song and much of the time I forget it's even there, but if you like musical variety, you may want to play the game in spurts rather than long sessions."
5436,2586,"Game is good, but ehh..."
5437,2586,iyi
5438,2586,Amazing puzzle game! Keeps surprising with new interesting mechanics and creative solutions. Highly recommended
5439,2585,Brain Is Melt.
5440,2585,It's great but it  sucks
5441,2585,Normative game rules destruction is fun.
5442,2585,Baba is youYou on buy this is awesome
5443,2585,8.7/10
5444,2585,"As a fan of puzzle games and games with that 'retro' feeling, Baba Is You certainly appeals to both of these.My only complaint is the lack of how much the game actually teaches you about itself. You are given the basic rules and how to use them, but there is so much more to it.There are puzzles within the game that require thinking so tremendously outside of the box that you are only required to do such things for that one particular puzzle, and you never have to do something like that again, and you are not taught how to do these things, nor will you get many hints outside of ""Well that particular word is there, so I must use it somehow."""
5445,2585,hardest puzzle game
5446,2585,Love It!
5447,2585,"I'll keep this short.Baba is You is smart, innocent-looking, and merciless. It's so smart, innocent-looking, and merciless, that it's going to achieve world domination before the end of 2019.Yep. This is how the world ends, not with a bang or a whimper, but with a Sokoban-like. And I, for one, welcome our new vaguely-sheep-looking overlord.If you do decide to get this game -- and you should -- make one pledge to N E V E R look up a guide. Then you may partake of this exquisite puzzler."
5448,2585,"I have somewhat mixed feelings for this game.The game mechanics are obviously innovative, wonderful and constantly surprising. Simply beautiful.As a game, however, I am not enjoying it as much as I hoped. The problem is that instead of planning and figuring things out, I tend just try a bunch of random things and sooner or later something works and the level is solved. In most levels at the early-mid game at least, there are so few moving parts that brute-forcing works.In a couple of levels, I have had the patience to reason things out beforehand. These levels have brought me the most enjoyment.I'm still playing it after over 20 hours though, so I guess I'll have to give it a thumbs up anyway."
5449,2585,Brainlet is me :(
5450,2585,"A beautiful, challenging, and all-around well-made puzzler. Easily one of the top games I have ever played! Particularly well-suited to those who enjoy games with simple rulesets and exponential possibilities!"
5451,2585,"What a wonderful, creative game. Well worth it."
5452,2585,Awesome puzzle game!
5453,2585,"Might be the best puzzle game I've ever played. It makes me feel like a genius and an idiot simultaneously. I looked up solutions more times than I am willing to admit, denying myself the joy of those solutions. (But dangit, there were some points where I just didn't know WHERE to go to get to the next levels.)Every single level - and every single failure - teaches you something. You become a master of the madcap but consistent syntax. Or you think so, but then there comes another level that looks utterly unsolvable... or you think so, but then you reach for an impossible idea that turns out to WORK.Baba is great."
5454,2585,I mean it's good yeah but just...wait for a sale man. It's not 15 dollars good yknow?
5455,2585,"I usually don't like puzzle games, but this one is charming and devilishly creative."
5456,2585,"If you like the concept of changing the rules of the world that the trailer shows, the game explores the idea thoroughly, and I'd highly recommend you play the game. It's the best puzzle game I've ever played, and the only two criticisms I'd have is -It's really hardIf you aren't good at puzzle games, you might struggle a bit (or a lot).-[minor] Lack of musicThere's only 1 track that plays in levels and, while it's a good track, the music does start to grate after so long listening to it. I'd recommend getting your own music if you want more variety.If neither of those things is a problem, pick this game up right now, I guarantee you will love it. If the difficulty concerns you, I'd perhaps wait until it's on sale."
5457,2585,One of the best puzzle games that I ever played.  It's rare to see Metalogic in games.
5458,2585,"(tl;dr: For hardcore puzzle gamers only, otherwise this game will repeatedly make you feel like an idiot.)What is a ""good"" puzzle game?It's one that is challenging, especially in the later levels, but you know exactly what the core mechanisms are. It has zero ambiguity about the basic moves while a great deal of ambiguity on how those moves should be executed. An example of this is the Lemmings franchise. Though there were some horribly difficult levels throughout the games, you never once failed to know exactly what a blocker did. Or what a builder did. Or what any of the other roles did. Your focus was using those roles to get enough lemmings to safety through harder and harder levels. This is a major reason why the franchise was so successful.By contrast, Baba Is You excels at developing challenging levels but fails miserably at explaining what some of the conditions make things do and don't do. It is not just difficult because you do not know WHAT to do; it is too often difficult because you do not know what you CAN do. For example, there's a level where the ""win"" target is also STOP with out any way to either change the target or remove the STOP. And yet to solve it, you have to get Baba and that target onto the same space. Turns out that there is a way to do it that the game simply never explained; it expects that the players will figure it out for themselves.The core mechanic of changing each level's rules on the fly is a clever one. But using the example above, the solution requires deducing a caveat to STOP that the game never explains. It's too easy to think that this caveat doesn't even exist. That's not a good challenge: That's bad game design.If you're a masochist when it comes to solving extremely difficult levels, you may safely ignore my warning and play this game that will hurt your brain so good. But if you're not into that kind of intellectual flagellation, you should know that Baba is You will have you constantly feeling like an idiot. When you do finally figure out levels--and you won't figure out every one--the satisfaction will be minimal, because you'll never know if the next level is one of those tortures that seems designed to make you fail. Save your money and look elsewhere."
5459,2584,"excellent, very challenging puzzle game!"
5460,2584,"Cool idea that is never used.For some reason the main mechanic changes in later levels from the unique idea of changing game mechanics into ""flag is win, you can't change it or anything else in this level. Just figure the movement required to get to the flag"".There's a level where you need to directly calculate the amount of steps required so that you can touch a button with a crate. There's no thinking required, just math. There's another level where you just push text for 10 minutes straight. I checked the solution online, it's the same, long and easy task that I was doing. There's levels where you never touch text, meaning you cannot change the game mechanics. The solutions are obvious, and you never use the mechanic of CHANGING HOW GAME MECHANICS WORK.Later levels never use the main mechanic of the game, or have few levels that do.If you are interested in the main mechanic alone, do not buy this game. This game isn't about the mechanic shown in the first tutorial world and the trailers."
5461,2584,
5462,2584,"A clever, mind-bending puzzle game. This game has just over 200 levels, with a good amount of variety between them. Baba can get quite difficult in some places. As a non-genius, I've resorted to hints a few times to handle puzzles I couldn't make heads or tails out of and recommend the same to most players.Update: After a certain point, the puzzles became too difficult for me. I think there are enough easy/medium levels in there to still recommend the game to most people, but it's clear to me that ""elite"" puzzle gamers will enjoy Baba the most."
5463,2584,too hard. whatever.
5464,2584,enlyre is smartiswin
5465,2584,"I very much enjoyed this game, its quirky style and innovative puzzle mechanics. The presentation was basic but it worked well with the systems and information was usually conveyed clearly, through level design. Thats probably one of the most impressive parts about Baba Is You - theres no tutorial, manual or a guide telling you what to do or how mechanics work. A player has to figure out everything by themselves.This is both the games greatest strength but also its biggest weakness. The puzzles are challenging and with no hints, a player will find themselves mulling over a level for up to half an hour, trying things out. This means getting tired and burned out is a certainty so playing in small doses is preferrable. Definitely dont recommend playing in long sessions, its pretty tiring even though it ends up being satisfying. It also suffered the problem of many other puzzle games in that the music became very repetitive after a while."
5466,2584,"All the other negative reviews on this game are basically spot on. A great idea hamstrung by extremely poor execution. Many of the initial puzzles require you to bend rules in fun and creative ways, but later puzzles often have one ultra-specific solution that is based upon rules/mechanics that the game straight up didn't tell you existed and you're left to bumble into on your own.It reached a head for me in stage 2, Solitary Island, that one puzzle requires you to push text over yourself to complete.Another example is a level in Stage 1, with the very first puzzle requiring you to push text into something to ""sink"" it, which the game never tells you is possible, you're just meant to blindly stumble into it.Continuing on, many levels have different rules that you can't alter in any given way by just locking them off from access, which points you in the direction of those ultra-specific solutions with rules the game forgot to tell you it had. You can't really go hog-wild with the rules to make your own solution, because I see (as I kind of thought earlier) that that would necessitate samey puzzles and lead to the same solution for many of them. Still, I thought I'd give the game a shot, and it disappointed extremely.The music is extremely repetitive and boring too, just to top it off.Watch a playthrough if you wanna see the game yourself, don't buy it."
5467,2584,"Baba is you is an incredibly creative, challenging, and unique puzzle game. There's seriously nothing on the market like it. If your into difficult puzzle games and drink brain hurt juice regularly than this is most definitely for you!"
5468,2584,"Five out of five stars. This game teaches you its rules then gives you all the tools to break them one by one.And just when you think it will be over, it adds a new depth and blows everything up again (your mind included)."
5469,2584,The closest thing to a non-culturally-specific  IQ test I've come across. And a heap of fun.
5470,2584,"Great, addictive puzzle game"
5471,2584,Original
5472,2584,A real mind-bender!
5473,2584,:o
5474,2584,"The game forces you to not only think outside the box, but to make the box, become the box, and then, destroy the box.The puzzles stay entertaining and require you to become more inventive as you progress through the game. I expected the difficulty to plateau at some point, but nope, it just keeps on shooting up like a pixelated rocket on pixel steroids.If you like puzzle games, try it out. And if you dont, try it out anyway."
5475,2584,"I play a lot of puzzle games - this is one of the puzzle game greats.  Up there with Braid, Recursed, and Stephen's Sausage Roll.  Has a mechanic as good as that in Recursed, and puzzle design as good as that in Stephen's Sausage Roll."
5476,2584,"While Baba is You is a fascinating concept, it communicates its rules poorly to its detriment.Baba is You is a game about discovering the solutions to tricky puzzles, and also discovering the rules to the game itself, which you manipulate.  When it's working well,this is a brilliant experience, whether easy in the simple beginning, or dastardly difficult once you've escaped the initial levels.However, the game is designed deliberately to encourage you to build false ideas of how the rules might work.  What does ""Is Shut"" actually mean?  You won't know the first time you encounter it, and your first experiences will probably give you wrong ideas about it.  Later the game will expect you to find those blind spots and fix them in order to progress.  Those experiences, however, are often combined with puzzles that require additional lateral leaps.  Not knowing the ruleset of the system you're working with while simultaneously struggling with a logic puzzle may be joyous to some, but in practice it can often boil down to random fumbling until something you don't expect happens.The game would be much stronger if by level design or available information, it was more readily discoverable what the rules actually are before you're stuck in a complex puzzle with no idea that you missed some important mechanics.  It's not like this is a novel problem in puzzle game design.  All puzzle makers run up against the problem of the solver not being able to make progress or get anywhere in their puzzles at some point. The good ones eventually learn that a poorly clued puzzle is just a puzzle that isn't very good."
5477,2584,"You know that feeling when you beat a hard puzzle and go AH-HA! well, that's not Baba is Youit's more of a ""really? that was it? just had to make my self the whole level and touch the win?""this is not, good game design, that would be teaching you new game mechanics and making you use them in clever ways, this is just cryptic bs where you have to remember and bend every rule you can in order to continue. with some ""line up the guys and set them to move and stop them at the precise right spots"" tediousness.Baba is not currently enjoyable, but i will beat it giving it's two-hundred 2 minute puzzles. Most of which involved figuring out new rules and then breaking those rules later on."
5478,2584,This game is amazing! You are always ask to think outside the box! Play with a friend if you want to progress faster and have more fun!
5479,2584,Amazing puzzler. Example if a game design done right. Worth its price.

5481,2583,"Very likely the best puzzle game ever made. Brilliant.I am in the later stages and have been continually impressed by how the game reinvents itself every few levels. It is customary to attempt a level for the first time and think it is impossible. Then there's an ""aha"" moment, maybe more than one, and it's on to the next thing. Sometimes this takes minutes and sometimes hours so the puzzles are nicely balanced.The game I am reminded of most is Super Meat Boy, although they are in completely different genres. They have a similar success in distilling the best and avoiding the worst of similar games. Baba Is You also has a similar overarching structure as a platformer. Many puzzle games suffer from an overarching flatness of game experience, meaning the last levels are quite similar in difficulty to the first. Here there is quite a bit to differentiate each ""world"" that is centered around a new set of mechanics. As with Super Meat Boy, most players will reach a point where they have to buckle down and spend many hours per level. This high difficulty ceiling is wonderful for a puzzle game as the genre by nature lacks replayability.The aesthetic emphasizes functionality above all but still manages to be cute and easy on the eyes. Overall there is a sense that nothing is wasted. No spoilers but there are some pleasant surprises as well. If you are a fan of puzzle games then you will get what you want here and you will get it in spades.An essential puzzle game."
5482,2583,"      ,       ."
5483,2583,"Just spent 51 hours of game for 100% completion. Sudoku was probably the only puzzle that I enjoyed, and only when I do not have access to internet, that is, until I played this game. I spent every minute of my playtime intrigued and submerged in the game. Overall, 10/10 would recommend.Pros A creative puzzle game that brings a new aspect to thinking outside the box. Highly immersive gameplay, one that's going to challenge your mind... and possibly your sleep. Gameplay is pure gold; it's a work of art. Baba is WinCons The difficulty spike is unforgiving. Understanding the game mechanics is critical to completing the game. For completionists, trying to find missed stages is another headache on it's own."
5484,2583,"I simply don't possess the necessary brain power to play this game. Very unique programming inspired puzzle game that begs you to break the rules. Don't let the cute art style fool you this is the dark souls of puzzle games.9/10 - Roses are red, violets are blue, flag is win, Baba is You."
5485,2583,When you solve the puzzles in this game you feel like a genius. Then you realize how simple the solution was and realize you're an idiot.

5490,2583,"Great game, starts out very easy and slowly increases the difficulty. The music is OK but other than that the game is highly addictive and fun. As someone who doesn't love puzzle games I was surprised I would enjoy this game as much as I did."

5511,2583,"TLDR: Hidden mechanics you will never intuitively nor logically find out unless you accidentally stumble upon it. A puzzle game where you need to stumble upon the solution is not a puzzle game.  (This is my revised review of the game after giving it a second chance. The rest of the review below is my first review, it still stands)The game mechanic of changing the rules seems genius at first, but it'a actually just a novelty. It will slowly become a generic sokoban game. Slow enough for you to play it for more than 2 hours and unable to refund it. I wish i could've refunded mine.Later puzzles has a lot of ""restricted rules""; rules you can't change because they're boxed in or at the very edge of the puzzle. Puzzles usually only have one solution so again, a generic sokoban game. By watching the trailer I thought I could be wild with my imagination and break the rules, nope, ""restricted rules"" stops you from doing that.Introduction of new ""tiles"" are unintuitive and inconsistent. Some solutions may actually feel ""gliltchy""; kinda like ""wait, you could do that?"". With the game mechanincs that's understandable, you break the rules in the first place. I remember one puzzle that made me say ""that's impossible"". It was too simple looking and there was not much to move. But the solution actually requires you to overlap with the text, which feels glitchy. That game never teaches you the new tiles and the byproducts of breaking the rules. You're basically left on your own to see what stick and what doesn't. Some rules can't be overridden too.I can understand some might find the game frustrating to the point of just googling the solutions. And a puzzle game where you need to google solutions is no fun. I'm capable enough to not experience that, but I agree it can be frustrating. This is not a game that you can binge play, you're gonna need to take breaks. The game also requires you to be more creative and experimental more than logical and orderly, I'm not sure if that is a good thing or a bad thing. If you have a 300 IQ and is creative genius maybe you could get something out of this game, but really it's just unintuitive, inconsistent, frustrating, tedious, and generic. The novelty of the game mechanic will wear off. And with 200+ puzzles it will be a drag sooner rather than later."

5528,2583,Turns out is pretty good. I'm liking that the blocks aren't as positionally dependent unlike snakebird and it's more on the word based problem solving.

5557,2583,BABA is YOUBABA is FUNBABA is HARD
5558,2583,Brain-hurting puzzle game that is literally impossible. I love it
5559,2583,"What I like about this game is the unique concept of moving around text to manipulate phrases, which in turn changes the rules of the game. It involves quite a bit of thinking before moving, although there's always the option to restart a level or simply undo your moves. The game is charming and entertaining, and I'd definitely recommend it as a good puzzle game with a twist!"
5560,2583,"An actual puzzle game, not just a brainless clicker or a search for a hidden object.There are plenty of levels and almost each have quite unique solutions. After about a 130 levels the game hasn't been repetitive yet. Amazing level design and most of the problems are very clever.I played this with my friend, hence the short playtime on my account. Highly recommended for puzzle lovers!Edit: after finishing the game 100%, I can honestly say it was one of the best gaming experiences ever. Just buy it, now!"

5565,2583,The level of mind bending game mechanics rivals Portal.
5566,2583,GAME is GOOD
5567,2583,"A puzzle game with a very unique gimmick. Plays like Chip's Challenge, but you make the rules... ...to an extent. So many puzzles I feel stuck on, until I finally get it and feel simultaneously stupid and smart. Great game to pick up and play for 5 minutes or 5 hours."

5574,2583,"a fun, challenging, and adorable puzzle game. the mechanics are fun to play around with, even when changing the rules in a way that leads to nowhere. would recommend for people who like puzzles and don't mind being stumped."

5580,2583,"Fun and challenging. There are a few painful levels, but overall a good set of puzzles."
5581,2583,Awesome game! Never played anything like it.
5582,2583,"Fantastically creative puzzle game. It's hard as heck, and absolutely worth the effort."
5583,2583,"The puzzles are challenging and innovative and characters are cute. What else do you need? I liked that the rules and playing with them resembled coding a little bit, like in those games that teach kids the logic behind variables and how to use them in coding."
5584,2583,"Cute and twisted. Prepare to solve puzzles by actually changing the way objects interact.Sometimes it may seem to be a bit too weird, but when you finally figure the solution out, it would look obvious.Highly recommended :)"
5585,2583,"It starts off very simple, but the puzzles become drastically more complex and difficult. It all makes for a satisfying feeling once you solve some of the difficult levels."
5586,2583,"This game is frustrating. But in a good way, you really feel some kind of accomplishment when you finaly solve a level.But learning how to tweak the rules takes some time.It's really a must have game if you like puzzles games."
5587,2583,My favorite puzzle game of all time.
5588,2583,BABA is PerfectisblowMyMind
5589,2583,"This puzzle game is incredibly adorable and also forces you to think outside the box. The rules are only what you make them, and it challenges the player to analyze their assumptions in order to figure out the solutions. A+, highly recommend."
5590,2583,is good
5591,2583,"It's one of the weirdest but also one of the most interesting puzzle games I've played so far. It blew my mind several times, plays around with mechanics, that can combined shape the world and how it works in mindbending, useful or just silly ways, but it always makes sense. The game is consistent with what it does and while it does some things, that probably nobody could have seen coming, you can wrap your head around it. Play around a little and explore. The game deserves it and you'll probably like, what comes off of it."
5592,2583,One of the most enjoyable puzzles games I've ever played.

5600,2583,"Hesitant at first as i love puzzle games and was worried this would be to easy. Don't get me wrong, i'm not an Einstein level genius but this game has stumped even my smartest friends. Would recommend to any puzzle players!"
5601,2583,Baba is fun
5602,2583,Baba is Pizdec (but cute one)
5603,2583,a amazing puzzle game that is a filled with engaging and fun puzzles and challenges you to think outside the box
5604,2583,Baba is win
5605,2583,I love the game so far but it get difficult fast and it doesn't help I have zero clue what I'm doing. I love the puzzels and the way they you have to solve them. I have also started playing this with my family and it has just been great. Summary: Game is love and 10/10
5606,2583,good game
5607,2583,"This game is a twist on Sokoban. You push words around to make sentences and these sentences change the ""rules"" of the game. While the graphics are nothing to look at and the music is downright annoying, the gameplay is still addictive and fun. If you enjoy the Sokoban style of puzzling and want a twist that adds some logic/programming to it, you'll enjoy this."
5608,2583,"With only a short time placed into this game (so far) the puzzles have left me amazed. The creativity around word usage and level design is simply impressive. While it sometimes feels frustrating, once the solution has been discovered it is very satisfying."
5609,2583,"Yeah, I have absolutely zero clue what is happening. But, it makes me feel smart when something goes right!"
5610,2583,With Portal I would call this the most innovating puzzle game off all time.
5611,2583,very cool
5612,2583,Interesting mechanic to puzzle games. Recommend to get it at 50% discount
5613,2583,"I usually have problems with puzzle games that only have single solutions because the harder puzzles of the genre tend to end up feeling like moon logic. I've only had that feeling once in this game so far, and that's after about 50 puzzles. The vast majority of the time, the rules make sense, the resources you have available to you are clear, and you can see where a puzzle is going well enough to not get too frustrated while mulling it over. It's easy on the eyes with clean, cute graphics, and the movement is snappy with fun sound effects. Everything comes together to make a really immersive experience with what seems to be an insane amount of quality content for the price. Would definitely recommend to anyone who likes the thoughtful side of zoning out."
5614,2583,Solid puzzle game that does things differently than most.
5615,2583,"A fun puzzle game, where the rules of the world are made of objects in the world - and can thus be manipulated. Lots of fun, especially the latter parts of the game."
5616,2583,"Baba Is Review!What an amazing game, right now, the moment I'm writing this I haven't finished all the levels but I played more than enough to tell what I think and express my general impressions so, here we go! Baba is a really special game, the concept was pretty unique since it was announced for the first time, the main concept of this game is ""you don't play under the rules, you make the rules"" and that's awesome, there are tons and tons of different ways to play the game, and that's what makes Baba something special. The game is literally a playground for you to test with different combinations, just a few are correct but not because of that you should not experiment with the options, A door can be the key, a Wall can be Baba, A tree can be water, almost everything is possible with the right word combination and that's just awesome and the puzzles are not something that easy to get, some are really well thought and a bit tricky. Visually is really simple but effective, it's a pretty standard pixel-art with a a great OST at the background, nothing too laud but something more soft which is great. There are a lot of levels and content waiting for you to play with, it's an amazing game, something really different and unique and deserves to be explored, really recommend this game to everyone, it's a puzzle adventure that makes you consider all the possibilities when it comes to make the rules work, tbh, if you like puzzles even just a bit you can't go wrong with this one.Hope you all enjoy it because it's amazing."
5617,2583,Game is simple and challenging.Great game
5618,2583,baba is good and pure
5619,2583,This game was challenging to keep me puzzling for hours.Minimalist art enhances the setting and allows you to work on the most critical elements.Great experience to see my friends solve some levels in completely different and novel ways that I didn't think about!
5620,2583,very nice reflexion game
5621,2583,"This game has a pretty enjoyable puzzle aspect that is fun to experiment with to see what you can do. Some of the puzzles can be frustrating when you can't figure them out, but the reward when you do figure it out is always great. Usually, when you're stuck, it's simply a matter of not realizing that you can do something -- which encourages players to experiment. I highly recommend it."
5622,2583,"A great puzzle game. I find coming back with a fresh mind here and there actually allows me to solve some of the more difficult puzzles.---I beat the game but it wasn't deserved. :( All I needed was a hint for the finale (and someone to tell me about the obvious), and the only thing that existed was a step-by-step solution... :((("
5623,2583,Game is awesome!!! Recommend!

5633,2583,"ProsIncredibly charming and subversive puzzle gameGame's mechanics can be utilised or exploited in a startling amount of unusual waysDecent amount of world map freedom to attempt other puzzles when you get stuckGraphics and shaking is cute; soundtrack gets stuck in your head#SupportSoloIndieDevsToday (not a real hashtag)ConsThe puzzles can get REALLY fiendish early onI seriously cant stop thinking about Baba Is You ever since I picked it up. Arvi Hempuli Tekari is an insanely talented game developer whos previously released Environmental Station Alpha (a metroidvania) and is currently working on Noita (a magical action rogue-lite), and in between these two we have this gem.Its an incredibly compelling mix of Sokoban and pseudo-programming, for lack of a better term. The ingenuity of the game lies in the number of ways that you can rewrite the levels rules by pushing around the text blocks. There are typically a few fixed rules that are shoved into a corner or wall and thus remain true for the whole level, but they are often allowed to be interacted with in other manners (and especially, in the case of one puzzle, you have to somehow find a way to break up a fixed rule). In spite of the fixed rules, you still have a fair amount of freedom with the blocks you are already given - such that finding the correct solution feels occasionally like finding a needle in a haystack!But when you DO eventually get the puzzle solution though, you usually get overwhelmed with at least one of two emotions - 1) feeling like a genius for solving a tricky puzzle, and/or maybe 2) stupidity or shame, for not immediately seeing the solution, or for overthinking it massively. At least, thats how I usually personally felt, and frankly its a wonderful thing. And I am honestly looking forward to experiencing these emotions the more I play the game, as I get up to grips with the new text blocks that get nicely and gradually introduced. This game might look and sound deceptively cute (the sprites are terrific and I have the main menu theme and the lake theme playing on repeat in my head), but its very well one of the best puzzle games released this year.When to buyHours worth of puzzling goodness abound. Highest discount is 30%, but if you have a knack for solving puzzles you'll likely sink enough hours into it to offset the cost even if you pay full price. (Not that that's a bad thing.) 9.5/10"
5634,2582,"Baba Is You is a puzzle game that follows rules of its own, is hard as nails and deeply enjoyable. Do you like games like Stephens Sausage Roll, The Witness or Snakebird? This game is for you.In the end turned out that Babe was not in fact me"
5635,2582,"Charming and somehow relaxed? So far seems a little less frustrating than SnakeBird (which I liked, but got pretty hard mid-way though). A little more logical than pure spatial like SB. Really enjoying the soundtrack."
5636,2582,Are these game designers such geniuses???
5637,2582,Amazing puzzle game with a large connection to debugging/programming
5638,2582,"An incredibly creative puzzle game, starts off simple but the puzzles really ramp up later on"
5639,2582,Incredibly Fun Puzzle game definitely recommend it to any puzzle lovers
5640,2582,"This very original puzzle game will melt your brain. It's simple premise could be described as Sokoban, for the block pushing mechanic, mixed with computer language scripting.You control Baba, a sheep living in a world were the very rules of the universe can be re-written. With you on the board are divers objects. Blocks that form the scenery on a black background, ""text"" that represent some of the backround objects, and conditions such as ""is"". With those text block and conditions you can form sentenses that define the properties of objects on the board. Indeed, ""Baba Is You"" is the very fundamental rule that allow the player to control Baba. Break that rule by pushing a block off alignment, and the little sheep will not respond to your inputs anymore. Do not worry however, mistakes do not mean death, as the game includes a very handy rewind option that allow to go back up to the very first step you took o n the board.With these basic principles, push text, changes the rules, move blocks, your goal to clear a board is to reach the flag. However, the clever player will find unusual way to clear a stage; in fact it is very much expected of you to think outside of the box to ""break"" the rules and be creative to solve a puzzle. The more advanced levels are absolutely devilish in difficulty and you might find yourself stuck and pulling hairs over seemingly unsolvable situation.The game becomes very hard very quick, but if you have the patience for it, it is the kind of brain teaser that will keep you entertained and ponder solutions for dozens of hours as you conquer more than  200 levels. A charming yet challenging experience with minimalist presentation, soothing music and heeps of content. To play on the go or in long binge sessions."
5641,2582,amazing puzzle game 9.5/10
5642,2582,Stupid is you
5643,2582,"A challenging puzzle-solving game with a unique mechanic.If you are willing to stew over puzzles for days, or recreate whole maps on paper, then this is the game for you.If you want something with a bit more fast-paced action, or an in-depth storyline, then it probably isn't the game for you."
5644,2582,The best puzzle game I've ever played.
5645,2582,YOU IS WIN
5646,2582,I'll keep my review simple. I finished like 50 levels and then I developed a new routine in my life. I have to finish a new Baba is you level every day. That way I keep my brain working. This is a great puzzle game.
5647,2582,Steam made me write a review for points. Blame them for this and ignore my post.
5648,2582,Review is Positive
5649,2582,Baba is Good
5650,2582,"Looks silly and innocent, but holy hell is it a brain twister..."
5651,2582,This game makes me feel like I don't have enough IQ to solve any of its puzzles but it's still really funplay it
5652,2582,"One of the best games I've ever played that helped me get into the puzzle game genre. It has very simple controls, graphics, and fundamentals. In the beginning, you'll learn the basic mechanics and breeze through the first two worlds. Easy to learn but hard to master is what's most accurate. As with most puzzle games, it's best to go in blind, but I'll explain the basics. I'd like to note that I haven't 100% completed the game (yet), but I have beat the game.Controls-Movement is purely wasd/arrow keys. It's all tile based and top down.-The undo button is your friend! Give Z a push as many times as you want.-Quick and easy resets with R.-The only other key you will use is space to ""wait"" later on.The World Map-You do not need complete every level in a world to move on, so you can easily switch between levels if you get stuck (which WILL happen). -A certain number of dandelion puffs (?) are required to complete a world. You get one per level. Completing a world will earn you a flower and will unlock 0-2 new worlds. (Note: Completing a world does NOT mean 100% of the world is completed.)Gameplay-Basically, you make the rules of the game by forming sentences with individual words. (Remember syntax!)-Move, push objects, push yourself?-Repeat with a multitude of variations.Graphics-Very simple pixel graphics.-There's a toggle for some settings. Personally, I turn off the constant wobble effect, enable grid, and force high-contrast colors (makes some worlds look way less gross imo).-Character design is cute.-Objects are easily recognizable symbols and get to the point.MusicVery simple, like the graphics. A majority of the time I played with music off and listened to my own stuff in the background. However, this does not mean that the music is bad. It's really relaxing and reminds me of a retro game/lo-fi(?). The whole soundtrack is available on Youtube if you want to check it out https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X98pchrBVu0&list=PLMoZgWjm14OF2AWFfPc3cyQH7T2SC89jo. There's only one track per world, so I could see the music becoming repetitive if you kept it on the whole time.Difficulty-Levels range from extremely easy (usually the levels introducing a new mechanic/word) to extremely hard (usually the extra levels/ later worlds).-The levels never seem unfair. After you complete a level you were having difficulty with, you'll end up saying, ""How did I not figure that out? That was actually so simple!"" or ""WHAT? I'M SO STUPID!!!"" A LOT. -It feels amazing when you don't look up a guide or hints (this guide is great if you need it btw https://www.keyofw.com/baba-is-hint/overworld). The wait until you figure it out yourself is worth it, so please don't do yourself a disservice and look up exact solutions.ConclusionOverall, don't play this game if you don't want a challenge, but if you like puzzle games/want to get into puzzle games, then this a fun way to spend your time. Most importantly, the game is exactly what it looks like (with a few fun surprises that I don't want to spoil), so if it looks fun, then you get what you pay for."
5653,2582,This game is really innovative with its ability to change the rules. Just be prepared to suffer - these puzzles are very challenging and require a lot of outside the box thinking. And that's why I like this game so much.
5654,2582,Solid and mind-bending puzzler.
5655,2582,Very fun and unique
5656,2582,Game is good
5657,2582,BABA IS GREATISME IS NOT BOREDANDHARD
5658,2582,"It's a very good game.-The art style is nice to look at.-The puzzles are fun to solve, but incredibly difficult (it feels like trying to understand quantum mechanics, not very easy to say the least).-it has quite a large amount of levels and with the difficulty of solving them, you'll be spending quite a few hours if you wanna beat game 100%.-the way the levels are organized by themes makes solving the puzzles less frustrating, as concepts are ""explained"" it prior puzzles.so yeah, tis good game, give it a 8.5/10 (the soundtrack is kinda annoying and makes it hard to think so i'm dunking a point)."
5659,2582,Mind bending fun!
5660,2582,"Great brain teaser if you are looking for something like that. Motivating you to think outside the box. Pretty difficult from the middle to the end, so much that you can get stack if you don't wan't to look up the answer. In that case I sagest playing with a friend or partner. One of the best puzzle games after portal."
5661,2582,Good[/h1]
5662,2582,"This game is wildly adorable, yet requires some outside-the-box thinking and puzzle solving skills. Wonderful, a great purchase for people who like a challenge."
5663,2582,One of the most challenging and rewarding puzzle games I've ever played. This is the evolution of puzzle games I have been looking for.
5664,2582,This is one of the most ingenious puzzle games ever made. Starts with a simple concept that gets progressively more challenging as you go. Just amazing. 10/10
5665,2582,This game hurts my brain. But in a good way.
5666,2582,An absolutely amazing puzzle game with a cute little aesthetic to it. It starts off relatively simple but quickly builds off the seemingly simple concept and grows into quite a challenging puzzle game. I wholeheartedly recommend this if you think this would be up your alley. Good luck trying to beat it all! 
5667,2582,"An interesting puzzle game. I liked experimenting with the rules. It gets a bit boring if you play it too long though, so it's not a puzzle game I would put many hours at a time."

5669,2582,TIME IS SINKGAME IS HARD AND FUNBUY IS YOUWALLET IS DEFEATPick it up ya dorks!
5670,2582,"One of the best puzzle games I've ever played. Could be a bit better at explaining how items interact, but most certainly worth your money."
5671,2582,"Me: (playing Baba Is You).Friend: what is it?Me: it's your gf.Friend: what???Me: it is a ""lovely, funny, but sometime unreasonable and even slap you in your face, yell how stupid you are yet you still love it because you can't quit"" kind-of-game.Friend: hmm..."
5672,2582,"An excellent puzzle game that offers plenty of ""aha"" moments between moments of complete frustration."
5673,2582,"A weirdly satifsying puzzle game with defined rules within their own rules.Highy recommended for any type of player, the game itself isn't difficult but it does require some patience in order to solve it 100%.Nice child like aesthetic to the graphic design."
5674,2582,Very intriguing logic puzzle game. Baba is Win!
5675,2582,Puzzle game of a decade! :-) A deep bow to authors for brilliant and original idea.
5676,2582,this game is fum
5677,2582,Fantastic game where you win by manipulating the rules. I haven't seen any puzzle game like this.The difficulty curve ramps up quick early on.

5680,2582,Brain is hurt and happy
5681,2582,Baba is you and hotBrain is meltBrain hurts the same way as when your'e programming. Equally frustrating in a rewarding way too.
5682,2582,"The best kinds of puzzle games start with a simple concept and expand on it to make something complex, and this is certainly a good description of Baba is You. The premise is easy enough - you move words around to make sentences that change the rules of the level. The levels themselves are endlessly complex. 20 hours and I'm nowhere near completing it, even after finding the secret area. Finding the solution to each puzzle is a joy and trying to work out the intricate machinations of the cute little Baba is an amazing experience. It is perhaps marred by some really bizzare and unintuitive solutions, particularly those involving moving two words onto each other, but it is still a fantastic game you should try."
5683,2582,"I'm on like area 3 and this game stumps me on just about every other level. But when I finally figure out a solution it's always satisfying.Word of advice, once you buy this game (you can't not do it) you should probably knock the whole thing out in a small span of time. This isn't one of those games you can leave for a long time and come back to easily. I learned that the hard way..."
5684,2582,"Definitely one of the hardest puzzle games I've played, but its very satisfying when you finally figure it out."

5689,2582,Fun and challenging
5690,2582,"Having been drawn in by the low-res art-style, I stayed for the great soundtrack and challenging puzzles that are very rewarding after you figure out the solution that was right in front of you."
5691,2582,Great game. It gives a lot of satisfaction - especially when you finally solve that level that has been on your mind for past two weeks.
5692,2582,Lovely soundtrack and creative puzzles. Also baba is such a precious boy

5704,2582,"Pretty good visuals, it makes you think about society."
5705,2582,Definitely one of the best puzzle games out. A simple premise that makes the whole game a game of games. Its the right level of challenging that makes your brain hurt with each level and then hate yourself because the solution is so easy. And there are lots of levels that you dont have to go in any order to get through.10/10 would buy again
5706,2582,Great light game to ruin your study. 10/10
5707,2582,"Baba Is You is the only game that has made me jump out of bed in the middle of the night because I managed to figure out the solution to a puzzle before I even realized that the puzzle was in the game.I am unsure if that was a good thing, but at least this is a good game."
5708,2582,"The puzzles in this game seem simple but are so awesome. Clever, tricky and really fun to play!"
5709,2582,Baba is you.You is player.Player play game.Game is puzzle.You solve puzzle is win.That's basically it.You win each level by changing the game's rules and how it behaves.It's fun sometimes hard but fun.
5710,2582,Very fun interactive puzzle game w/ entertaining gameplay!
5711,2582,"A surprisingly fun and challenging puzzle game. There's quite a lot of levels and believe me, you're not gonna plow through them very quickly because some of these puzzles honestly get pretty brutal."
5712,2582,Great idea with the GREAT DESIGN!
5713,2582,"Good cause it's hard, but not unfair."
5714,2582,"Clever puzzles which require thinking ""out of the box"". Overall freat fun especially when playing with a friend to get new ideas into the mix"
5715,2582,"This game has an fantastic amount of varied and different types of puzzles, that at the same time makes you fell like a dumbass and the smartest person in the world.9,5/10 would play again"
5716,2582,very fun. challenging as well.
5717,2582,"One of the most fun and creative puzzle games I have ever played, even if it makes me feel dumb a lot."
5718,2582,"Fantastic puzzle game, as well as a good intro to coding/logic mechanics."
5719,2582,"An awesome game which forces you to shift your perspective on the game world, as the properties of all the tiles can change with every move. Even though it can get a bit tedious when you keep staring at the same level and you just can't think of the solution, once you do figure it out it's very satisfying (and often simpler than you thought). Having an undo button is a really nice touch that prevents you from having to restart every time you make a mistake, and also makes it a lot of fun to try out different solutions. If you want to play a bunch of small puzzle levels that will absolutely break your brain, this game is for you."
5720,2582,One of the best logical puzzle games out there. i can't recommend it enough! 10/10

5724,2582,Great original puzzle game.
5725,2582,"A quirky little puzzler that requires a lot of thinking outside the box.  Some of the puzzles can be devilishly hard, but when you finally find the solution and complete them you you'll say. ""Man i'm an idiot"""
5726,2582,"Very fun and challenging puzzle game, do recommend."
5727,2582,very cool concept for anyone who likes puzzles
5728,2582,"I've just started playing this (literally 20 mins in at review time), but I feel compelled to review this game. It perfectly nails that mindbending aspect of good puzzle games without being too showstoppingly hard, and there's a real sense of accomplishment on the completion of a level. Like the Portal games, there's a very specific way of thinking needed to progress, with new elements being presented along the way. There's also something to be said about the quality of a game that requires no real hand-holdy tutorial.The visuals are charming and reinforce the notion that good concepts are much more important to puzzle games than compelling graphics. The music is simple without being too annoying and repetitive.I'd say that this is an excellent game for puzzle game novices and experienced players alike. It's very approachable and easy to learn, but the difficulty ramps up appropriately.I would 100% recommend this at full price, but especially if it's on sale.update: a bit more time in and it's still great"
5729,2582,This is the best puzzle game of the decade
5730,2582,This game makes me feel like a dumb caveman smacking a rock with a clubFun and creative but challenging.
5731,2582,"This one is an interesting one, one on his kind puzzle game that make you really think about your options, game seems to bespecially designed to mess with your logical thinking, This game is for people who wants to think and solve problems and have a good time, buy if you really want to spend time on the game, you cannot just simply play a few minutes and then go (unless you remember the puzzle and work on it in your head)Pros:+Not a common gameplay style+Easy to learn, hard to just ""be creative""+Active dev and updates+ Help you learn sytaxis and how programming worksConts:-No replay value for ""story mode""-NotBabaisNotYou (can be a pro)"

5741,2582,A must have if you like puzzle games.
5742,2582,"This game really has a great learning curve. When you first start out, it gives you simple rules to work with and when you progress to late game it really throws you into a loop. It's becomes inception at some point."
5743,2582,"BABA is YOU is ME is WE and WE is ALL TOGETHERBadly made references aside, despite the simple premise it is absolutely worth buying, even if I need hints for two thirds of the levels"

5762,2582,Baba is love <3
5763,2582,"This game might be the best puzzle game I've ever seen.Being a logic puzzle, this game could've easily had one gimmick, and get obscenely more complex, get bigger just to have more content.But it evolves instead. It grows, and changes it up without mixing it too much.Instead of fitting the same solutions into new levels, it changes how it thinks.When you are thinking about the sentences in one minute, you start thinking about the movement in the other. Then in another level it introduces something completely new.When you think you might be breaking the game, the game actually wants you to break it more. Every aspect of this game, every simple mechanic, has good puzzles built upon them and it amazes me how nothing in this game stands for nothing."
5764,2582,"Very creative level design with multiple solutions, fun game to make you think."

5769,2582,"I may not be good at this game, but I have family members who have tried it and fallen in love with with this. Ths game is excellent for more visual thinkers who like to always think outside the box, finding loopholes. You don't have to be too creative to try, although you can create some silly outcomes if you are!!!"

5793,2582,Great Puzzles! Love it!
5794,2582,"Baba is You is a funny one; it's very clever and very satisfying when you solve a puzzle, but when you're stuck it just becomes frustrating. I think it would have benefited from a hint system to at least push you in the right direction. Luckily I found a useful thread here: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1687034266 Just enough hint, but not giving away the solution.The graphics work really well for the game and the audio compliments it well. Definitely a game best played in small bursts, rather than in long sitting though!"

5800,2582,"Amazing Game, gets suddenly quite challeging without confusing the player!"
5801,2582,Verly Epin
5802,2582,"The game is a mixture of sokoban and a logic/programming puzzle with adorable graphics and a soothing soundtrack. It starts off quite easy and many of the puzzles offer various ways to solve them, but you also quickly get access to some real headscratchers in the optional levels, which were more tightly designed. The box can be pretty loose sometimes, since there is usually a need to modify the level itself to solve it, so the solutions can feel creative even while they stay inside the limits intended by the puzzle designer. The puzzles (at least in the early parts) are mostly built around one or a max of two tricks, and the necessary elements are mixed into the scenery. Some of the control mechanics for other entities in the levels kind of resembled puzzles from the Adventures of Lolo, back from who knows how long ago. All in all it's a very comfortable game that offers enough challenge to last for a while. An easy recommendation for anyone who enjoys puzzle games."
5803,2582,10/10 really hard levels. Good for those who like challenging their minds.
5804,2582,"Baba is You is an amazing puzzle game that combines simplicity, complexity, and difficulty like no other. Only a couple hours in and it is always finding new ways to make you think outside the box. I would recommend to play it in small sessions as it allows for a fresh set of eyes and avoid aimlessness. Overall, the game is probably the best puzzle game ever made."

5815,2582,"Baba is You is an outstanding puzzle game that takes you through a series of self-contained logical puzzles that encourage an ""outside the box"" mindset. This is one of the most difficult puzzle games I have ever encountered, which makes it all the more rewarding when I successfully complete a level. I am not ashamed to admit I have used a guide a few times for puzzles I have been stuck on for days, but it is just that challenging. It has nothing to do with the faults of the design, but rather it is an inevitability of having a game play system as deep as this one. I found that some sections of the game spike in difficulty, where some worlds offer harder/easier levels than others, but that could entirely be dependent on who is playing.Overall, this is a wonderful puzzle game that is packed charm, and I recommend it for those who enjoy good thought-provoking puzzles."

5825,2582,"Quick version: Buy it if you like puzzle games, try the free Game Jam version if you're on the fence.This quickly goes from standard box pusher in the first puzzle to a completely original type of puzzle game. The sheer number of puzzles the solo developer has made out of this one concept is amazing. The general game design is great as well; there are difficult bonus levels that will make you feel like a genius if you get them right on the first attempt, but later main levels will teach you what you need to do if you feel like going back. Another plus is that you don't have to beat every main level in an area to unlock the next one, with each area having a mechanic it revolves around. So if there's one you struggle with, do all the easy levels and move on to something else for a bit. You won't be put in that frustrating situation where you can't figure out one puzzle so everything else after it is locked away from you.At this point I still have a long way to go, but already feel I got my moneys worth, especially with the sale on."

5837,2582,A pretty great puzzle game to sink time into. The late game levels get a bit crazy but it's worth buying/playing for sure.

5846,2582,"absolutely amazing puzzle game, very interesting concept, extremely fun to just mess around inEDIT: may  or may not be editing this for the game awards, but this game is also difficult on top of brain stimulating, and innovative. Even when I open this game and get no levels completed I still feel fulfilled from the experience alone."
5847,2582,"Interesting, weird, and fun puzzle game"
5848,2582,Absolutely well-executed puzzle game with tons of charm. Give it a shot.
5849,2582,"Way more content than I was expecting. A few puzzles still trip me up, but the game is relatively generous with unlocks. Get stuck and you can switch to a different puzzle easily while you cool your head,Being a programmer the NOT puzzles were my favourite. I want NOT."
5850,2582,I really love this.
5851,2582,Wonderfully clever puzzling fun.
5852,2582,"Baba Is You first looks like a very simple puzzle game with a cute aesthetic until you realize you've only beaten the tutorial section of the game. With each world, the game increases in difficulty but so do the creative options that exist to solve the puzzle. One of my favorite levels is a relatively simple one that at first doesn't make much sense but leads to more Babas on screen than you can imagine. This game is definitely a lot of fun but you'll need to be patient and think outside of the box. You'll also need to experiment with your ideas to find solutions and thankfully the game even encourages this because of its simple ""rewind/redo"" or ""restart"" buttons. Take your time and good luck!"
5853,2582,"If you have you inside you, nothing can stop you."

5872,2582,"A super charming puzzle game that I both simultaneously love and want to beat my head against a wall when I play. The puzzle mechanics are so unique and require so much out of the box thinking with almost every level, that even some puzzles I've gone back to after not playing for a while I still can't quite remember the solution without help."
5873,2582,This game is driving me insane.

5877,2582,"Devilishly hard at times, but very rewarding to work out. Fantastic game and concept."
5878,2582,simple design but the puzzles are great
5879,2582,"Very fresh and unique take on a puzzle game. Essentially, instead of trying to complete puzzles with defined rules, the puzzle lies in how you can manipulate and change rules to reach a win condition.There's tons of content, and you can very easily pick it up and put it down, either doing several puzzles a day or a puzzle every couple of days. The art style is cute and simple, making it easy to look at and process. The music is nice, but can get repetitive after a while spent in the same area.I think people with experience in programming will have an easy adapting to the kind of problem-solving you have to do, but others may find it harder to wrap their head around some of the puzzles. That said, when you finally figure out a solution, you mind will be blown and you'll feel like the smartest person in the world.So, all in all, I highly recommend this game. Check it out!"
5880,2582,"WOW.  I never thought a game could make me feel so dumb so quickly.  But in all seriousness, this game is amazing."
5881,2582,"Super simple concept, super fun game. Highly recommend to anyone who enjoys puzzles."

5883,2582,The game was amazing. To the easy controls to the cute style. But the game isnt easy which i like about it. you need to think outside the box.

5885,2582,GAME IS DONEBRAIN IS DEAD
5886,2582,I personally really like the art style.
5887,2582,"Creative design and mechanics drive this game to be amazingly enjoyable. The puzzles do get hard, but the design is very good at giving you many ""aha"" moments."
5888,2582,"Such a fun game. Puzzles get hard pretty quick and if you don't have good lateral thinking skills this will help you get better, but it will be a struggle. Loved every agonizing moment."
5889,2582,Great game... makes you feel like an idiot trying to solve a puzzle
5890,2582,"A delightful little puzzle game that's deceptively simple at first, then goes on to use its mechanics to their furthest possible extent. Great puzzle design, enough content to keep you occupied for many brain-melting hours, and is a gift that keeps on giving."
5891,2582,"A wonderful little puzzle game, though certain levels are a little harder than they feel like they ought to be when it comes to how early in the game they come up. The music adds a lovely ambiance to the entire experience, to boot!"
5892,2582,"I had no intentions of playing this game, and i was reminded of its existence by a streamer i follow. After a bit of watching the stream, i decided to purchase it pretty much on a whim. This is one of the greatest puzzle games i've ever played, right up there with the portal games. The unique premise of changing the rules to work in your favor is worth the asking price alone, let alone the genius behind the puzzles and how much content there is in the game. It's surprising how far this seemingly simple core concept is taken and never gets dull up until the very end.I could not recommend this game enough to anyone who likes puzzle games, and this game might just win you over if you don't like puzzle games"
5893,2582,Fun thinky game
5894,2582,Good puzzles and great baba
5895,2582,nice
5896,2582,A great puzzle game that starts small and expands upon the original concept in a wide variety of ways.

5898,2582,My favorite puzzle game so far.

5900,2582,Mind-bending and super cool. Exactly the type of puzzler that I enjoy!
5901,2582,Game is Good
5902,2582,"proly the best puzzle game, i've ever played"
5903,2582,Excellent logic puzzle game. Really enjoying it and have already recommended to several people. While the early levels are obvious there's a hard spike in difficulty curve that sent me straight to walkthroughs. Really challenging in all the good ways.
5904,2582,This game does a very unique thing with it's puzzles.I love it and fully recomend it.
5905,2582,"An excellent puzzle game so far, teaches object-oriented meta-thinking. Objects and meanings are freely moved around and reassociated. A key is only a key if it opens doors."
5906,2582,good video game
5907,2582,GAME IS DONEALL IS SLEEPBABA IS BEST
5908,2582,"I am currently playing through Baba is You and think it is a very interesting game. I will post a full review soon, but here are my initial thoughts.Baba is You is game about getting your character to the objective. Your character, the objective and objects on the screen all have characteristics that are based on words that are also on the screen. You can manipulate these words to change things - such as the objective. The objective might be a flag, but you could potentially switch the word flag for tree and then go to a tree next to you to beat the level. It gets complicated because of barriers and object positioning. You cannot always move things if they are in a corner for instance. This game makes you think and is very different from most games I have played. I would definitely encourage people to check it out if they are looking for a challenge."
5909,2582,"Great small puzzle game based on logic and spacial awareness. No coding is required, it breaks it down into caveman speak (Baba is you, Water is hot, Box have key). It's quite challenging mainly because of the spacial aspect of the puzzles. It can also be tricky when the game introduces more elements where certain objects do not collide with each other, but I think the majority of the challenge is around manipulating the logic structures in the right space."
5910,2582,Great puzzle game! I love it
5911,2582,Baba is you. you is confused. confused is always. me is like.
5912,2582,Most difficult puzzle game I have ever played.
5913,2582,"Very creative puzzles, would highly recommend"
5914,2582,"A very difficult game but the complete puzzle gives a lot of satisfaction.On the minus, I have to admit that not all rules are obvious - it probably requires abstract thinking, which is have not enough.One of my top 10 games."
5915,2582,"Good puzzles, very original."
5916,2582,A refreshing take on a puzzle game.
5917,2582,A frustrating and brilliant game to play. It's an amazing concept and it executed it really well. I highly recommend this game for anyone that is up for a challenge.
5918,2582,Very challenging in an unexpected way
5919,2582,Should you buy this game?Yes
5920,2582,love it
5921,2582,"Baba is You is a game where you play as some rabbit thing that constantly dies by transforming itself into inanimate objects.In all seriousness, this is a really cool box-pushing puzzle game where you physically push the game's rules around to suit your needs. It's an interesting mix of sokoban and programming that is constantly throwing new mechanics at you and teaching you new tricks. Just be prepared to have your brain melt, especially in some later levels."
5922,2582,This is a great game that deserves to be played. It is difficult at times but is well worth it when you finally complete it. 9/10
5923,2582,fun and intresting
5924,2582,Baba Is GreatPuzzle Is Awesome
5925,2582,"I am really enjoying this game. The concept is clever and the puzzles are tough. It does a pretty good job of introducing certain tricks / patterns in simpler levels that are then needed for more complex solutions later. The basic idea of being able to change the rules of the level makes for some creating thinking for really unique puzzles. This game seems so simple, yet is so challenging."
5926,2582,"This game is incredibly clever and completing the puzzles has never felt like such a cheese thing. If you're someone who's a fan of just cheesing games, this will be for you, because that's just what completing the puzzles feel like."
5927,2582,"Excellent puzzler. Blends block pushers (a classic and favourite of mine) with logic. A truly novel idea worth experiencing. Basically, the rules are defined with short statements X IS Y (it gets more complicated, but this is the very basic idea), and you can then change the parameters of the level completely: How do walls behave, What can kill you, How do you win, What are you?I'll give one example that put a smile on my face. The flag was defined as the goal, but was seemingly out of reach, so I made my character the walls, then moved all walls simultaneously, and when one of the walls touched the flag, I won."

It feels amazing when the solution finally clicks.I'm excited for the upcoming level editor, also kind of afraid to see what people will make with it."
5966,2582,Baba Is You is simple. You combine and stack proberties to solve a level. Baba Is You is straight forward. Baba is you is hard. You have to think outside the box and bend your mind around non intuitive but very logical concepts to solve a level. Baba Is You Is Crazy
5967,2582,"Cute little puzzle game that can make you feel both really dumb and really smart. Despite appearances there are hours of content.

5971,2582,"Baba is You is one of those tiny gems in gaming.A ""simple"" puzzler at its core it introduces an idea I have not (or at least very rarely) seen implemented in pc-games this far: The concept that the game revolves around changing the game rules itself.In Baba is You the very rules are spelled out clearly in the level: Walls stop you, flags are the goal, and... baba is you. By manipulating those very core rules you solve the puzzle. A very refeshing game in an industry where all to often you get to play titles like ""Shooter game: The other shooter game, reskinned"" or ""RTS Game II: More of RTS Game"""
5972,2582,"Baba is you is a puzzle game, it's a sokoban-like in which you move the rules of the level.For example, in most levels the rules include ""Baba is you"" and ""Flag is win"", in which case Baba has to reach the flag, but you can move the words around so you can change the rules, like swapping Baba for Rock and Flag for Wall, and you'd win if a rock reaches a wall.So it's great, it's interesting, it fun... the only downside is the ugly graphics, but if you don't mind too much about them, Baba is you is win."

6048,2582,"excellent puzzle game with a quirky central premise - all (most) game rules can be interacted with, allowing for direct manipulation of game mechanics within and between levels.the game gets fairly frequent updates (at time of writing) to fix unintentional ""cheese"" solutions and to introduce new levels or features; an in-game level creator/editor may be in the works for custom level packs, which would certainly add a bit of replayabilitythe art and music are simple yet endearing, and all in all it's quite the pleasant and mind-bending experience to play through. I finished the game with 100% completion in ~35 hours the first time through, though your mileage may vary (expect anywhere from 20 to 60 hours to finish the entire game) - note that I replayed through the whole game several times, though obviously repeat playthroughs don't add anything new to the levels, only a knowledge of the solutions and quicker progressin short: 200+ puzzle levels with a cute pixel art style; difficulty ranges from trivial in the ""tutorial"" levels to moderate-hard in later areas; stresses an awareness of the game's rules at all times and an open mind; overall a substantial amount of content for the price and definitely worth playing if you enjoy games in this genre"

6052,2582,"I really can't say enough great things about this game. You might be turned off if you're not a fan of the minimalistic art style (which reminds of games like Minit or Undertale), but if that's the case you're likely not to care much about puzzle games anyway. If you do like puzzle games and are itching for one with a clever, original idea, this is it.Simple put, every stage of this game comes with a set of rules defining attributes for objects and the environment around you (such as walls stopping you from moving or rocks being pushable or even what character you play as). In order to beat each stage, you have to manipulate those rules. Rules for every stage are written in text boxes that can be pushed around to turn off or enforce new rules that completely change how the environment works.Sometimes puzzles are entirely different from the ones that came before. Other times there's one minimal change that nevertheless forces you to come up with an entirely new solution. Sometimes the solution will be easy to quickly figure out. Other times you will be stumped for quite a while trying to solve what looks like an insurmountable obstacle.The really good thing about this is that due to the nature of the game design no puzzle feels unfair. Whenever you finally realize the solution you get a satisfactory ""A-ha!"" feeling rather than a frustrating ""How was I supposed to have thought of that?"" moment, so even when a puzzle gets head-bashingly hard you still a sense of satisfaction once you complete it.Still, there are a couple of anti-frustration features, like the fact that you don't need to complete all puzzles in succession, as some of them can be played in any order, and you don't need to complete every puzzle of every level in order to advance to the next one.As it is, though, you'll likely want to complete all puzzles anyway just because it's so much fun to do so. The fact that the game is designed to make its puzzles organically follow an established set of rules not only makes the game hard but fair, but you never feel the sensation of poor design you get in other games when you stumble on a solution the developer didn't think of and find out it doesn't work. Here, if a solution is correct, it'll always work, which rewards creativity.I could spend a good more time singing this game's praises, but I'll make it short: buy it, play it, have fun."

6068,2582,"This is a fascinating and challenging game and it's enlightened me to a pet peeve of mine that I didn't realise was so bad. I like going in order, checking off things like a list but that's not very realistic in this game as the levels as well as areas have variable difficulties. Being open minded is the key and, through that aspect, it is very relaxing. My only real complaint is that I have not figured out a way to back out of a level without closing the game entirely and when I still want to play but get stuck on several levels in a row all of that rebooting of the game can be annoying. I still absolutely recommend the game to puzzle lovers but don't think it's something that could, or should, be finished in one sitting and take it in stride instead!"
6069,2582,My last brain cells fried within the first 30 minutes.....15 hours to go!
6070,2582,"Baba Is You is deceptively simple. While its central mechanic may be easy to understand initially, it very quickly becomes devilishly difficult and makes for some incredible brain teasers. Beneath this game's cutesy exterior lies a cold, hard logical core that will twist and snap your mind like a twig.It is a frighteningly clever game, both in terms of its design and in terms of what it expects of its players. Sadly, that comes with a steep learning curve and the woeful lack of a hint system, which means that for the harder puzzles is no middle ground between staring at the screen in befuddled confusion and reluctantly looking up an answer.Is Baba Is You a good game? Undoubtedly. Is it easy? Not at all."

I'm normally not a fan of puzzle games because it becomes more of the same type of format as you continue through the game. Pretty much every level of this game requires breaking outside of your previously conceived notions and going for a new and unexpected solution. If actual problem solving is your jam, this could very well be the game for you."

6086,2582,"One of the best puzzle games I've ever played. Extremely fun and interesting. While there are a few dud levels (like maybe 5-10), considering the game has ~225 levels that is to be expected. Since almost everything about the game is perfect, there isn't much to say except the negatives.The biggest flaw of the game is two fold:1.) The timing of some interactions is confusing and some of the ""puzzle gimmicks"" are a bit obtuse such that you'd never really get it without trial and error. This is not that major of an issue though.2.) The bigger issue is the structuring and difficulty of the levels. They jump all over the place and are seemingly organized by a few keywords, thematic ties, and gimmicks. However, that will sometimes have you trying to complete levels that you don't have enough background knowledge gained from earlier puzzles to solve. This can be extremely frustrating when another level teaches you a certain mechanism that might be required for other levels. Without a true level structure you can be ill prepared for other levels simply by not doing them in the ""proper"" order.Besides those issues, the game is pretty much flawless. Once it gets a map editor and a few polishes it will be one of the best puzzle games of all time. Solid 9/10."

6088,2582,"I may not have played this much, but i can tell you with confidence that this is the best puzzle game i've ever played, and might be the best one i've seen yet. If you think you'll be interested at all, its worth it, trust yourself."
6089,2582,"If you like to stare at the screen and think about whether Baba should truly be You (spoilers: it doesn't always need to be), this is a game for you.The idea is very innovative and it actively breaks the rules imposed by common sense, such as that a wall does not necessarily have to stop you, or that reaching the flag is not always the way to win (e.g. you can make something else the winning condition, or make the flag be you). Once you boot this up, you'll start feeling the smell of burning brains and sounds of grinding gears in no time.As with many puzzle games, you'll sometimes be sitting staring at the screen for a few minutes, but finding the solution is very rewarding. (And do me a favour, don't spoil the solutions you know for others if you let them play it.)In my opinion, being a programmer also makes it easier because we sometimes have to think outside the box too (or strictly with defined rules only).This is also a very lightweight and small game (~115 MB only!) and it loads up immediately, so you can play it on literally any PC or laptop that runs Steam."

6093,2582,"Absolutely stunning, Baba Is You is quite possibly the best puzzle game I've ever played. The game gives you words that dictate game rules, and you determine a way to solve the level using rules you create. Wall in between you and the goal? just  become the wall  and walk into the goal. And that's just a simple example. There are a number of very complex puzzles that give you incredible satisfaction when you realize the solution, you feel clever when you find a roundabout way to get to the goal besides the ""intended"" solution. As the game progresses you oftentimes have little or no opportunities for solutions other than the intended method, but even so it doesn't feel like you're being led down a pre-determined path, as every step of the way requires thought and experimentation. If you have trouble with some levels, they are able to be skipped, and aren't required to complete the world. While I think I'm pretty experienced with puzzle games, I don't think there are too many levels that are too difficult assuming you're willing to spend a bit of time thinking and trying out stuff. Baba Is You provides a unique experience and executes it's premise in a perfect way. the game is very intuitive but still houses many interesting mechanics and interactions that allow you to keep learning how the game works. It's difficult to replay many puzzle games due to knowing most of the solutions beforehand, but even in that scenario, you can still impose a challenge on yourself to find an alternate solution, which adds a good bit of replay value to the game, not to mention there are over 60 unique levels, with many bonus levels that are just more difficult versions of other levels. Fantastic game, low price, I  highly  recommend, 10/10"
6094,2582,"Funny but complex little puzzler, like the thinking out of the box"
6095,2582,"Fun strategy game, but sometimes you have to actually glitch the level to complete it."
6096,2582,this game made me realize my iq is low
6097,2582,"Best puzzle game since Stephen's sausage roll, The Witness, The Talos Principle and Portal 2.If you're a software programmer you're especially gonna love this."
6098,2582,"hard but simple game, so many solutions to some puzzles will keep you playing for hours"

6101,2582,IQ is growing
6102,2582,"I'm too dumb for this game. You're probably too, but should still try."
6103,2582,One the best puzzle games i have played in a while. I enjoy the way mechanics combine together to create increasingly complex puzzles.
6104,2582,It's pretty good brehs. Fun and bubbly puzzling game.
6105,2582,Baba Is You is an amazing puzzle and there is really nothing to dislike about the game at least not in the short while I've played the game. The games concept of changing the rules to solve the puzzles is intriguing and fun.I would recommend this game to anyone who has the patience to think and to those who like to think outside of the box
6106,2582,Clever puzzles and simple design. One of the most innovative games I have played. It is a must buy.
6107,2582,"Pros: is quite fun and addicting to play.  Cons: You'll have to fight the urge to look up the solutions to harder puzzles. like how the frick do i complete half of these, those are impossible.I'm sure it only gets better from here."
6108,2582,"My brain likes it, I think."
6109,2582,A puzzle game with a clever concept inspired by coding and simple cute graphics.
6110,2582,"The game offers a  seemingly simple concept of a logical puzzle, but boy it can get complicated. Definitely worth playing if you're not afraid to struggle with multi-layered problem solving."
6111,2582,"Game of the Year, and easily the best sokoban game I've played. Baba is You explores all of its gimmicks incredibly well, and seemingly has an endless supply of them up its sleeve. It also understands how to properly challenge the player. Some levels focus on an ""Aha"" moment, 1 fresh idea or move that's required to solve the puzzle. While others may simply be fun, asking the player to come up with their own creative solution to the problem presented. And it rewards creativity constantly. Many levels allow for multiple solutions, and if they don't then that's usually because the lesson being taught it important for future content. Finally it'll only require you to complete a handful of puzzles before unlocking the next area, and because areas tend to offer branching paths this opens up the game to a variety of players. Whether you'd prefer to fully complete each area before moving on to the next, or skip around exploring the easier gimmick introductions, Baba supports it.TL;DR - If you enjoy puzzle games, you'll fall in love with this."
6112,2582,Hard and I hate it. Very fun.
6113,2582,"This has to be one of the best puzzle games I've played.After you play it, you begin talking in the terms of the game, imagining what the rules would look like for the real life scenarios you find yourself in. You repeat back to yourself the clever rules you wove in the levels that initially had you stumped but made you feel like a complete genius for solving.That's what you want in a puzzle game, something that seems impossible at first but opens up its solution when you give it a real good think and rewards you with the feeling that you are essentially Einstein.Yet all you did was make ""BABA IS WIN"""
6114,2582,I LOVED this game. I actually 100%ed it.It's definitely a good buy if you like things that are meta and unique.

6117,2582,reallll illlll
6118,2582,"A very creative and original puzzle game, which has great fun playing with classic genre tropes. Each world introduces new keywords which all lend themselves to creative lateral thinking puzzles. Every mechanic is (literally) self-explanatory. You have the ability to undo any number of moves so you'll never have to repeat everything due to a mistake.I should also mention that the *content* of the puzzles is also entertaining and varied. Each level paints its own story in its setup+solution. Some of my favorites so far include a poem that you have to scramble into your solution, one where you need a ""friendly"" ghost to push you down a hallway, one where you need to stop being the main character long enough to get pushed across some deadly terrain and then somehow regain control, and one where you have to alternatingly throw yourself and your name into water until you can make a sentence that turns you invincible."

6124,2582,"This game is deceptively layered. It looks cute and simple at a glance, but trying to solve some of these puzzles feels like playing a game of 4D chess.Baba is fun."
6125,2582,This game is freaking hard but makes you feel like a genius when you solve it. 200 IQ moments every time you realize how to beat a level.
6126,2582,"Easily one of the best puzzle games of the decade.My only problem is that the game has a lot of trouble showing you how it's rules work. I think the dev expected people to figure it out, but many times it can be a real head scratcher. I won't deny that I looked up some walkthroughs for some of the levels."

6138,2582,i highly recommend this game. it is rlly good if u just have some free time and want to play some weird and unique puzzle game(weird in a good way) i don't really even like puzzle games but this one is insanely fun so far. my opinion might change later but i highly doubt it
6139,2582,cool game will screw your head but always fun
6140,2582,"Everything a puzzle game should be.The gameplay in Baba is You centers around moving around blocks containing concepts and logical connectors to make rules that operate the game.  ""[Baba] [Is] [You]"" literally means that you control Baba in the game world.  You complete levels by messing around with these logic rules until you can create a win condition, e.g. ""[Flag] [Is] [Win]"".  As you may imagine, increasing the number of words and connectors exponentially explodes the number of possibilities you can create, so you have to be clever and act with a goal in mind rather than trying things randomly.The difficulty ceiling in this game is astronomical, to the point where I've spent hours on some puzzles and still not cleared them.  However, there's hundreds of others to choose from and the game includes many quality of life features like ""undo"" and ""restart"" buttons which are very quick and easy to use.  It's also pretty good about making the hardest puzzles not be roadblocks so you can make a lot of progression even if you struggle on the hardest parts of a world.Baba is You is a puzzle game straight up with nothing getting in the way or slowing you down.  At least several hours of fun for an average player and dozens more for those willing to struggle to uncover and leverage the game's more bizarre and complex logic."
6141,2582,Awesome game. Quite challenging and an interesting puzzle mechanic
6142,2582,this game makes you big brained
6143,2582,Simple gameplay and minimalist design but mindblowing puzzle game. A must have !
6144,2582,"Simple at it's core, Baba Is You evolves it's complexity and creates puzzles within itself, some puzzles only evident far far later. The puzzles are extremely rewording and the non-linear fashion of the levels allows for a lot of versatility to return or abandon different levels. Extremely highly recommend this game, the gameplay is amazing and rewarding."
6145,2582,A must have for any puzzle enthusiast.  The puzzles in this game will really stretch your critical thinking skills.  My only complaint was that some of the solutions required interactions that behaved counter-intuitively.
6146,2582,This is an insanely good puzzle game. Every solution makes you feel like you're actually smart and the puzzles are quite clever. Definitely a unique and great puzzle game.

6154,2582,"Gorgeous game with hard and rewarding puzzles, perfect music and a really cute designe."
6155,2582,A great puzzle game that will make you question your intelligence sometimes because you spent 45 minutes on a level trying to do a complicated 200 step solution that doesn't even work when the real answer was just 6 moves or something.Great for short bursts when you don't have enough time to play a game that requires commitment.

6192,2582,"Definitely one of my favourite games. This game is based on a simple concept, but it's used to its full potential. ""Baba is you"" constantly suprises the player with clever levels, even when you think you figured the game out. I cannot stress how good of a game this is. It teaches you new concepts, and then puts your knowledge to the test in ways you wouldn't expect it to. The game encourages you trying to ""break"" the levels, often with hilarious results. ""Baba is you"" is a perfect example of what a good puzzle game should be.I should also mention that the game is hard, some of the levels took me more than half a hour to find the solution, and I haven't entirely finished the game yet. I am both scared and excited to see what will the later levels look like.Tl;drbaba is best and hard"

6207,2582,the greatest puzzle game of All Time
6208,2582,"The game has a simple core mechanic, yet the same simple mechanic creates some very devious puzzles - you need to be able to think outside the box to be able to solve everything. 10/10 would torture my brain again. Could be a bit longer though."

6213,2582,baba is good
6214,2582,"Baba Is You is a flawless game. And this is no exaggeration. This game is everything it claimed to be and even more. I had only one fear when purchasing the game, and it was that the game might be too short (only a few worlds with ~10 levels each). I was pleasantly surprised to see that the game is infact, really really long. So I want to go a bit more in depth. This game is based on a really unique aspect, and that is that you control what things do inside a level. Normal rules on any other 2D puzzle game would be that wall stops you and flag is win. In this game though, wall can be you and flag can be stop. This mechanic that the game is based on is simply genius, and having had a lot of experience with 2D puzzle games in the past, I can safely say that it's extremely unique and original. Another amazing thing about this game is how there are new mechanics being constantly introduced. Thatmakes all the levels unique and fresh, even the bonus levels ,which are slight alterations of others. If I could find a drawback in this game, it is that it is a really difficult game. It needs consentration and patience to play it. That is a great advantage at the same time though, because if the player is in the mood to play this game, it will definately be a great time. I feel like 6 hours of gametime barely scratch the surfice of this game, and having seen other reviews, I think it is true, this game just keeps on getting betterClosing thoughts: Baba Is You is the best modern puzzle game I have ever played. Its a fresh, new and unique experience and I would recomend this game to anyone who has time to invest in it 10/10"
6215,2582,"Excellent logic puzzle game.  There's a couple of mechanics that don't get explained well, but they're the exception, not the rule.  Challenging at times, but satisfying.  Just a very good set of simple brainteasers."

6228,2582,"BABA is YOUREVIEW is WRITEBaba is You is a neat little ""Think around the corner"" Puzzle game working on something akin to simple programming logic. You play as the titular BABA (a white, dog-like creature) and try to reach the flag to win the level. to do so you can play around with some objects properties by moving words around, so while a wall stops your progress look for the word group [WALL] [IS] [STOP] and break it up. and suddently you can go through walls.the game starts up with simple puzzles to get the mechanics down but after a few stages the levels become deviously head-scratching. and oftentimes a strategy that worked in 4-5 will spell disaster in 4-6. the game thrives on you having to work and trick mechanics by using the IS YOU or IS WIN commandsthe graphics look lovingly hand drawn and the music is pleasing.

6243,2582,"Baba is Hard and Rewarding.As someone who enjoys puzzle games immensely, it's been a long time since one really challenged me to the point of getting out a notepad and paper in order to solve it. The game starts off easy and immediately shows you what it is all about with some simple initial levels that are still really fun thanks to the unique way in which the puzzles are presented. This difficulty soon ramps up though, and it wasn't long before I was skipping levels with the intention of solving them later when my brain had a few days to reset itself.While the difficulty can jump around quite significantly at times, a lot of this is due to its nature as a puzzle game. There are certainly a few later levels that were much easier than ones that came before, and asides from the occasional solution that feels a little ""unfair"" or ""unintended"", the vast vast majority of them are excellently done.I don't wish to spoil the much later levels, but boy when you think you've finished there are still secrets to be found, in some of the most unique and bizarre ways I have ever experienced.Also Baba is Cute."

6265,2582,"Baba is You is awesome and hardBeatiful puzzle game with cute art, decent music, insane mechanics and extreme hard difficulty. The main feature is that words, you can find on a level, control all things happening. Almost all levels require you to think outside the box. Some levels are insanely hard, they will definitely make you feel yourself dumb. Surely the best puzzle game i have ever played.  Me is recommend"
6266,2582,"makes me feel like either an absolute moron or a 10000 IQ genius, i love itsuper fun and an interesting concept but be prepared to slam your head against the wall for hours trying to solve some of these puzzles"
6267,2582,Baba is YouGame is GoodGame is WinBaba is Win
6268,2582,Baba is Me *sadpepe*
6269,2582,"So I am kinda new to this game and I don't know how to unlock those flower tokens or whatever they are,I suppose I can get those by playing on more advanced levels I guess but the idea of this game is nice,to win you need to think outside of the box"
6270,2582,"If the unique aesthetic drew you to Baba Is You, you'll be sure to stick around for the even more unique ways in which you'll solve its puzzles. Each level gives you its rules and allows you to literally break some of them to make new ones - which makes every Win that You get a mixture of ""Oh, THAT'S how!?"" and ""...That was way too obvious, why didn't I think of that?"".Have you ever seen a baby trying to figure out how a spoon works? That's how I felt after a few hours with this game."
6271,2582,"Ive barely scratched the surface on this one but wow it exceeded my expectations already. Basically you gotta enjoy puzzle games that may or may not frustrate you. This game is very literal in what you need to do and it will most likely make you scratch your head, I cant even imagine what the later levels will entail. Highly recommend it, its pretty unique and very enjoyable."
6272,2582,"Honestly the best puzzle game I've ever played. Unique concept, well designed levels, and a bizarre but brilliant end game.Charming aesthetic and fairly responsive controls for a puzzler, which makes a bigger difference than you might expect as you're vacantly pushing around words and undoing to make sense of the levels. If you don't mind being reduced to spouting gibberish like 'if baba is you and wall is baba what if wall not.. baba not.. not is baba wall?' while staring dumbly at a screen as a jimmy neutron style brain blast rocks your mind open, or the occasional difficulty spike, you'll probably have a great time with this game."
6273,2582,"Puzzles are inventive, with mechanics that are simple at their core but lead to some truly excellent challenges. One of the more clever puzzle games I have played in a while."

To restore balance of good and evil (reviews) in the world, but I doubt my single review will have any effect since the game is overwhelmingly positive.Just buy it, it's on sale anyway, you won't regret it."
6283,2582,A fun game that is quite the brain teaser. Like all great puzzle games it takes a simple concept and explores it thoroughly. It also has a fantastic undo feature the makes it easy to try solutions without having to start from scratch each time.

Even if you're not good at puzzle games, I'd still be heavily tempted to recommend it anyway just for the sheer creativity of it and having your mind blown numerous times over all the crazy things you can do; wonderful stuff."

6327,2582,The most simple complicated game I've ever played. The rules seem simple: Push the words around to change the objects and get to the finish. But every few levels requires you to rethink what you thought you knew. Lava in the way? Just push it over. Can't get Baba to the flag? Just become the rock in the other room. Even the levels that change just one rule become an entirely new challenge. I absolutely recommend this game to anyone who likes being forced to think way outside the box.

6360,2582,"I'm honestly shocked that I didn't like this game. tl;dr Baba Is You is an awesome logic puzzle game that, roughly every other level past the first world, makes you do your taxes before you can continue playing, and if you make a single mistake and don't immediately catch it you have to start over.The game punishes you - severely - for not being a chess computer that plans 25 moves ahead before taking a single step.Basically, there's two puzzle games going on in any Baba level - the one where you figure out what objects you need to carry across the level to get the right ___ IS ___ AND ___ sentences set up, turning the rules on and off and moving things in to the right position to take advantage of the changing rules... and the incredibly tedious Sokoban-esque tile shuffling required to get the pieces in to the places they need to be in order to demonstrate to the game that you've solved the fun puzzle. I know exactly what I have to do, but every time I try to move my pieces in to place I end up accidentally pushing something in to a corner or behind something else so I have to undo several steps back to try again - or I realize I accidentally moved something one tile too far to the left twenty five steps ago and I have to re-solve two thirds of a puzzle I've already solved because I subtly painted myself in to a corner.You can think of it as a good game with bad controls - it's very difficult to predict what effect your control inputs on the individual block and tile scale will have on the whole-level scale, and in the levels that are meant to be a challenge rather than a tutorial your actions will usually just screw yourself over."
6361,2582,Great Game!
6362,2582,"Baba Is You and good and me is dumb.Baba Is You and is a Sokoban-type puzzle game about manipulating rules, made by Hempuli, who had previously made the lesser known (and underrated) Environmental Station Alpha. Baba is quite a departure from that game in terms of genre and atmosphere, though for those familiar with the second half of ESA you would have recognised his fondness for puzzles. It's also much more light-hearted and quirky than ESA - everything has this derpy look and wobbly effect that makes the game look surprisingly cute (and Baba may be my favourite abstracted animal-type creature in recent memory). The music also has a mellow, lo-fi sound that eases the potential frustration of puzzle-solving.The best thing about Baba is that Baba is you, but also that 'thinking outside the box' is an ideology that's central to this game. The game is literally about making and breaking your own rules: a skull could mean defeat or it could also be you; a wall might be something that impedes movement or is what wins you the level (or is you). Gradually new keywords and mechanics get introduced as you unlock new zones until it feels like there's an entire logical grammar based on them, and the game utilises them very well in its puzzles. A solution rarely feels the same for any two puzzles, and little time is spent tutorialising new mechanics with filler puzzles. Some keywords are particularly amusing to play around with (the Chasm zone is a personal highlight), and some levels have some especially mindblowing solutions (e.g. The Floatiest Platforms, and a certain Scenic Pond level). A small issue is that a few keywords did not feel like they were explored to their fullest extent (e.g. directional keywords, Facing, More), although the promise of a level editor would alleviate that somewhat.Baba is not an easy game to complete - I'd put it as harder than The Witness, and while the puzzles are more bite-sized than Stephen's Sausage Roll's some of them are on the same or even higher level of difficulty. There are many 'extra' levels that are both genius and diabolical in their design, iterating upon a previously existing level but with a few subtle changes that make it far more difficult. Even in the first world there may be levels that are that remain unsolved until you suddenly have an 'eureka' moment five worlds later. The beauty of this game though is that even those who rarely play puzzle games can experience most of the overworld due to the leniency of the area completion threshold, the freedom to choose multiple different levels at almost any point and the accessibility of the introductory levels in each world.Puzzle solving in Baba is inherently based on experimentation - it's nearly impossible to visualise a solution simply by starting at the initial state of the level. There's potential to feel as though you stumbled across a solution by pure chance, but the level design manages to steer away from that fairly well - every element in a level usually has some reason behind its inclusion. Deductions are often a case of 'what if these keywords could be arranged this way', or 'is it possible to manipulate the level into a specific state'. That said, there were some puzzles that felt far too open or unintuitive as to where to start, and a few that focused on a niche application of a keyword without easing the player in first. The developer has been open to suggestions though, and since I started playing the game certain behaviours have been made more noticeable, and several levels have been designed to be more intuitive to approach while maintaining the same solution concept.There's a wonderful sense of discovery in Baba: seeing what a keyword does for the first time, or wondering what new keywords might appear in the next zone, or simply how many levels there are. For those who have finished ESA you may be expecting some sort of twist in the middle of the game; I certainly was. To my delight, this indeed does happen in the form of a keyword called Level, where the level itself can now be manipulated and turned into objects. The rules at the bottom right of the overworld suddenly have a purpose, and 'winning' the overworld rewards you with yet another world one layer above it. This moment of discovery happens multiple times, where gradually the rigid concepts of the game begin to unravel themselves. Everything appears to be fair game now: letters that constitute keywords take up their own individual spaces, the level select maps themselves become large meta-puzzles that require the manipulation of its sub-levels to complete, and even the cursor that selects the levels themselves may be transformed. The true ending that is unlocked after traversing the final world (coincidentally titled Meta) caps the game off wonderfully, starkly contrasting the happy earlier one with a spoonful of existential dread. It's true to the style of ESA - once again I wish the game had gone even deeper with that aspect, though understandably enough this isn't much of a game for story.To put it succinctly, Baba is one of the best games that's come out this year. It has an extremely novel concept that is developed thoroughly, with a satisfying amount of content that feels rewarding to complete. I spent about 35 hours focused on completing the game, with extra time revisiting levels and trying out the early version of custom level functionality. This seems to be on the low end though, and your time will greatly vary depending on how quickly you pick up on the mechanics and levels. Even at full price the game is absolutely worth it, and with an official level editor and new mechanics on the horizon my wholehearted recommendation can only get better."
6363,2581,"one of the best puzzlers i've played in years! unlike games similar to snakebird which start off simple and become incredibly difficult within a few levels, baba is you has a steady curve and forces you to think outside the box, especially as you progress further and further into the game. often times the execution of a solution takes less than a minute, but the thought process behind the solution is what takes the most time to piece together. could not recommend enough!"

For every good puzzle there's 5 others that use mechanics you have never been taught, are made entirely for the purpose of misleading you but not in a way where it's actually clear you've been misled, (meaning you'll just keep trying it in slightly different ways for ages, but of course it never actually works and the real solution was something completely unrelated) or have countless steps to them. (And there's a lot that use unexplained mechanics. Expecting you to just stumble upon them when trying every solution possible in a desperate attempt to finish it) It becomes nothing more than a frustrating mess where you'll look up solutions and instead of saying ""welp i'm dumb"" you'll just say ""how was i ever supposed to think of that?"" And this is the case for atleast half the levels so far and I'm only 2 hours in (no refund :( ) and i've heard it gets much harder lategame, that sounds like a nightmare.Good idea ruined by terrible execution - 1/5(also my goodness the music is so obnoxiously repetitive)"

In Baba there is not a specific technique: the difficulty is all pure logic. This means that even after a few months you can go back to Baba and you will be able to play the most difficult levels without restarting from the beginning because you forgot the ""technique"".

6393,2580,"This is one of those games where I really wish I could just write a review and not choose either Yay or Nay because neither really captures exactly my thoughts on the product proper. I'll summarize my thoughts below:First off, the premise of this game is divine; the inspired concept of rule bending to solve an otherwise impossible puzzle is truly inspired and exceptionally unique. The first parts of the game were incredibly fun, finding weird and interesting ways to solve various levels was what made the game as fun and interesting as the reviews make it out to be.But once you cast aside the starting region; things begin to take a turn for the mundane. The fun rule bending concept is suddenly clamped to the form of a single solution to every puzzle and you find yourself no longer trying to think outside of the box; but rather being forced into a single viable solution with a set of steps that need to be followed to win.In the context of a pure puzzle game, this isn't strictly a bad thing; harder puzzles usually mean the solutions are more tightly wound. The problem is that the core tenant of this puzzle game is rule bending; and what makes rule bending fun is that you don't usually /have/ to adhere to any one singular solution to anything; being able to think outside the box to solve a level is what makes or breaks the concept as a whole and what ultimately makes it fun and engaging.Whats worse; is that what few examples of truly creative solutions that players have discovered for some of the later levels that allow them to ignore certain 'words' or 'phrases' is apparently unintentional enough to warrant developer action to make those solutions no longer viable; further cementing the idea that the game has taken the wrong approach for its concept; at least in my eyes.Ultimately, it winds up being an example of a really cool idea that completely fails to live up to its potential; but still results in some tricky and interesting puzzles, at the very least. I can still recommend it to anyone who likes a good puzzle or two."
6394,2580,"There are not many single player games that I've played for more than 100 hours - it is one of them, and it is not a game made by some large company. The concept is really simple and each puzzle can be executed quickly even though some levels may take hours to understand the main trick. Special thanks for the the part beyond the main one in the game, this is awesome! Just when you thought that you understand how the game works, it sends you deeper and rules start to matter everywhere, you may even start to see them in your room, but I hope not. One of the best puzzle games I remember, for sure.Graphics, music, controls are simple, but I like the way these are done and overall style is pleasant. Though after some tough levels I had to turn off the music, some of it was hard to listen over and over, but, well, partially it is because of my slowiness.Thanks for the game!"

As a matter of fact, I rarely make recommendations, instead couching my opinion of a game behind (apparently) humorous rhetoric so as to better communicate how a particular thing made me feel, with maybe a pittance paid to actually recommending it to others.Here I'd like to break kayfabe and say Baba is You is a wonderful puzzle game experience and you owe it to yourself to give it a shot. I've never had more fun staring at a screen, thinking."
6401,2580,"It's definitely a unique concept, and it's considerably well executed, but it unfortunately still feels dull. Controlling Baba just feels awful, and there's little in the way of interactivity outside of pushing blocks. It can be incredibly frustrating accidentally pushing a block the wrong way and ending up having to reset the whole puzzle.After about an hour, the novelty of the concept wore off on me, and after an hour of what felt like forcing myself to play, I just realized I wasn't having fun anymore. I just don't find the concept to be very fun."

6404,2579,"The real baba was in our hearts all along. Unless you rewind, then baba is you again."
6405,2579,"This is some real B I G  B R A I N gameplay here, the music is good also, so if you wanna flex those real muscles in your head this game is a must buy."
6406,2579,Ridiculously fun and there are creative puzzles and stuff and a nice soundtrack
6407,2579,This is a review from someone who kind of really dislikes puzzle games. ...you MUST buy this game. Music: 10/10Art-style10/10 Cuteness: 10/10Secrets!10/10 Fun:10/10
6408,2579,"My brain hurts.One of the hardest puzzle games I've played, yet also somehow the simplest to understand."
6409,2579,"You go in thinking that you're going to be able to mess with stuff, but that's not what the game is about. It is an excellent puzzle game, though, probably one of the best I've tried."
6410,2579,I only have 3 braincells and every time I play this game they are causing a fire in my skull.
6411,2579,AaaAaAAAhhhHHhhh MY bRAin huRTS
6412,2579,great puzzle game with a very unique formula. solving levels feels super satisfying.
6413,2579,"A legit computer scientists dream puzzle. This game teaches you the basics then leaves your brain in agony after getting through the first few worlds. Great concept and design, music is relaxing and I feel accomplished after each level completed especially after it congratulates me :D. Don't think I'll be completing this any time soon after how difficult it's gotten."
6414,2579,"Cleverest and most creative puzzle game I've seen in a long time.  Thoughtful, non-repetitive levels.  Solutions are often out-of-the-box but rarely frustrating.  The base game has a surprisingly large amount of content for the pre-designed puzzle genre, especially considering the lack of repetition.  Highly recommended."
6415,2579,Puzzle game of the year.
6416,2579,"Baba is you and one of the best puzzle games. The puzzles revolve around manipulating the rules of the game. The conceit creates an explosion of surprising patterns, which helps to keep the levels short and witty. There are usually many levels you can try in parallel, so if you get stuck on some, you can work on the others."
6417,2579,"Oh boy, this game.What a fantastic experience this was. I cannot praise it enough. Some of the levels were a bit tough to wrap my head around even watching the solutions, but I was able to get most of them on my own, and a reasonable number with just a hint. Some of the levels were 3000000 IQ, it really makes you feel good to solve them. Don't even get me started on how much I love the last few worlds. If you somehow have avoided spoilers and are interested, please get this game. It is well worth your purchase if you have the patience to think."

6419,2579,"I Firstly try Baba Is You at the Paris Games Week and the first puzzles totally blew my mind.I've relearned to think out of the box and that simple things are the best! Now I assume I am finishing the last levels and I didn't expect the game to be so deep. The deeper I go the more I need to take a brand new sight on the game, play with the words differently to discover how the words are now playing with me.Such a master piece!"
6420,2579,"One of the most innovative and fun puzzle games I've ever played. You can get very stuck in one level but thanks to the way levels are being uncovered you will normally have several levels that you can play.Most levels can be solved in different ways so it's always interesting to compare how you play to others!It is very satisfactory when you complete some levels thinking outside of the box.You will be tempted to look at the solutions on the Internet, please don't, take your time, enjoy, play other levels, come back later and enjoy the challenge.Bought it for 12, at the moment I thought it was a bit expensive but now I think it's worth every cent.BUY IS WIN"
6421,2579,Baba is me and win
6422,2579,The most creative and surprising puzzle game I've ever played. It takes a unique premise and goes above and beyond with. While the difficult puzzles can get frustrating solving them is incredibly rewarding. A true hidden gem!

6434,2578,very fun good puzzles
6435,2578,"I suck at this game so much, but it's a great one nonetheless. The puzzle mechanics are completely unique to any game I've played otherwise, and some levels I've found (maybe all?) can be solved in slightly different ways or orders, which I find generally interesting.Overall, it's a great game with a fun soundtrack, a cozy hand-drawn art style, innovative puzzle mechanics, and a proper amount of challenge for a game designed around being challenging.If you're thinking about getting the game, get it! For those that get frustrated or discouraged quickly, beware that it's not a super easy game!"

6439,2578,It's deep. Just when you feel like you're close to the end you unlock more levels. This game goes on forever and keeps introducing new mechanics.

6445,2577,"An excellent puzzle game about changing rules to win. Contains 200 ""levels"" and 12 ""worlds"", some of which are very hard, and some which are deceptively simple. There are also 3 ""collectibles"". If you truly finish the game, the save file should read as follows:[Flag] [Baba] XX:XX [Clock] 226 [Spore] 12 [Flower] (+3)(Where XX:XX is your total playtime - all other numbers should be as they appear)"
6446,2577,"Full Review --   Curator Site Video Review: https://youtu.be/gOjJ2Vr7AIwBaba is You has gotten a lot of attention recently. Its a new game from Arvi Hempuli Teikari. Its also is a game that scratches that particular itch of mine when I look for puzzle games. Its not just about the rules the game makes, but rather how you deal with them, change them, and make your own rules. This is Baba is You.GraphicsBaba is You is a simple puzzle game, there doesnt appear to be a story, and the graphics as youll see below are a bit plain, however, Baba is You does quite a bit with the simplistic graphics.The titular Baba is a sheep, perhaps. Admittedly, its not always clear what certain objects are, there are three major names that are confusing. Baba Keke and Me. Each refers to a different object that youll eventually recognize through repetition. While one can make guesses of what these objects are, such as sheep, cat, and human, it really doesnt really matter. As long as you know that Baba, is the vague white shape, you have the full knowledge that you need. Each word refers to the same object for the entire game, so theres no confusion with what each word refers to after the first encounter.Itll become clear once we dive into the gameplay, but the name of an object has no power. A Baba, is just an object, as is a wall, a tree, or a rock. As long as the names of objects are clear, Baba is You is able to work efficiently.Some of these names can be confusing but names and objects are presented at the same time, so while there might be some confusion on what a Fungus means, the fact that theres a mushroom on the level make it clear what the player is looking for.But to be honest, the graphics in Baba are serviceable, because they are not very important. Players should have something to look at, and be representative of iconography but the gameplay is where Baba is You exists, if youre coming to look at the game, its in service to that gameplay.Similarly, there is no story with Baba is You, at least nothing beyond Here are some puzzles. Similar to Stephens Sausage Roll, Baby is You doesnt require a story beyond that, this is a pure puzzle game, where even the names of the levels are very minor hints or jokes on the theme of a puzzle.GameplaySo what are the puzzles? Well, Baba is You is unique in that the rules of the game are on the screen at all times and they are the puzzle. If there are three words next to each other forming Baba is You, then the Baba object (the sheepish looking white blob that is in a number of the images) is considered the player.This creates an understanding of how rules work. When words form a sentence, thats considered a rule and usually is implemented immediately. Similarly, if those words are separated, they lose all effect. I say usually because sometimes rules can come into conflict with each other, but thats part of the learning process.Normally I dont refer to my pictures directly but this is a special case. In the screen above, you have four very specific rules.Baba is You The grammar is poor but necessary for the game. Everything is set up to be Object is action or Object. In this case, it simply means the white Baba is controllable. Next to that, we have Flag is Win and thats just telling us in order to beat the level, the flag must be touched. We also have Wall is Stop which means the wall is impenetrable. And finally Rock is Push which simply means rocks are pushable (And impenetrable).So from here, we have four rules. You control Baba, objects cant go through walls, rocks are pushable and touch the flag to win. This is a simple tutorial level where the player just has to push the rock out of the way to win.But thats not the only way. Each word is a pushable object so the player can move Is and Win over to make the Walls the win condition. Suddenly the Walls are the goal. Of course, if they make it so horizontal where Wall is Stop still exists, then both conditions are true. The player cant enter the wall, but the wall is the victory condition. A similar situation can happen with the rocks, as push operates somewhat similar to Stop in that the player cant enter the rock.But a quick push on either Is or Stop/Push and suddenly those walls or rocks are enterable. The player can even get tricky and set up Baba is You and Baba is Win and instantly win, my personal favorite way of beating any level when possible.Theres only one danger on this level. If the player moves any of the words of Baba is You in such a way that nothing is You the level stalls. The music will die down, but essentially, the level ends, and the game tells you to undo or retry again. This might sound strange but from the gameplay its simple. If nothing is you then nothing is controllable and you cant change the scene.Of course with some work, the wall, the rock, or the flag can be you as well. The fact is each rule is malleable and the player has control to make what he wants happens, in fact, thats most of the players agency.The other levels on display here show more complex versions of the game and rules, and these are hardly the only rules in Baba is You. Baba is You is broken up into sections of the game, each with a number of levels, and each section seems to introduce something new, usually in the form of a new word to use. These words can be anything from a rather large list but some of them are Not, On and even Text itself. Each word has a purpose. There are a couple of words late in the game that are some of my favorites, but Ill hold off on sharing them here.Baba is You excels at its level design as almost every section starts rather easily teaching a word, and then grows incrementally more complex. This isnt done through increasing the number of moves but rather the thought process required. In fact, theres no dexterity required as the game only moves after the player makes a move, and most solutions become as simple as realizing the series of moves and then executing them relatively fast. The most complex puzzles probably only require a hundred steps at most, and most will take under 30 seconds to complete once the solution is known.Its the puzzles that allow Baba is You to excel. I found myself amazed at how many times Baba is You could deliver multiple different puzzles in a row using a similar collection of words, and yet each puzzle feels unique.Much of Baba is You though is staring at the puzzle and trying to understand all the elements and the process to succeed. Early on, theres usually more than one way to beat a puzzle, but eventually, puzzles require specific solutions. Though the game is very clever about them.If you want to read more and see a final score, you can see the full review with pictures and video athttps://kinglink-reviews.com/2019/05/25/baba-is-you-review/.

6447,2577,Baba is worth your money.
6448,2577,Literally blew my mind.
6449,2577,"A staggeringly clever masterpiece of a puzzle game that will make you feel like a complete moron, then a genius, then a complete moron again. There are no time constraints, and you can undo your moves as far back as you need to, so it's surprisingly relaxing for a game consisting entirely of seriously difficult, often terrifyingly complex logic puzzles.  It's so tightly designed that there isn't a single puzzle I managed to solve by accident, without understanding exactly how I did it, and there were many, many occasions where my totally brilliant, horribly complicated (but ultimately wrong) solution would have worked if only this one single piece of wall weren't there, or if this moving object were one square ahead or behind at a specific moment, making me acutely aware that the designer had anticipated my every move and planned accordingly.Less because of the nature of the puzzles (although there is some similarity there) and more because of the overall level of difficulty, branching map with themed puzzles, and artfully simple visuals, Baba Is You reminds me most of Andrew Plotkin's System's Twilight.  I have been carrying a torch for that game since the '90s, to the point that I have an emulator set up just to run it and the two other great Mac-exclusive games - so for me to consider a game in the same league as System's Twilight is really high praise.Baba Is You is better than System's Twilight."
6450,2577,Brain is melt
6451,2577,"Brain HurtyMore Specifically it's a game about thinking outside the box, but even when you think outside of the box you have to think your way out of another box to get to that glorious flag, or wall that you made have that little win box"
6452,2577,"This game is very, very good."
6453,2577,Endlessly creative and surprisingly difficult puzzle game. My wife and I love to play this together.
6454,2577,"Very mind-blowing puzzle game as you try every possible means to change the rules in each level for accomplishment. It can be frustrating sometimes (okay maybe more often), as is usually the case for puzzle games, but it won't stop you from enjoying the rest part of it. The game gets more and more abstract (or say meta) as one progresses, and there are always a lot to discover---surprise!As more mechanisms are introduced, their interactions can be rather complicated given that the basic rules are seemingly quite simple, but they can also appear very weird and have some underlying assumptions for the level to work. Personally I'm not very comfortable with these peculiarities, but that can be improved (if I were to develop). It does not affect the whole game experience nevertheless."
6455,2577,"There is nothing wrong with this game. I am just stupid. I will never finish it. I can't help but cheat, which does not allow me to come to my own conclusions. Meaning I don't learn. Meaning I can't easily continue on.Oh well.If you're smart, this game is for you."
6456,2577,A concept that I have never seen before and which is really fun to play. Props to the programmer for creating such a unique and awesome game!

6460,2577,One of the most splendid and original puzzle games I ever played. Masterpierce in it's leauge.
6461,2577,"In many games they claim that you must ""think outside the box"", but in this game... Box Is You."
6462,2577,This game will make your brain explode. Awsome mechanics!
6463,2577,based
6464,2577,"In Baba is You, you find ways to exploit the game mechanics to break and reshape the levels.Except as soon as you figure out how to construct one exploit, Baba introduces a new level which requires you to think about the core mechanics in a totally different way.Halfway through, I can only play a level or two at a time before my brain starts to melt. I love it."
6465,2577,Brain is Fried.
6466,2577,"dear lord, this game is hardbut dear lord, this game is goodif it looks even vaugely interesting to you, pick it up"
6467,2576,Only for people with 2000 Intelligence.
6468,2576,Great game with a great concept. Definitely try it.
6469,2576,"I, a random internet stranger, completed every puzzle in this game, without any hints. Surely you won't let a random internet stranger one-up you, right?More seriously: This game is basically ""Think Outside Of The Box: The Game"". In almost every one of the 226 levels, you're given a box to think your way out of. You start with some nice boxes, moving on to more evil boxes one by one. New mechanics are introduced throughout the game, and the game wastes no time at all forcing you to use them in several utterly unorthodox ways each.The game has a very nonlinear worldmap, so if you get stuck on a few levels you can just go complete some other levels instead, then come back with a fresh outlook and an epiphany waiting for you. You'll definitely be happy about this nonlinearity, because this game, more than any other game, has the unique ability to make you think ""This level is literally impossible"". You don't just get the feeling that it's just very hard and you haven't found the solution yet, you literally think ""Yep, there's absolutely no way this can be done."" You're always wrong, of course. The correct statement would probably be ""Yep, there's absolutely no way this can be done using the techniques I am aware of"". So you need a new technique, a new approach. And guess what: The new approach is always outside the box. Sometimes outside several boxes at once.The game is not unfair. The rules of the game are ridiculously simple. To solve the puzzles, you need to learn to understand them. For each word in the game, you need to understand two things: what the word means, and what the word doesn't mean. The game loves to mess with your preconceptions like that: for example if there's nothing on screen meaning ""LAVA IS HOT"", then lava isn't hot, no matter how intimidating it looks.If you're out of ideas on some level, try to think backwards. What needs to be where for YOU to WIN? What needs to happen to achieve that? Very often, the game wants you to plan ahead and build a certain setup, one you can't just find through trial and error, but one that becomes way more obvious when you think about what needs to have been done.Later on in the game, you'll notice that the game has secretly begun to build more boxes around you while you were playing it. It lulls you in, repeatedly shows you things you'll come to expect, acts like there is an underlying structure to things beyond just the written rules. And then... it just starts subverting your expectations, mercilessly, one by one, without even breaking any of its rules. It's absolutely magnificent to experience, and it's all your own fault for believing there are limits in the first place.The game has an unlimited undo feature, and it's the one feature you'll use most in the game. You will live the undo, breathe it. It is a good feature.Now get to it, buy this game."
6470,2576,Towards the mid game I would get repeatedly stumped and when I looked at the solutions I knew I never would have thought of them which led to me just feeling frustrated and kinda stupid. If you're good at thinking outside the box you will probably have a better time.  Also there are several guides that give hints without giving away the whole solution but the game had already worn me out by the time I found out about them.
6471,2576,Whoever made this will probably develop psychoactive powers and enslave humanity. 11/10
6472,2576,"Baba Is You is an extremely addictive and very challenging puzzle game that's nothing like any other game out there. The fact that the very rules of the level can be changed by moving a few tiles around makes for a game that gets very deep very quickly. I would recommend this to anyone who fancies a mental challenge. In short, BABA IS HARD AND GOOD"
6473,2576,Amazing puzzle game.
6474,2576,"Baba is You is a gem. If you like puzzles that give you brain cramps that require increasingly bizarre NOT IN BOX thinking to solve, this game is 100% worth your money.You'll still get plenty of enjoyment out of it if you hit a wall where nothing makes sense anymore, though, as long as you don't mind that this game actually goes about fifty miles deeper than it looks like it does."

6483,2576,"Baba Is You And GoodOne of the most simple & intuitive, yet brain-wracking puzzle games I've seen in recent memory."
6484,2576,"Absolutely without a doubt one of the most fun, challenging, and unique puzzle games I have ever played. The word swapping mechanic to change how the level works is a fresh idea that works really well. It doesn't get old in the entire course of the game as a bunch of new mechanics are added in every major area. It lets you learn the mechanics well by always giving a level to introduce new mechanics, allowing you to experiment and figure out how it works.While the game does have a large amount of extremely difficult levels, it doesn't really go from easy to hard in its overall progression. Instead, each major area in the game has a mix of easy and hard levels, meaning that you can progress without having to beat every single level in an area. It also means that you can break from a certain puzzle without stopping the game entirely, by simply going to another level or area (at least you can after the first major area).I also don't feel there is any filler; The game demands your attention in order to solve all of the puzzles, and so almost of the time I've played has been proper playtime (almost as some of it was AFK). I haven't yet completed the game fully, and I'm already above 27 hours as of this review. It's well worth the money.Bonus points for being cutesy."
6485,2576,BABA IS ENJOY
6486,2576,"Ever played a puzzle game?This is not it!Ever loved a puzzle game?None like this!Damn this game is addictive, damn this game can be challenging.BUT DAMN IS IT SATISFYING!!!So much Wow."
6487,2575,Baba Is You.Flag Is Win.Game Is Amazing.Brain Is Dead.
6488,2575,Baba is win
6489,2575,"Baba is you is an amazing puzzle game that is not only very fun and innovative, but also extremely complex yet logical at the same time. I love the brilliant game design, and really appreciate the mix of creative thinking and logical deduction required in the puzzle solving process. On top of that, you are continuously introduced to new mechanics and tricks as you progress, which helps keep the game new and engaging. I would highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys puzzle solving.The only thing I can complain about is the background music. While the sound effects are pretty good, the BGM gets a bit annoying for me personally and detracts from the puzzle solving experience, so I usually play my own music over it. I would prefer something that feels more relaxing or zen-like and helps me concentrate."
6490,2575,"An absolute masterpiece of a puzzle game. As someone who drops puzzle games very quickly if they aren't interesting, this one held me over for 50 hours as I cleared every single level (on the Switch version). Even if you don't play puzzle games, absolutely pick this one up. It's expertly crafted from beginning to end.Edited for the 2019 Steam Awards. Lol."
6491,2575,"Baba is You manages to be both brutally difficult and extremely accessible at the same time. In all the right ways, Baba reminds me of the Zachtronics games: from its difficulty curve, playing with logical systems, sandboxiness, and overall feeling of cleverness. As new concepts are introduced, the difficulty dips, before ramping up extremely toward the end of a set of levels to demonstrate your mastery of said concept. Thankfully you don't need to have completed every level of a set in order to progress, so you can flit back and forth between levels to try and learn new tricks that will help you with the harder levels that you found yourself stuck on before.For me, the sign of an excellent puzzle game is one that allows you to get stuck because you need to change your way of thinking. Baba is extremely successful on this front, as its entire premise is shifting the rules of the game, and by extension the way you interact with it. I'm nowhere near done with the game, but I've already had to walk away from it a couple of times to let solutions for the set of levels I'm on gestate in my subconscious. Coming back with a fresh perspective and hitting that ""A-ha!"" moment is the best feeling in a puzzle game, and Baba is just stuffed to the brim with such moments.I cannot recommend Baba enough. Just remember: if you get stuck, walk away, you probably need to come back with a fresh perspective to solve the level(s) you're on."
6492,2575,"Absolute magnificence. One of the best puzzle games I've played, right up there with the Portals.The extremely simple yet absurdly creative system is very fun to work with, and has so many options for interesting puzzle design that it can have a couple hundred levels and EVERY SINGLE ONE introduces some kind of wacky new idea, which all-too-frequently blows my  mind. And it doesn't even have to pile on tons of new mechanics to do this. And even after the novelty of being able to do LITERALLY ANYTHING YOU CAN THINK OF wears off you're left with a well-executed, challenging and engaging puzzle game which respects the player's intelligence. No annoying tutorials here, and this is no easy game. But it doesn't throw stuff at you which you don't have the means to figure out, and you don't have to beat every level to progress so it never feels punishing.Visuals and audio aren't stellar like the gameplay but they get the job done.I cannot stress enough how often this game had me saying ""HOLY HELL I CAN (insert hilarious emergent gameplay feature)"". If you're even the tiniest bit interested in puzzle games I'm convinced you will find value in Baba Is You."
6493,2575,"One of the best puzzle games I have ever played.  Worth the first few hours of kind of standard feeling gameplay to get to the mind bending meta fun that comes later.Suffers from a slower start, and while most of the puzzles utilize the amazing core gimmick, a few are pretty much movement puzzles that feel like that traffic jam game with the red car.  Did not love those.9/10, only puzzle game that has ever held my interest for so long or had me 100% it and be sad."
6494,2575,"A clever and difficult puzzle game. For anyone worried about the price tag, it has ~200 levels, and most of them you're going to spend hours on trying to figure out."
6495,2575,It's good.
6496,2575,"This is possibly one of the most challenging puzzle games to date. I love the charming aesthetic, I love the perfectly soothing music, I love the general concept of it all. Its a perfect game to play while listening to anything in the background. There were a few times I had to look up hints after being stuck for over an hour, but its still a game worthy of anyone's time.Baba is Good."
6497,2575,I thought I was smart after beating the tutorial but now my brain hurts. Incredibly clever puzzle design. 10/10
6498,2575,"Some might say it's a little too early, but i think i found my Game of the Year."
6499,2575,"Baba is you is incredibly crafted.  As a guy who enjoys a good hearty puzzle game (but is not particularly good at them), Baba Is You offers excellent challenge but also excellent pacing.  New puzzles are unlocked with relatively few roadblocks and all solutions seem ""fair"" in the mix of complicated rules/complications. A surprising number of levels have multiple solutions, and there are a lot variation/bonus levels that give opportunities for expert players to explore the depths of the rules.The ways the game keep surprising me is amazing, and talking about them in this review would ruin some of the surprises, but they are worth it!"
6500,2575,Extremely original and good game
6501,2575,"One of the best puzzle games I have ever played! The Mechanics are simple, but the level design is amazing, making each level more challenger than the previous one."
6502,2575,BABAisTHEBEST!
6503,2575,"It'll be hard to say something that hasn't been said, so I'll try not to ramble on. BABA IS GOOD.The game starts simple, teaching you to try whatever crazy ideas come to mind, and then throws you into the deep end with a sheep and a treadmill and tells you to somehow build a boat. After a while, just about every puzzle's solution leaves you thinking ""what the fresh hell was that."" I say this as lovingly as possible. If you're the type to insist on never looking up hints, you'll get hours and hours and hours out of this game. If you're the type who does look up hints...you'll probably still get hours and hours out of this. Fifteen bucks is the perfect price, and as an aspiring game designer I have a lot of respect for the people who made this adorable and unique puzzler. Also, I haven't finished it all the way through, but I'm starting to get the feeling there's something interesting going on on the map screen...PROS: All of the above and what you see in other reviews. CONS: Not the kind of game you'll want to sit down and play for several consecutive hours. It's a lot better to play until you get tired, and then leave it alone for the day."

6506,2575,Most interesting puzzle I've ever played. The solutions are often simple but not obvious.
6507,2575,"Basically, in this game you define rules by moving words and obejcts back and forth and these rules are applied to the level. For example ""Baba is you"" means, that you control the character Baba. ""Flag is you"" in turn causes you to control a flag. ""Flag is Key"" turns all flags into keys and so on... A game mechanic that I have never seen before in this form, which makes it hard to name comparable games here.This game is the most ""bugged"" game I have ever played. For many of the later levels there is simply no solution. The only workaround is to search for the level in the background on Youtube and watch the video. Then suddenly your own game does what it's supposed to as well ...Seriously, many of the levels are really, really difficult. It makes you feel really stupid to watch a solution video after 3 days. Often you have the thought that you probably wouldn't have found the solution in 100 years on your own. But the moments in which you suddenly come up with the solution on your own are simply terrific.So, if you keep in mind that you are not necessarily as stupid as some of the levels make you feel, the game is enjoyable and as it is also very unique, I recommend you to try it as well."

6511,2574,"The best sokoban I've ever played. It's charming, inventive and just never stops surprising you. Baba is great."
6512,2574,"Genius! What ""Portal"" did for my perception of space and impulse, ""Baba is you"" does for my perception of being and logical connections."
6513,2574,"One of the most innovative puzzle games in years. Levels can be tricky, (especially Extra levels), but solving them is always satisfying. My only complaint is that a non-trivial subset of levels basically devolve into Sokoban, where it's clear what you need to do, you just need to line up the various blocks properly, which is always tedious (particularly levels where you need to control multiple characters to push things at the same time). The best levels are ones that fully utilize the core mechanic, manipulating the rules to turn obstacles into assets."
6514,2574,Nice Game. Such Puzzle. Wow. Very Hard. Wow. Much Recommend.
6515,2574,Supah hard :(
6516,2574,"VERY good and yummy game, it continued to blow my mind with how clever it was all the way up to the end. It's got a similar appeal to Stephen's Sausage Roll in that it fleshes out its mechanics very well, but it has a smoother difficulty curve (albeit reaching the same heights of difficulty) and a wider variety of puzzle-solving gimmicks to work with. Anybody with even a mild interest in puzzle games should play this"
6517,2574,"Puzzle games are hit and miss for me. This is a huge hit. Some levels break my brain but I refuse to look for solutions online because it's that rewarding to solve the hardest levels. You can skip many levels and come back to them later, allowing you to continue to get better before going back for levels that caught you up earlier. Best puzzle game since the Portal series."
6518,2574,One of the most unique puzzle games I have ever played. Baba is you. Baba is 10/10
6519,2574,Brain is melt
6520,2574,"If you are worried about the price and who like puzzle games like me, you won't regret.The amount of puzzle is quite a lot in this game. Also they have very unique answers.Finally, Baba is so cute. :D"
6521,2574,Baba is Genius
6522,2574,Game IS Good AND Hard
6523,2574,"One of the best, if not the best puzzle game.Only lack a level editor, and a worshop to share and rate these levels."
6524,2574,"First impression review after 70 minutes in:Concept and idea: 10/10 Gameplay 9/10: Feels very fresh, already addictedGraphics: 7/10 Very fitting, but nothing extraordinaryMusic and sound: 7/10Conclusion: Baba is WinOverall: 8/10"
6525,2574,Such a great game if you like puzzles!
6526,2574,"Let me preface this by saying this is a good game. Great, even. I loved the gimmick of this entire game and how it presented itself (graphically and musically). It's easy to pick up and play... but it's not easy to figure out most of those puzzles.I picked this up via word of mouth from a friend, thinking it'd be challenging but fair -- something like the Portal games, which I really enjoyed playing through. That held true for the first few levels, but then it just... skyrocketed in difficulty and complexity.I can only recommend the game to hardcore puzzle fans who REALLY want a challenge. I had to use a walk-through to get thorough most of the puzzles later in the game,  and... it didn't feel good. Either I had a moment of ""OH, I'm dumb!"", or a moment of ""How could anyone figure that out?"". The puzzles I DID figure out myself felt great - it's very reminiscent of the feeling you have in old retro games, where you have a really hard time with a stage, but when you get through you just forget it. Of course it's not the same here, but the feeling is similar.I see the appeal of this game, hence why I said it's a great game! Again, I really love how this game looks and how it sounds - the music is a perfect fit for the type of game, something chill and relaxing, helping dissipate some of the frustration you'll face with some of the puzzles... However, as it is right now, I can't recommend it unless you're a hardcore fan of this genre. Personally, I gave up after realising I couldn't solve ANY of the puzzles, in any of the worlds without a walk-through."
6527,2574,"It's rare that I watch the video for a game and find myself giggling with glee at the base mechanic. Logic puzzles usually require you to make use of what there is, to change what there is, within the rules of what is. Here you change the rules of what is, turning the whole thing on its head. Bend your mind whilst altering reality! Highly recommended."
6528,2574,Good game
6529,2574,"I like the game at its core. It's charming and accessible and Baba is a cute character. But this game is egregiously difficult. By far the hardest puzzle game I have ever played and I'm not even at the end of the game. There are so many new keywords and tricks to learn that it's hard to keep up with, and the syntax seems inconsistent at times. I think it's a good game, but I absolutely cannot recommend it unless you can get it for free or you have found every puzzle game you have played to be too easy.Another chief complaint is that when you start playing the game, it gives you a world of options. It lures you in with as many solutions as your creativity can muster up. That ends quickly. After an hour in the game at the most, the puzzles stifle creativity wherever possible and make absolutely sure that there's only one possible solution to most puzzles. So not only is the difficulty naturally ramping up, but it also artificially increases by telling you that your innovative and fun solutions aren't acceptable."
6530,2574,absolutely infuriating. 10/10 anni is best
6531,2574,I must say the game is super hard but it is so satisfying when you find a  solution to a stage where you didnt even see the potential of a possible answere. Possibly the best puzzle game i ever played.
6532,2574,"Baba is you,but is you Baba?"
6533,2574,Chip's Challenge with programming logic. Good stuff.
6534,2574,*my brain stopped working*have you tried turning it off and on again?absolutely 10/10 best puzzle game of all time
6535,2573,"A fresh mind-blowing simple indie puzzle game. This game is a piece of art and a unique jewel. It has a nice learning curve, offer various incredible ""think out-of-the-box"" style challenges. Many levels will still be accessible even if you get stuck at a particular one, and the game is not punitive : you can cancel any of your moves whenever you want, not forced to start again from the initial setup.The crude graphics still create a very to-the-point atmosphere. The music participates nicely to this feeling, though it could be a bit repetitive at some points, which is frankly the only ""not-so-perfect"" point that I could find to write here.This is by far the best puzzle-game I ever played, completely different from the one I know.Try it, buy it. Alone or with friends, you won't be disappointed if you like games that surprise you / make you think differently."
6536,2573,I've decided that I am too dumb to play this game.About half way through it gets harder than The Witness. I'm not kidding you. I've spent hours just looking at a level. And I don't regret it.
6537,2573,both my mind and my grammar are being destroyed but it's a fun way to go
6538,2573,"A puzzle game with an interesting mechanic that allows for lots of fun interactions: being able to entirely change the properties of objects.Early stages are fun to experiment with as there are many solutions and finding the most ridiculous one is an enjoyable way to explore the limits of what you are capable of doing.As you progress, however, this game does not relent in its difficulty. Baba Is You features great level design that will force you to try everything you can think of. Thankfully, the game's ""undo"" button is an excellent control that allows you to to quickly and precisely test any of your ideas step-by-step.Of course, you are not expected to complete every single stage. Completing a fraction of the stages in an area will unlock the next one, and you will still find that there are a great number of stages to play. Those who are looking for a real brain-ache can attempt more stages. Baba Is You is easily one of the most difficult puzzle games I've played. If you're looking for a challenge, you will surely be satisfied."
6539,2573,"Clever and cute, with puzzles that range in difficulty from wonderfully easy yet creative, to mind-bendingly hard."
6540,2573,head has poo
6541,2573,"Yes you have tried logic, but have you tried breaking the game? well it was intended and this is the only way you can actually continue.superb game, srsly. 10/10"
6542,2573,brain is hurt
6543,2573,Baba is Hot
6544,2573,"Great game, makes you really think outside the box to complete levels. I like when games go meta and this one in particular not only surprised me with the presence of my beloved topic, but also delivered a surprising amount of content on it as well! Well worth the price and time spent. Additional cheers for making the game achievements just about solving every puzzle."
6545,2573,"Great puzzle. Worked well for us in a family setting. My 8-year old thoroughly enjoyed it and kept talking about it after we've finished the initial playthrough. I was slightly concirned about the artstyle and it not being ""pretty"" but it looks better live because of animations."
6546,2573,Baba Is You is one of the best games I have ever played. The puzzles are creative and get gradually harder in such a way that every one is doable but a challenge. I have never left a review for a game before but this one was worth it. A fantastic logic game.
6547,2573,"I don't usually leave reviews for games, but I've just been having such a good time playing Baba Is You. If the trailer and concept seems appealing to you, this is definitely something you should pick up. The soundtrack is pretty, the visuals are adorable and simple, which complement the game really well!! I am really happy with the cute aesthetic they gave this game, it makes all the puzzles really nice to look at. The puzzle/level design is also always very fun, every time you get to the next level there's a whole lot more to unpack. It's really satisfying when you finally see the congratulations screen after trying some insane solution that you weren't sure would work. The game executes what it promises to give you perfectly. This is probably my favorite puzzle game of all time. Super super fun."
6548,2573,"I saw this game at a friends house saturday evening. It's now sunday night (early monday morning really) and I've already sunk quite a lot of hours into it. It's really addictive. There are times when you'll scratch your head and wonder how on earth a particular puzzle is possible, but as long as you keep on trying out new things it will work out in the end. One of the very best puzzlers out there."
6549,2573,"Just 100% completed Baba is You, and I feel comfortable saying this is a very good sokoban-style puzzle game. There is an enormous amount of content in this game, and for me and everyone I have talked with about the game, many of these puzzles take over an hour, sometimes up to 3 hours. There are some extremely clever smart puzzles, but also a few ones which feel a little unfair. It's unclear when a puzzle is trying to teach you a new mechanic, or whether you are supposed to just be using what you already know. The developer is actively patching the game and addressing these issues, so for me and numerous friends puzzles change between sessions as we are working on them due to these adjustments. There are definitely moments where after an hour of fiddling you find a new way the words can be used and it feels like these teaching levels should be much more limited to guide the player into learning the mechanic. They often have red herrings and many options which seem plausible but are incorrect. Many of the mechanics interact in unintuitive or quirky ways (namely Shift and Swap), and there are a bunch of rules in place that are unwritten (mostly around the words Text and Level). You just need to fumble your way through understanding these quirks and memorize them. Even with all those negative points, the number of really brilliant fair puzzles more than make up for them. This game is absolutely worth playing if you like puzzle games."
6550,2573,"This game brainwashed me. Now I go about my day and my mind is like ""baba is you, you is baba, rock is baba you is move is baba stop is jelly baba stop is you ... ect"""
6551,2573,"This is as close to perfect as a game can be. To be honest, it's nothing but just a bunch of arenas where you push things around. Yet, such a simple concept can be be turned to such a challenging and creative game, is hard to imagine until you play it. It's super fun but super-er hard."
6552,2573,"This is the work of a genius! A masterpiece! Highly recommended and a must-have if you like puzzles and problems that are incredibly difficult to solve. Definitely not a 'shooty-shooty-pew-pew-do-this-and-do-that-and-you-win' game and does require a heck of a lot of patience and time. Starts very easy but gets deadly hard quickly. There are times when you will feel like some problems are absolutely impossible to solve. And that's where lies the fun!Rumour has it that a level editor is coming soon, and the community is already making extra levels so that's definitely a good thing. Love the soundtrack. Doesn't require a lot of CPU and GPU resource so it's possible for me to keep it running in the background and play during those hour-long trips in flight sims. If you are bored and would like to throw a bunch of very difficult challenges to throw at your brain from time to time, buy it. At around $15 dollars (11.39 in UK) the price is affordable too."
6553,2573,"A cute, simple game at first, which gets genuinely complex over time.The puzzles are split into themed sections.Each section uses a bit different color scheme and introduces a new mechanic, on which it builds upon, until it gets really hard to solve.You don't have to do all puzzles though. You unlock 1-3 levels per solved puzzle, and you ""complete"" a section after you have finished 60-70% of it.If you like logic/puzzle games, there is a lot of content here to enjoy.Just remember to take breaks and don't be too hard on yourself.Recommended."
6554,2573,Highly recommended for anyone really. Useful introduction to logic & programming too.

6560,2572,"Game is good, Baba is hot, music is nice, brain is melt"
6561,2572,"What a wonderful game. It's rules are incredibly simple...but, that also means that they are easily mixed and matched and implemented in all sorts of combinations and manners of ways. Not to mention, it does the good game tutorial thing, where rather than telling you what to do, it just shows you what to do and leaves you to figure out the simple steps and then builds upon that. I can't remember the last time I've had such an emotional rollercoaster of an experience of feeling like a genius then like an utter idiot and so on. There are a few weirdnesses that may take a bit to figure out (e.g. Open doesn't just open things, but touches Close and has them both destroy each other), but once you understand the game's vocabulary, it's amazing how brilliant of an experience it ends up feeling to be."
6562,2572,"It never ends. You think you're at the end, but it's not the end, it's never the end.The end is always further than the end you've reached, but that's not the end either.Why won't it end?IT NEVER ENDSHELP ME"
6563,2572,Great concept! Great implementation! ... very addictive! - Well done Sir!
6564,2572,"Too difficult too quickly. Felt like I was dealing with advanced concepts once I hit around level 10, and the game felt too much like a mobile game. Also, some gameplay mechanics felt random and unintuitive. Why can I not move the actual rock into the rule, and only the word ""rock""?"
6565,2572,"It's all fun and games until you forget how to breathe from keeping track of all the things in the Garden, boil your brain to the point where you become a lobotomite in Meta and then get depressed and commit suicide after the true ending."
6566,2572,BABA IS YOUYOU ARE NOT SMART ASS
6567,2572,10/10 made me want to die
6568,2572,this game is one of the most ambitious and difficult puzzle games I've played. I believe there are some unfair puzzles because of certain strange interactions that I feel the players should have learned in a tutorial level but there is still logic to the answers. I've only finished most of the game's content but even that was still a lot.
6569,2572,GA    IS    HAME           RD
6570,2572,"A charming and addictive game.  Sometimes the levels are too rigid, preventing alternative solutions... which seems to be in direct conflict with the game's design philosophy, honestly.  I'll think I've come up with something really clever, only to find a lingering ""Skull is Sink has Wall"" that renders my solution impossible.  I wish the developers hadn't walled off (both literally and figuratively) many levels in this fashion.Levels with the rule ""Empty"" were the hardest, at least for me.  Also, the ones that require 'tile ballet', where multiple Babas must be moved in a very specific manner, weren't very fun.  I prefer the ones were you change the rules to solve the puzzles.The wiggle effect causes eye strain: if you have any vision problems (even minor) I recommend disabling it in the settings.Anyway, the game is definitely worth your time if you like puzzles.  You always have the option to set a level aside and come back to it later; I recommend doing so whenever you encounter an unnumbered, so that you can learn new tricks before facing a puzzle you can't solve.  You may even need to abandon whole zones until you've completed other areas, but don't give up!"
6571,2572,One of the best puzzle games ever made.What makes the game great - its simple and beautiful difficulty - will make some people angry though.

6575,2572,"Previously, I had qualms about the near constant level changes during the first 6 months following release. Now that game has had time to mature I've been enjoying it once again. I highly recommend if you're into puzzle games to take a look at this. This game was robbed of most innovative game of year award for the 2019 Steam Awards."
6576,2572,"An astonishing triumph of game design. Everything is driven by the core mechanic, which is one of the most innovative and novel systems I have ever seen in game software."
6577,2572,"Probably my favorite puzzle game ever. Its unique and brilliant logic is just... whatever, there are tons of reviews that explain why it's so good. It just is."
6578,2572,"Some of the logic on the puzzles was inconsistent is my only real complaint(some of the rules did not work on some levels). Fun challenging game tho, but it was a deal breaker and a refund based on that."
6579,2572,"This game is fun, though I suck at it.This is one of the more unique puzzle games out there, like in most puzzle games I've played, the rules don't change. A specific entity does a specific action, and you have a list of moves you can do. However in this game, the rules are defined by the level. You can interact with the text defining the rules, but they also interact with the world. (e.g. an entity could walk into a a rule and change it)The level format is pretty standard, however at the start it's easy, but the difficulty increases fast. It doesn't have a steep learning curve, it's just the difficulty increases. It isn't necessarily bad. The first few levels you'll be able to get in one sitting, but then in your next few plays it'll be it bit harder to progress.It's nice to play this game it's nice to do a 'Slow Burn'. Beat 2 or 3 levels each try. And also, if you're stuck on a level for a long time, don't feel bad to look up walkthroughs. Like seriously, you'll need those.9/10 - Would Brain is Hurt again"
6580,2572,"I first played this a few years ago as a game jam demo, and was pleasantly surprised to find it now fleshed out into a full game. Baba is You is almost hands down the most clever puzzle game I've ever played. So many of the solutions are incredibly clever, but at the same time very simple. ""Thinking outside the box"" may be a cliche, but this game absolutely personifies that phrase. The difficulty is fine for the most part; it's not as brutally punishing as say, Stephen's Sausage Roll, Space Chem, or TIS-100. Particularly since you're able to select from multiple levels at one time in a world, and you only have to beat a little over half of them to move on to the next world, so if you're stuck on a level you can just try a different one. The end game however, gets *incredibly* meta and brutally hard, and I fully admit to having to look up much of it in a guide. It's still really fun and very much worth playing through.Baba Is You joins The Talos Principle and Portal 2 as one of my favorite puzzle games of all time."
6581,2572,"Wonderful game, absolutely worth picking up and if I recall correctly there's going to be a Level Editor coming up soon, so there's some replayability there."
6582,2572,"Anybody who writes a negative review either wants to hate the game just cause, or hates puzzle games and this isn't for them. This game almost punishes you for overthinking."
6583,2572,"Baba is You is a brilliant little Sokoban-style puzzle game where you quite literally have to break the rules to solve its puzzles, with tons of increasingly-creative solutions and ""Eureka!"" moments. After completing the game 100%, I can definitely say it's one of my new favourite games on Steam.Highly recommended for puzzle fans.BABA is WINisBEST"
6584,2572,Great concept.
6585,2572,"Creativity and great execution of this game is astounding - I cannot believe it isn't much more popular than it is.I am hyped for this game as much as I am for Sekiro - and I waited for Sekiro for whole year, while Baba is you was found by me more or less randomly few days ago.If you any remotely like puzzle/logic games, you are about to have great time."
6586,2572,Great fun Game with difficult Puzzles that make you think a lot.Recommended :D
6587,2572,"Brilliant puzzle game, pretty tricky but not too frustrating at this point, can't get over the cuteness of Baba and his friends."
6588,2572,This is the best puzzle game I've played in a VERY long time.
6589,2572,"Many hours of content, very creative and challenging"
6590,2572,"Pro:Baba is Win!Con:You is feeling dumbMaybe too early to call it, but  it; best puzzle game of 2019!"
6591,2572,"Hands down the best puzzle game I ever player (yes I like the PUZZLES even better than portal 2). This game is super creative and well designed and I find the difficulty just right to be challenging but not frustrating :) I know most people will find this game prob pretty hard in the later levels but even without them the game is great and you don't have to finish all of them to progress in the game! (Though every single one is great, I finished them all)."
6592,2572,Far beyond my brain to comprehend but I'm glad it exists.
6593,2572,"I've played computer games for quite a while, but this is really something new. Highly recommended."
6594,2571,best puzzle game there is tbh
6595,2571,Real gem of a puzzle game. Definitely one of the best I have ever played. Added bonus of sounding insane when talking yourself though a puzzle.
6596,2571,"This game is absolutely incredible! At first I was worried having the rules of the level being malleable would make it a tad easy, but rest assured that is wholly not the case. This game is tough as nails, though (once you understand the rules of the game) is completely fair! It's also stuffed full of content that never repeats itself; all the levels and areas feel extremely unique! Also, the game still retains its cutesy charm after staring at it for over 24 hours, which is very impressive. BABA IS GOOD. So good."

6603,2571,"So, I finally completed the entirety of the game.The game is very unique and interesting with more than 200 puzzles, but some of them are HARD. I see myself as an expert when it comes to solving puzzles, but there were still a bunch of them that took me more than an hour to solve and that appeared to be impossible.If you like REALLY REALLY hard puzzles like me, then this is definitely something for you.If you just want to solve puzzles easy and quickly, then you may enjoy most levels, but many other ones in this game will overstrain you and take too long for you too solve.I'm giving this game a positive review, because of it's very unique style and because making such an amount of incredibly difficult puzzles is also a difficult task and not something you will see very often."
6604,2571,"Baba is You challenges you to think outside the box, then take that box and use it to think outside reality.On the surface, it's a super simple block pushing game where certain block arrangements have neat little effects. But once you peel back the cutesy veneer, you discover that the blocks actually form a declarative programming language that alters every single aspect of the rules, and reality.From almost the word 'go', you'll be transforming walls into sheep, making lava fly, creating duplicates of yourself to turn into rocks, and pushing the void. The act of simply discovering all of the ridiculous reality alterations you can do and how those fit neatly into clever puzzles is so satisfying and compelling that you tend to always want to do more after you've just finished a batch of them. And there is always more. Way, way more. Over 200 puzzles total, to be precise. And they keep throwing new things in so it doesn't ever get stale.That said, that length also ends up being somewhat of a drawback. The hardest puzzles are tough. Really, really tough. You'll be spending hours on them. As such, I recommend putting this game down when you have other mentally-demanding tasks to do, because the multiple dozens of hours of brainwracking it puts you through can legitimately give you a headache if you're not careful."
6605,2571,BABA IS WIN
6606,2571,Love this game.It makes me think out of the box.
6607,2571,~50 levels into the game. Loving it a lot! Truly outstanding game!
6608,2571,"This quickly became one of my all-time favorite games. An astounding wealth of gameplay, with difficulties ranging from trivial to nigh impossible. The perfect balance of simple core mechanics in endlessly complex combinations.The graphics are actually a huge strength. Simplifying the look and feel gives the developer a lot more freedom to push the limits of the gameplay, and gives the player a reliable context. Almost any level can be solved simply from a screenshot.If you enjoyed Portal or any other similar puzzle game, you'll be both charmed and thrilled by Baba Is You."
6609,2571,"Just a fantastic puzzle game from start to finish. If you watch two minutes of the game or the trailer and think it looks fun, then you will certainly get dozens of hours of enjoyment (and occasional frustration) out of this game."
6610,2571,Baba is YouGame is Hard and Good
6611,2571,"Baba is You is not really a sokoban game. Expecting something like Kickle Cubicle is not going to happen here, On the other hand it is a game of simple grammatical relationships similar to the puzzle games found in zachtronics releases, but somehow more pleasant and pulled off with a twist of the sentence that makes it memorable. Baba is You is exactly the weirdness of baby talk blended with so many good ideas and so many fun plays on the possibility of it's grammar that it becomes really something special. It's a little indie gem that made me smile and also managed to make me think in ways I had not before. If you love this genre this is a good reward."
6612,2571,"This game makes you feel like a genius sometimes. Other times, you will wonder how you ever made it this far in life. It's not extremely complicated or complex, but isn't easy by any means. The solutions will usually be in front of your eyes, and most of the times you will figure out each of the pieces, and all you have to do is apply the mechanics of the game. That being said, I breezed through a lot of the game until I hit this one particular level. I spent one hour coming up with idea's and complex idea's that were not supported by the mechanics of the game, thus weren't possible solutions. I tried so many combinations, and I felt like I was so close every time, yet I got thwarted back from the end screen. I took a little break and it hit me, that all this time that I spent thinking about these other solutions, I skipped over a much easier solution. An hour in a puzzle game is not the same as in other games. It's an hour that your brain is working hard. An hour that you are being frustrated by failure. An hour that kicks you straight in the balls for messing up. So, when I finally returned to the game, to find such an easy solution, I decided that I needed to recommend this game. Because so many puzzle games sometimes feel unfair, or makes the player feel cheated. Not this one, this one just slaps you in the face by showing you a mirror of how dumb you are. It's a good feeling that you'll remember for a while and it brands the game with a unique aura, for having some many levels that are sooo easy, but still make you feel like a genius because of how clever they are."
6613,2571,"Love this game, love the style, the music, and I particularly love the mechanics. It's a great puzzle game that will very much test your critical thinking skills.However, I do have two problems with the game. Firstly, this game has wildly varying difficulty in some places, one level might be very easy, the other would keep you up for days trying to figure it out. While almost every level early on is relatively simple in practice, the difficulty curve spikes pretty early on.Secondly, this game is updated way too much. Since it's release, it's received updates every 1-3 days, and these updates aren't just bugfixes or minor changes, some of them change entire levels or the order of these levels. This renders a lot of solutions are that are already online completely obsolete and creates a differing experience between you and other people.I do recommend the game, but be aware that the game is both extremely hard, and updated with major changes very frequently."
6614,2571,this game pleases my girlfriend more than i probably ever could.thank you!? i guess?!...
6615,2571,"Good soundtrack, cute art style and some of the most fiendish puzzles imaginable.BIY is a severely good game that will absolutely destroy your brain. Somewhere out there, theoretically, is someone who's beaten every single level without a hint, and they're some sort of godlike being who could enlighten and uplift all of Earth's societies.Instead they're playing puzzle games."
6616,2571,"For the longest time, puzzle games have had to meet certain criteria to be enjoyable experiences. Entries in the genre had to straddle a paper-thin line between too easy and too hard. Games that are too easy can insult the player's intelligence, while games that are too hard achieve their difficulty through frustratingly arbitrary riddles or needless complexity that makes you bust out the ol' pen and paper and doesn't lend itself to fun very well.I picked up this game about two weeks ago and didn't stop playing until I had achieved 100%. Baba is like no puzzle game I've ever seen before because it takes this preconceived line that a good puzzle game has to balance on and throws it in the trash. Perfect difficulty curve aside, every puzzle gradually introduces a fresh idea to discover without always introducing a new mechanic. The core principle of the game is introduced immediately and the little quirks of the engine have a myriad of applications, all of which you will learn to exploit to your advantage. (EDIT: I was never as glad to be so wrong. It is of course not ""all"". It had the foresight to save some of the most absurd leaps of logic for custom levels.) The sky is the limit with the solution to a Baba puzzle. The game never hand-holds, never insults your intelligence, and never uses any solution you can't figure out from a VERY close and deep look at the problem. Rest assured you will be entertained if you stick with it. This game is cool as balls but not for impatient people. The most mind imploding parts of Baba is You are in places that 0.1% of players will reach without a guide. Keep in mind that the game STARTS with playing sokoban with the game rules, and just gets better from there...14/10 best game of all time (for me personally), undoubtedly best puzzle game of all time looking only at the puzzles themselves."
6617,2571,This game makes my brain hurt very mucho
6618,2571,"The average Baba Is You level is deliciously obviously impossible. Baba's puzzles are not hard because they have a thousand different things to try. They are hard because they have 2 things to try, both of which obviously cannot work.Which makes the ""Aha!"" moments -- ""Oh! You just do this!!"" -- so sweet.This game has so many new ideas. There is no filler."
6619,2571,Brilliant game for not so brilliant players.
6620,2571,My head hurts playing this game.
6621,2571,by area 2 you can see that the real gimmick is what you cant interact with instead of what you can do
6622,2571,BABA IS YOUBRAIN IS MELT
6623,2571,GAME OF THE YEAR!!!!!!!!!
6624,2571,"The smartest, most creative, most original, most adorable, and most mind-bending puzzle game I've ever played. If you want my advice, never look up the answers, or even take hints, you'll feel like a genius once you finally figure out the hardest puzzles. There's tons of levels that all feel finely-crafted, and the hardest puzzles require not only your understanding of how the commands function with each other, but how the commands themselves (and you) interact with the world (and you). A very, VERY smart game. The only thing that'd make it for me is if it had a level creator, and it seems like it'd fit right in given how modular the game seems in its construction. I highly recommend Baba Is You to anyone looking for the best and most original puzzle game since Portal 2."
6625,2571,"When I started playing this game, I knew something was up, but I stuck with it and didn't refund it.Now I 100%'ed it and honestly, it's not good.90% of this game is anything but ""Baba Is You"". It's full of mini-games or Sokoban with extra steps. Only in the 10% of the playtime are you actually figuring out the mechanics of the game.The pacing of the levels (assuming you play them in numerical order) are all over the place, tutorial levels barely explain new mechanics and some levels are completely out of place, either being too hard/not in the area's theme or being too easy/time wasting. It really feels like the dev just found some quirks with it's game mechanics and just sprinkled them out  trough the levels with 0 thought put in.Far too often you come into a level just to be met with a CVS receipt of already set rules that you can't change. Then you have to mentally exhaust each and every interaction you can think of and then pat yourself on the back for finding the solution.The ~200 levels is both too much and too little. After completion I felt like I still don't have an intuitive understanding of many mechanics and also that I wasted quite a bit of time solving levels that nether were hard nor thought me anything about the game.Nothing felt intuitive, nothing felt smart and not a single level made me say ""aha!"".Lastly, an open letter to the developer: Why the  are you changing levels post-release?"
6626,2571,"Fantastic pure puzzle game. The design is both simple and ingenious- you construct and change rules from the text blocks on screen in order alter each puzzle to make it winnable. No reflexes, no aiming, just you and your brain versus a clear system of rules for you to figure out. There is quite a lot of content, and it does get pretty difficult. There's even a level editor. You get a lot of value for such a cheap indie game. Highly recommended."
6627,2571,"This is the perfect puzzle game, it encapsulates everything the genre should be"
6628,2571,i like this game and we share the same name so that's pre cool
6629,2571,"Really makes you think differently to solve each puzzle. Frustrating at times, but there's always that ""aha"" moment when the solution clicks. Also, not sure why, but I've grown really attached to Baba and co over the course of playing this. Plays like a warm toasty cup of soup on a rainy day.Fair warning though, if you're the kind of person who thinks they have a solution and *must* try to make it work, this game's puzzles aren't for you."
6630,2571,"It's a wonder why people aren't raving about this game more. What a unique and innovative concept, designed by a brilliant mind, to be both intriguing and infuriating. Not only is it a great concept, but it is implemented fantastically, with so many levels that you are sure to get hours out of this game. All the puzzles are intriguing; some are manageable in the first few tries, others still elude me. The level system seems perfectly balanced so you'll never be truly stuck on one problem with nowhere else to go, but it still requires you to solve a decent number of puzzles to progress. Everything else about the game is simple and wonderfully built, so you can focus completely on solving the puzzles and exploring this ingenious system.On the technical side, I am so pleased by how the game works. It's available on Mac, it loads in an instant, and it barely takes up any of my (dwindling) disk space. I feel I can open it, play it for an hour, and tear myself away - knowing I can easily come back to it at any time. I'm so glad the creator has taken the time to code this so it runs so smoothly and efficiently.What a truly fantastic game, and well worth the asking price. Don't be fooled by the simple graphics - this game is as elegant and challenging as it gets."
6631,2571,"I don't write many Steam reviews, and I don't like giving negative reviews in general. However, this is a game I can't recommend to anyone. The concept is neat, but most of the levels aren't any fun. The first couple dozen are good, and then after that it just becomes incredibly tedious. The majority of them have only a single solution, and the developer has even gone through to explicitly remove unintended ones. So when you solve a level you don't feel particularly creative, you just feel like you pushed objects around in the precise way the developer wanted you to.On top of this, a lot of levels are incredibly frustrating in that you have to do a series of multiple unintuitive things to solve them which means that even if you think you know part of the solution you still have to fight with the game in order to execute it and move on. This also makes it nearly impossible to play in tandem with another person because, unless that person was playing the game every moment with you or also playing on their own, they would never have enough information to be able to give you any useful suggestions.The level order is also really bad. The game isn't gated heavily, and so at any time you have a decent number of levels available to play. On the surface this seems good, but now that I'm at the halfway mark I find myself wishing all these levels were in a much more explicit order based on the skills you've demonstrated as a player so that the difficulty curve wasn't so random.~200 levels seems like a lot of levels, but this game has so many concepts that even with that number it doesn't feel like it would be enough to teach you all the things the game wants you to know to solve them. This game feels like it would have been better with half the number of areas and twice as many levels in each of them to smooth out the progression. I'm stuck on a few levels, and I really have no idea if going to a different area is going to show me anything that could become a hint for these levels so it feels like I may as well just look at a walkthrough or stop playing.I don't regret buying this game, but I think most people should stay away from it. It's not the kind of creative fun experience that you might assume it is."
6632,2571,"The best puzzle game I've ever played, bar none.This game has a simple, creative concept that leads to an ample number of creative, and sometimes incredibly difficult, puzzles. The art style is simple and charming. The music is very pleasant to listen to. It's inexpensive. Some of the profits go to charity.There's no reason not to get this game."
6633,2571,Baba is superb.  The game is full of engaging and challenging puzzles right to the end.  It also avoids becoming rote through the introduction of new ideas and mechanics all the way through and by avoiding designs which fall back on repeated use of the same tricks to solve them.  I cannot rate this highly enough - well worth every moment.
6634,2571,Game is masterpiece
6635,2571,I feel so stupid. Love this game.
6636,2571,"Baba is you is ridiculously innovative, clever, and mindblowing all at once. I laughed, I cried, I spent 40 hours of my life completing every puzzle and I don't regret a second of it. If you have even a casual interest in puzzle games, You. Must. Play. This.Baba is you. Baba is Win. You is Buy."

 IN         LT"
6638,2570,"Just when you thought the good puzzle ideas were all done...BABA IS YOU comes on to the scene with a completely fresh puzzle mechanic! As a lover of puzzle games, like Braid, Portal, Witness, etc. etc., this totally scratches those same itches. It's expertly designed with a smooth learning curve, almost every puzzle introduces some new, interesting way of thinking about the mechanics, and the aesthetics are friendly and pleasing.If you like puzzle games, GET THIS NOW!"
6639,2570,"The best puzzle game I've played in years. Clean, elegant, and hard as balls."
6640,2570,I like this game
6641,2570,"A very good game where you manipulate the very rules of the game by moving blocks on the level, I love how cool it is"
6642,2570,If you like to break your brain and/or feel dumb/like a genius buy this.
6643,2570,I'm in love with this game! The puzzles get pretty diffuicult but the different branches within a world make sure you can unlock the next world even when you get stuck in a puzzle or two.Me is Baba.
6644,2570,Best animal based puzzle game since mole mania.
6645,2570,Rose is RedViolet is BlueFlag is WinBaba is You
6646,2570,One of the best puzzle games from the past few years.
6647,2570,"My favorite puzzle game since Portal. Your aim is to manipulate the rules of the game, which are expressed via boxes of text that can be rearranged, in order to win. Genuinely fantastic puzzles that deliver those aha moments where your perspective shifts and you feel very smart or very silly."
6648,2570,"This game is okay, if you take every level and every rule on its own.  The rules are applied inconsistently between levels and within levels.  For example, you can win on a floating object, but you can push a floating object.  Water can be floated over, but a hedge cannot. Nor can a wall.  Most of the levels are pretty easy to solve, once you finally see the solution.  You get mad at yourself for making them complicated.  But part of that madness comes from seeing a level through the rules as they are written or as they may have been applied on a previous level, so you filter those options out.  If it were polished, I would say it's great, but these problems are really at the core of the game, and I cannot overlook them, so while it's a decent puzzler, it's a $5 game, at best, or a freebie someday, not a $15 game."
6649,2570,"This game is genius. To be honest, I'm not a huge fan of puzzle games. I got Stephen's Sausage Roll gifted to me and despite being widely claimed as the ""best puzzle game of all time"" I had issues with it being way too overwhelming and hard. You start a level and see like 20 moving parts immediately and don't know where to start and it ends up feeling more like a chore than fun. I can say Baba Is You is not that. It's more in line with something like The Witness, where every puzzle is it's own minigame. You instantly get and know the rules, you can instantly see what blocks you have access to, but it's still fiendishly difficult. Every time I get a solution I have a ""Eureka!"" Moment, and it feels like I appreciate how genius the puzzle design is every level. Amazing game, great for all audiences. As a bonus it teaches basic programming logic very well. ."
6650,2570,Great game!finally somone with a new game idea and original design!
6651,2570,"Baba is indeed you; but so are many other things. Don't be so full of yourself, slugcat..."
6652,2570,I'm a creep. I'm a weirdo. What the hell am I doing here?I don't belong here.
6653,2570,"It's a block pushing puzzle game based on simple predicate logic. The game does well to teach you the mechanics as you go, but one of the knacks of this game is remembering that only the mechanics that are explicit on screen are in effect. It's quite easy to miss that doors don't block movement on a particular level."
6654,2570,"Possibly one of the best puzzle games ever made.Insanely creative, and really forces you to think outside the box."
6655,2570,"Baba is amazing.I am not even usually into puzzle games, but the very intuitive way puzzles work in Baba and the infinite amount of possibilities (baba is turing complete, with the right rules you could make a platformer with it) make it both accesible and deep to a level I dont know any other puzzle game that could match it."
6656,2570,"Baba Is You is an amazing puzzle game that plays on object assignment and property manipulation unlike any other puzzle game I've seen before. It's executed very well. You are able to beat worlds without too much, but its the later levels in each world that really push your solving skills."
6657,2570,Dev Is Creative
6658,2570,Baba is You and Awesome!
6659,2570,"Baba is You... at least until you decide that Baba isn't good enough for the level and start transforming You into all sorts of other things.The main premise is simple logic. Words appear on screen that give the rules for the level. You have some control over the rearrangement of the words, provided you have access to them in the proper order. Push, pull, etc. the words and objects until you fulfill a stated win condition in the rules for the level. Sounds simple. Wrong. VERY WRONG.Levels will almost immediately start forcing you to think outside of the box to discover proper answers to levels. Yes, this does actually mean that sometimes a winning answer to a level isn't the right one, as all of a sudden you get a repeat level designed to make that previous solution unsolvable. It will require some experimentation on your part to see what does and doesn't cause a fail state in a level, but have no fear. You can undo moves and reset the level with a push of a button.This also applies to the sheer ability to pick up and play the game.It should take no more than a minute between the game finishing a boot up and you getting into a level, and gameplay can be contained into mere minutes of free time. Very few games possess this ability, really allowing you to play at one's leisure.And of course, we can't forget the best part.Rose is RedViolet is BlueFlag is WinBaba is YouOne of the best puzzle games I've seen, let alone played. Sublime in just how far presumably simple mechanics can be extended into the Full Metal Jacket of cranial boot camps that is Baba is You. The only thing that would make it perfect is a good soundtrack...Which it has.Rock Solid 9/10. Highly recommend to even the least interested in puzzle games due to its pick-up-and-play ability. Unrelated note, achievement for finding ALL the ways to win the first level when?"
6660,2570,me like fun game VERY muchwhen me is play baba: :^]me is now not play baba: :^{
6661,2570,"When I get a pet, I'm going to name is ""Baba"" in honor of this amazing game."
6662,2570,"It's hard. It's unique. It's great. Mind bending puzzle game. It's challenging, but really well designed. It throws new concepts at you in quiet a high pace. Which would be my only critique, it could have a bit more gentle learning curve, where concepts are taught and later raised in difficulty (think the witness), instead of trowing the player into cold water by the minute. But that's really a minor issue compared to what is has to offer. If you're into puzzle games this is a must buy."
6663,2570,"This might be the best puzzle game I have ever played. One of the few games in my steam library I paid full price for and would do it again. The concept seems so simple, yet whenever you encounter a new keyword you are just amazed at how the hell there are there more words/mechanics left."
6664,2570,BABA IS DOOR.
6665,2570,"I was waiting to post a review until I finished but there are just so many puzzles and I really want to talk about this game.This game is phenomenal. The creativity of the core puzzle mechanic is equally matched by the creativity of the puzzle design. The sign of a good puzzle game is that goosebumps feeling once the eureka moment kicks in on a puzzle. I've lost count of how often that's happened to me in this game. LAVA/ICE IS PUSH PogBeyond the puzzles, the art style is delightful but also, importantly, simple. Your goal, the rules, and the current state of each puzzle is immediately clear at all times. The music is also really pleasant and suits the ponderous nature of the game. Garden and Forest songs stick out in my head.My only gripe is really minor but it held me up on one puzzle for a while. When you ""die"" (there are no entities ""IS YOU""), the only button hints at the top tell you to restart or undo. But they leave out an incredibly important third option...I won't say what it is but that simple UX issue cost me a lot of time on an early puzzle. Granted, the puzzle was still tough knowing that but not tough enough to warrant all that timeOther than that (which I think was really partly my fault), the puzzles and mechanics in this game are crystal clear and the only thing stopping you from solving is your own blockhead. The core mechanic is refreshingly creative and forces you to think outside the box constantly. If this doesn't describe a good puzzle game, I don't know what does. You are seriously missing out if you don't play this.It's the kind of game that makes you jealous because you didn't think of it."
6666,2570,"This game makes me feel smart for doing better than the streamers I watch, yet at the same time stupid for not figuring out the answers to some of them without having to look at youtube solutions. Worst of all it makes me feel inadequate because this is a genius idea that will unlikely ever come from my head.10/10 would recommendAlso the music is great"
6667,2570,"Ever since I first saw ""Baba is you"" (it had 8 or so levels then and was distributed as a .zip archive), I knew it is going to be a stupidly great game one day. It is baffling that something so simple in its core has only appeared now, and it is absolutely, disgustingly fascinating.It has everything that you expect from a puzzle game, and even more that you don't.GAME            isGOOD"
6668,2570,Brain is DefeatI am edit Review for Steam :)
6669,2570,This is a charming little puzzler that hides brain-wrinkling puzzles behind its primitive/minimalistic art style. Love it!
6670,2570,"Baba is you is a mindblowing game that will start out simple and progressively get more complex as you go along. By the end it is very complex, but the solutions are often simpler than you'd expect. In the beginning you'll just enjoy the game for its uniqueness. By the middle, you'll enjoy the game for the sense of accomplishment every time you beat a level. By the end, you will enjoy the game for every twist and turn and change the game pulls. At that point, you simply desire to push on to see how the game can surprise you next, and at the very end... When all is done, you'll look back at the entire journey that took you there, and you'll see how this game somehow made you grow not just as a player, or a puzzle solver, but as a person. To persevere through this game is incredibly rewarding and satisfying. Every time you solve something you've been stuck on, it's like a weight is lifted off your shoulders.That doesn't even begin to touch on the flavor of this game. It's bizarre and adorable and yet so... driven by rules. Everything feels like it all fits together, like all these characters are simply mindless pieces of a jigsaw puzzle, but they're all so cute and lovable. The music fits the flavor perfectly, and also makes for great thinking music. The soundtrack grew on me a lot as I played it, to the point that I really adore it now and I'm wondering if Hempuli's been brainwashing me.I couldn't recommend this game any more than I already do. (Also, as of writing this, I have 52 hours in the game. I've 100% completed it. The game has seriously impressive longevity for a game with little replay value. There's no point to replaying the same puzzles, save for a few special cases, but the game has so many puzzles that by the end you won't feel like you've been cheated out of your $15)"
6671,2570,Brilliant game.  I hope this comes to IOS - it would be perfect as a portable game or something for Apple TV!
6672,2570,"I really wanted to like this game. I thought the concept of manipulating words to create sentences that effect the level was really interesting and creative. But so many of the puzzles revolve around weird and unintuitive movement mechanics that much of the game just left me feeling frustrated.Some of the things the game expects you to do feel like glitches, and not something it seems like you should be able to do. Often I would repeatedly try to solve a puzzle, sometimes for  over an hour, until I would eventually get fed up and look up the solution online. And more often than not it ends up being some ultra-specific thing that doesn't make sense why it even works. And the game doesn't do a very good job of introducing you to all the little engine quirks it expects you to know by the end of the game either.Due to the the quasi-programming nature of the sentence building mechanics, I also thought this was going to be the type of game where puzzles could have multiple solutions. But the vast majority of the levels have only one. (And from what I've seen online, the developer has even updated the game to remove solutions he had not intended.) I know most puzzle games are like this, but it's just another reason why I was disappointed by this game.I usually like puzzle games. And I did enjoy a lot of the puzzles in this one. But for every enjoyable puzzle, there were several frustrating ones inbetween. Maybe I'm just not smart enough for Baba Is You. Judging by all the positive reviews it's very likely you'll enjoy it more than I did. But I personally can not recommend it."
6673,2570,"Baba is You is  basically Sokoban with MORE mechanics. I actually hate Sokoban to be honest, but Baba is You is the best puzzle game I've ever played, and I've played quite some puzzle games in my time.There's a lot of deep and intelligently designed content in this game that challenges you in many different and always new ways. Most levels are very open and you can be quite creative with your solution.The visual style is also very, very cute and saying all the dumb sounding phrases out loud, while you're thinking about a solution, is quite fun.The only aspect of the game, that isn't 'perfect' in my opinion, is the music. While it is quite good music to think to, I wouldn't enjoy listening to it in my free time. Some 'cuter' music that matches the visuals would have been nicer, but it's alright.A level editor is also being developed right now, which would provide infinite content once released, making this game almost perfect to be honest."
6674,2570,"If you're not playing this game then, quite frankly, there's no hope for you."
6675,2570,"Baba is You is not that fun. Sure it is innovative, but most puzzles after 2-3 hours are based on one specific interaction of its rules that are unintuitive. At the same time, those unintuitive solutions are what allows the game to show how far the ""rewrite the rules"" mechanic can go. The direction that the game goes at the end really cool and unique but getting there (or solving the puzzles at that point in the game) is not that fun.After about 2 hours the puzzles start to become a chore to solve, and I started too look up solutions more and more because I didn't want to spend half an hour trying to solve 1 puzzle. There are also a couple of puzzles which use moon logic (see Prison - Dungeon). I eventually gave up and just looked up the ending portion of the game where Baba is LevelI still think its worth looking at even if it is only fun for 2 hours"
6676,2570,"A unique, fun, and particularly challenging entry to the puzzle genre. If you're like me and you like games that fit into the loosely defined ""puzzle"" genre, but think that most tend to be too easy, this game should strike your fancy. The soundtrack suits the game but it could have been a little more interesting melody-wise.I'm still playing through it, but so far I've enjoyed it enough to heartily recommend it to any people who are browsing the reviews and think the game might be up his or her alley. I bought it at full price and I'm please with my purchase."
6677,2570,"In the sweetspot between ""there is the one perfect solution"" and ""build something that kinda works i guess"""
6678,2570,"This is where I wish Steam had a more nuanced review system than Thumbs Up, Thumbs Down.Is Baba is You a detailed, novel, innovative game that deserves the praise it's getting? Yes, absolutely. Have I enjoyed playing it? No. Would I recommend it to other people? Also no.In a game supposedly about changing the rules to win in your own way, a lot of the challenges seem to revolve around one very specific solution that most often is completely unintuitive. There's a whole lot of mechanics that aren't explained very well. I found myself looking up solutions more often than not, and that's not something that's fun to do when you're playing a puzzle game. Part of the appeal of a puzzle game for me is learning the game's internal logic and becoming better at the puzzles even as they get harder. Baba is You obviously wants me to think in a different way, and occasionally, very occasionally, I can tune my brain to its wavelength and ace a puzzle which probably left other people stuck for hours. But those moments are too far apart for me. Just because I didn't enjoy the game, doesn't mean it'll be the same for you, but I can't recommend it on the basis of the experience I had."

6681,2570,Baba Is Worth
6682,2570,"Baba Is You is just an incredible, unique puzzle game. I remember when Vinny from Vinesauce streamed this game at launch and it's probably been to date the fastest I've bought a game upon first seeing it, I was immediately hooked. The whole concept of changing the rules of the puzzle to solve it is not only a concept well explored in the many puzzles that are featured, but also creates an amusing metaphysical narrative in the midst of the interactions, such as where the lack of identity means you, the player, no longer have control over the world, or certain objects or characters are annihilated from existence just from redefinition.I recommend this game if you are a fan of brain-busting, out-of-the-box lateral thinking required puzzles. Even if you aren't, I'd still say give it a shot, the game does a good job of easing into the mechanics. At launch there were a few puzzles whose mechanics were not introduced gracefully enough, but patches since then have worked to pace this progression better, making this game even better than when it started.It's also deceptively long. The time I have clocked doesn't even take into account the extra hours I spent thinking of solutions to some puzzles. Well worth the money."

6684,2570,The idea is cool but the logic doesn't make much sense when you get into the game. Baba is Win =  Victory? How does that make sense? How do you become Win?

6688,2570,I hate this game. It makes me feel like an idiot.I love this game. It makes me feel like a genius.
6689,2570,"This is a puzzle game that will make you stuck very long for some of the levels, thinking of several hours (or days) and when you suddenly have the idea you will like you are a genius (for figuring out the solution) and a idiot (for not think about that earlier) at the same time. The core idea is simple, but very flexible with enormous number of possible combinations which provided a lot of twists and surprise to the game play. In some levels there are also multiple way to solve the level. There are also a lot of levels (200+), divided into ""worlds"" which most of them introduce some new mechanics. Also, with the editor (which is not intended for players to use but there is one in the game) I can't wait to see how this game will become and what players will create in the future. Pros: Genius ideas and mechanics A lot of levels, some are really good at cleaver misdirection Level editor (which might be publicly open in the future) Fitting graphics and musicCons: Somewhat down if stuck on a level for way too longFinally, something obligatory: BA I  YO

6690,2570,"The most clever puzzle game I've played in ages. This is a great, well designed game."
6691,2570,"Love the game, love the concept. I however have two (Three but one is supposed to get fixed with an update later on) issue with the game :- There is no level editor (Should be present in a future update I heard)- There are no in-game tips. Now I'm not asking for tips to show whenever you want but a system like a very vague tip on how to solve the level after 15 minutes of being stuck like an idiot on a level would be nice. I really don't want to ruin the game by looking at guides that spoil the levels for me- The 15$ asking price seems way too high for this kind of game. Not an absurd price of course but to me, 10$ would have been better to swallow. Though for how fun the game is I don't really mind having spent 5$ more than what I would have liked"
6692,2570,BABA IS ME AND STUPID
6693,2570,"I think ""Mind bending"" is the word I'm looking for.It's a game you simply have to experience (both the idea, and the execution full of unique, interesting and fun puzzles), even if you don't play it to completion.I do think the curve is too steep, the difficulty quickly goes up. I often find myself struggling with a puzzle and thinking ""I need to solve some easier puzzles first to get my head wrapped around the mechanics"", but the easier puzzles are not there in sufficient quantity.I hope the game will be updated with more puzzles of varying difficulty to fill the gaps. On the plus side, the progression is mostly nonlinear, so if you struggle with one puzzle you can try others and go back to it later."

6695,2570,This game is a perfect example of how too much freedom can absolutely melt youfadssjdfkljadsf
6696,2570,"Baba is You is one of the best puzzle games I've played in years- maybe the best one ever. For a game made by a single developer, it shows an incredible amount of depth and complexity. I feel like it shines the most in the later levels, once several concepts are thrown together and the player is allowed to mix them together and see what works well. My only complaint about the game is that a handful of solutions were so out of left field the only way I ever would have thought of them is to mess around until I accidentally stumbled upon them (which happened on more than one instance). If you've got a friend who enjoys puzzle games, I would actually suggest playing through with them. Having a second person to bounce ideas off of really helped me out and made the experience a lot more fun than on my own, when I could be stumped for over an hour on a single level."
6697,2570,"Delightful, clever, and challenging. With a lot of good surprises. A must play for anybody who likes tough puzzle games such as Stephen's Sausage Roll."
6698,2569,<3
6699,2569,Baba is Win!
6700,2569,"Honestly, I enjoyed the game, which is why it's bothersome to refund it.The premise is clever and engaging, but there was just something that never quite ""clicked"" with me. Usually I get the basics of a puzzle game down alright and start to see solutions, but this stumped me for much longer than they normally do.This is not a point against it, but I was on the fence of buying it, so out of fear that Id have to rely on walkthrough from the word go to make progress, I refunded it until such a time where it goes on sale, as paying 13 euros for a game that I get stuck on even 10 levels in isnt that motivating. Having play countless adventure games with obscure solutions and puzzle games, I felt pretty thick when it all came together, which is generally a positive experience, but its something I expect a few levels into it after grasping the basics, and unfortunately I just never felt like I understood the basic stuff."
6701,2569,"GA  is  GO
ME      OD"
6702,2569,This game is wayyyyyyyy tooo hard. I love it.
6703,2569,"This might be my all-time favorite puzzle game. The system is so flexible that it all comes down to puzzle design, and that's expertly executed, so that solving each puzzle requires understanding its concept, yet solving them is smooth enough that you don't get hung up on uninteresting details."
6704,2569,"This is my favorite puzzle game in a long time. It's fairly difficult, but offers a lot of branching so you can easily skip certain levels when you get stuck. Highly recommend. If you find the wobbly graphics tiring, you can turn them off in settings. There is also a deceptive amount of game here, much longer than I expected."
6705,2569,"This game is well worth its price. It's fun, it's cute, it's amazingly clever and hella difficult. I checked solutions to two levels online simply because I couldn't wrap my head around them to the point where I was convinced they were impossible to solve. Had that feeling a lot afterwards, but from that point on kept trying until I solved them myself, which is always very rewarding.If you're into puzzle games, get this one. If you're easily frustrated when your first, or second, or even tenth solution didn't work out... definitely get this one, you need to learn to think better.Yeah, I am going to say it: this game will make you smarter."
6706,2569,"This game is way smarter than me.It may be the most clever game I've ever played, whit cute graphics and sound design.Deffinitely a GOTY contender for me, and whith the level editor comming the fun can never end.Baba is Buy."
6707,2569,BABA is SUFFER has LOVE (from me)
6708,2569,"""Baba is You"" is a puzzle game polished to perfection. Its creator, Mr. ""Hempuli"" Teikari takes on a simple concept and expands on it in every thinkable direction, creating mindbending and creative puzzles along the way. The puzzles are cleverly crafted and require you to think out of the box and make full use of the game's simple soncept. It is so simple yet so elegant. It is the kind of game where other developers will be angry of why they didn't come up with this by themselves. Full recommendation."
6709,2569,yes
6710,2569,One of the hardest puzzle games I've played. Definitely worth the buy.
6711,2569,"A great puzzle game that leaves me with only one gripe:Why isn't the soundtrack called ""BABA IS MUSIC"" or ""SOUNDTRACK IS PLAY""?!?!?!"
6712,2569,"Very satisfying puzzles and refreshingly different from all other block-pusher puzzle games, truly an innovative new spin.The art style fits the ""baby talk"" sentences you create perfectly and the music is subtle and relaxing."
6713,2569,Nothing to say that hasn't already been said.
6714,2569,"By far the hardest and most intense puzzle game I've ever played. Simple, simple mechanics, relaxing and oddly meditative, immense emergent depth. A completely unique game, constantly twists your brain in ways no other game has."
6715,2569,"This game, and I do NOT say this lightly, is one of the best puzzle games I have ever played, if not the best. The base mechanic of changing rules is very easy to pick up on, but is very easy to add complexity to for harder puzzles. And for the harder puzzles, this game does difficulty perfectly. Because of the undo button, death is not a punishment, merely an obstacle. And for a puzzle game of this caliber, it doesn't need to be punishment to ""increase difficulty"". The puzzles are hard enough for your brain that the game still feels super hard without being frustrating, and that is what this game excels at.The level design itself is also very good. Most sections of the game revolve around a specific mechanic they introduce, and the first puzzle in that section is a level that tutorializes the mechanic while still being a good puzzle. It's the best way of integrating learning the game into it, because you do not need any outside guide for this game at all.Overall, this game is top notch and got me motivated enough to leave a review for it. 10/10, game of the year so far 100%. I cannot stress enough how much I adore this game."
6716,2569,GAMEISHARD
6717,2569,Absolutely one of the best puzzlers I've ever played.  Plenty of content and an excellent premise.  The player is given time at the beginning of each area to learn the new mechanics for that area before the difficulty is ratcheted upward.  Subsequent areas add new mechanics and more difficulty--but the game still gives the player time to breathe.
6718,2569,"Take programming, make it simple. Thats ""Baba is you"" in a nutshell.Your opportunities are endless. Be Baba? No problem. Be a rock? No problem. Be the  wall? Hell yeah no problem.Love this game. - 11/10"

6722,2569,"This is a fantastic game that comes with great designing and hours of headaches. Gets hard really fast and players might suffer frustration, but I still recommend it. 100% worth the price if you like to torture your brain every now and then."
6723,2569,"Baba Is You is truly innovative, and another fantastic example of how a game can last a long time if it has just one solid mechanic at its core. However, I personally cannot recommend it on the basis of its puzzles.Most times, Baba's puzzles felt unintuitive, with so many steps along the way to the solution that I just couldn't find the patience to clear them - and let's face it, having to spoil a game by looking up a walkthrough isn't very fun. ""Causing surprising interactions"" just isn't interesting anymore when almost 100% of the time, you're stuck on the wrong ones.However, 98% of user reviews can't possibly tell a lie, so if you're a big puzzle fan, you're probably better off giving it a chance.TL;DR If you're a bumbling idiot like I am, Baba is You isn't for you."
6724,2569,"Fantastic puzzle game, cannot recommend enough."
6725,2569,Baba is me?Lose is cry?Me is cry.
6726,2569,"Just great!Positives:- Concept has never been used before- Very challenging- Not all puzzles are required to be solved in order to progress- Cool art style- Often there are multiple ways to solve a levelNegatives:Found only two minor things to criticize:- Music is repetetive- There should be an option to reduce the ""wobble"" effect rather than an On/Off switchSo if you like puzzle games, i definetly reccomend you to try this one."
6727,2569,It's really really good. It's mostly not hard it's just you're blind
6728,2569,"Baba is You is probably my favorite puzzle game of all time. It's extremely intuitive and solving the levels makes you feel like a genius. The basic concept is very simple but the game keeps expanding on it in interesting ways. The graphics, music and atmosphere in general are perfect for the kind of game it is and they allow you to concentrate on the logics behind a level.And that's definitely important, because Baba is You quickly gets very challenging. There is a huge amount of levels so you can get a lot of value for your money here but the difficulty really ramps up at some point.This is the only downside of the game in my opinion. It's easy to get stuck on a level if you don't understand what to do. I've spent minutes upon minutes in certain levels and to no avail. Be prepared to grind your brain gears at full speed. And remember to take breaks to cool it down every now and then.I'm pretty much stuck on all the levels I currently have access to but I still find myself returning to the game again and again. And when a level you've been stuck on finally clicks in your head, the feeling is great.Game is recommendedisgreat(Also apparently they're gonna add a level editor so that's sweet)"

6737,2569,"a simlpe concept taken to clever extremes. similar to The Witness, Baba is you seeks to really challenge you by taking away obvious choices, and forcing you to come up with a more complex solution through its level design. The design of the levels is also worth of celebration, as they do not suffer from the common puzzle problem. You cannot immedeatly get hints to the solution though how the levels are designed. the levels have some artistic extra to help disguise your options, and actually led to genuine discovery.also it runs impressivly snappy. start up times under 3 seconds, and instant close times!"
6738,2569,I'm too dumb for this
6739,2569,Believe the hype!
6740,2569,"This game is ingenious in many ways. But I will start with the flaws first, because, to get to the good, you must overcome the bad first:1. Weird level number titling. It would definitely benefit if the creator of this game can maybe slumps the levels in one area into a chain, and then goes on to the next ones. It would definitely be weird to go from Level 9 to Level 13 in an instant.2. Not enough instruction: A little bit nit-picky here, but it would help to explain to the players what would happen, when either an object is not under a rule, how the ""MOVE"" function works, how the game would go if there were multiple Babas, or something like that sort.3. No hints: As will be discussed later on, this game executes an ingenious idea, but if solely based the game on that idea, it will have to resort to harder levels. That's where hints would definitely helps. Maybe lines to tell you what rules should be reached by the end, or a picture of the final scene.4. Restart mechanics: It would definitely help to have a function to allow direct restart, rather than having to drag the cursor to agree, in a game where you will definitely reset the level at least twice.5. Windowed playing is a chore: As a person who likes to multi-task, I would almost always window apps, to use it concurrently. But the windowed version of this app takes that to a default Sticky Note sized application, and it is very annoying.6. The ""IS"" and ""AND"" button should standout more, preferably with colors that are not darker than whatever they are right now.That's my bad points, albeit ultra-nitpicky. Now, here are the goods:1. Ingenious idea of literally rule-changing. I do not want to imagine the amount of codes that amount to this game, being a developer myself.2. Smart levels and designs. The ability to change everything based on blocks of text really helps, and with a wide variety of verbs and nouns to describe everything, it allows for a low of creative mash-up of rules.3. The ""AND"" function, multi-rule, and chain rule: It adds more, not only to the possibilities, but also to the level of difficulties that can be achieved.What would I wish for?1. Level creating. It would be quite a toll on an indie game, but believe me, this would be catalyst for so many level extensions and level updates. Allowing community levels and using some of the mechanics in those levels are extremely smart and resourceful.2. Probably anything I have listed in the bad section?Now, it looks like I have stated more bad here, but believe me, people will appreciate the nit-pickiness that I have put in here, because it cannot get any worse than whatever I have said here. And also, if looked carefully enough, the bads I have listed are much more detailed and small, while the goods I have listed revolved around the magnificent mechanics this game holds, can hold, and will hold. I cannot wait for this game to grow more."
6741,2569,"Baba is You is a unique puzzle game, with principle that can be changed in order to complete each level. Levels difficulty is very diverse and requirs out-of-the-box thinking.

6744,2569,"Blah blah game is incredibly good, but just wanna rant a little bit about levels.Generally they are almost perfect, using a lot of fascinating mechanics, but sometimes a level's idea is based on some weird and/or inconsistent implementation details (I am looking at you, Skull House!). No deep logic behind such levels, and you basically should randomly discover a weird rule (or look for hints). It discourages to solve a puzzle more than a couple hours, because you start to think that maybe it is again some weird combination of in-game rules, and exhaustive search is the only reliable method.But such cases are rare (but quite frustrating), so it is not a reason to not a buy a game."

6748,2569,"A box pushing puzzler mixed with a simple but deep logic puzzles makes this a winner. Every puzzle requires you to twist your brain and change your boundaries of thinking to solve, and it's bloomin' great.

It's worth the full price, even if the visuals give the outward impression of a quick and dirty pixel-art indie game."

When you get a key and a door, you never know if in the end you'll use the key on the door, the door on the key, a random potted plant as the key, if you'll clone yourself into keys. Added to that, the pushing-text-around can add a layer of box pushing puzzles to everything. Every level is unique, every level is a mindtwister, every level is super counterintuitive and multi-layered, but they still aren't too hard and *very* easy to understand.

6782,2568,"I Open the Key with the Door, the Door that Is You.I turn Water to Words and Sink them in Stone.I become BABA, the one who Is me."
6783,2568,This is a brain torture disguised as a puzzle game. 10/10 would recommend
6784,2568,"This is a good one. Soundtrack is really good too. Easy on the senses. Works flawlessly on Linux.Difficulty curve is a bit lumpy at times but the world map opens up early on, so there's always other stuff to do if you get stuck.I managed to crash it at one point through runaway item cloning, but that's entirely my own fault. It's very hard to unintentionally break this game, everything about the rule system stays internally consistent at all times.Best if you don't spoil it for yourself."
6785,2568,"Baba is you is a brutal puzzle game the likes of which I have not seen in a long, long time. The last puzzle game I remember that achieved this level of mind-boggling greatness was Denki Blocks for the GBA. And that was in 2001, excluding ports.By ""brutal"" I mean extremely challenging and extremely well designed.Many solutions are *very* obtuse, but aren't devoid of logic. Often, you'll find out that the extremely obtuse puzzles give you a sort of tool or method to use later on once you understand how it worked. You have to experiment and figure out how the mechanics work.If you're the type who likes to analyze things and think extremely hard, this is the best puzzle game I've played in who knows how long. I thought the genre was long since dead and filled with match-three garbage. I was wrong."
6786,2568,"This is one of the most interesting puzzle games which makes you rethink the concept of puzzle games. It has very nice pixel graphics, soothing sound track and doesn't dissapoint according to trailer. You can do really anything imaginable with each puzzle. 11/10!"
6787,2568,"Game is brilliant, favorite of 2019 currently"
6788,2568,Truly epic. One of the best games of all time.
6789,2568,Game is DifficultGame is CreativeGame is FunBaba is You and GameBuy is Good
6790,2568,One of the best puzzle games I've ever played. Simple but charming graphics with riddles that will give you a really good feeling when you solve them.
6791,2568,"Easily one of the greatest puzzle games I've ever played. It asks a simple question: ""What if the rules of the game could be changed from within the game itself?"" and takes this to its logical extreme. Early on you'll have a wide grin as the game constantly throws new and unexpected ways that you can reprogram levels from inside of them. Later, the game asks you to master those concepts in order to progress through all of the ""bonus"" content.Pros:+ Great puzzle design, that shows and doesn't tell+ Good soundtrack that keeps you focused without getting in the way+ Fun graphics that fit the theme+ Fast undo/restart keeps you in the puzzle, instead of fighting the game+ Lots of levels (more than you think!)Cons:- Occasionally it is difficult to fully understand precisely how mechanics work. A sandbox mode would be good to play around with the game rules in an unconstrained environment.- Difficulty of puzzles can be a bit all over the place (hard puzzles followed by very easy ones).- Occasional crashes in edge cases (a stack of 10,000 flags causes out-of-memory errors)- No level editor (coming soon?)"
6792,2568,"GAME is CUTE and INNOVATIVEmakesACHEonBRAINIf you think you're smart, and want to feel dumb when you run into truly impossible puzzles, and also like messing with blocks, and rules, and cute bunnies, and transforming the entire world into yourself... BABA is YOU."
6793,2568,"This puzzle game is amazing. The puzzles get really tricky but if you are into tricky puzzles, it is a mind blowing moment, when you finally figure out a solution. Why A solution and not THE solution? Most of the puzzles can be solved in several different ways, easy or complex ;)"
6794,2568,Baba is UwU
6795,2568,An extremely unique puzzle game with simple rules that can be changed in order to complete the level. The game is difficult. I'm only on the 3rd section and each puzzle is starting to make me question my puzzle-solving skills. The levels are unique and can be solved in multiple different ways allowing for many creative solutions. I highly recommend this game as so far it is my favorite of 2019 and I imagine it will be a contender on others' lists.  PS: Thank you NL for convincing me to buy yet another game
6796,2568,"Thanks to this game, I've learned about the power of simple words, and how to create magnificent white poems. Would love to present my last creation: Rose is redViolet is blueBaba is you...Push and pull is rockKeke is KekeShut is defeat...Water is meltFlag is winCog and wall and YouGame is 10/10."

6801,2568,Baba is youBaba is funBaba is good
6802,2568,Fantastic puzzle game that requires very different thinking than most and often very different thinking from one level to the next.  Great music as well.  Absolutely recommended to anyone that enjoys puzzle games.
6803,2568,Excellent puzzle game. A very nice difficulty curve constantly leaving you struggling to think in a different way and rewarding your moments of inspiration with easy to execute really hard to see answers.
6804,2568,"There have been several times this game has made me feel like an idiot and I want to yell when I realize the solution to some hard problem.Baba Is You is a great puzzle game. I've only beaten the first two serious areas (kinda) 5 hours in, and it seems like there's quite a bit more content to go through. I'm going to try to go for completion if I can."
6805,2568,"I'm not a big puzzle fan in general, but I do love unique puzzles. As a game, this is a great one."
6806,2568,"This game starts with a fun and interesting premise, then proceeds to get more insane and mind bending. Every time you think it's out of surprises it proves you wrong. If you're a fan of difficult puzzle games this is an absolute must."

6810,2568,BABA IS GOTY.
6811,2568,Marvelously tricky.Very hard to put away. Baba IS Me.
6812,2568,"creative idea for a puzzle game but in practice, playing it just evokes the same feeling as writing and debugging code, which i'd say NO ONE could enjoy but i see that 88 metascore so it must be some people's thingthe chill atmosphere and music is appreciated and i dig the ms paint-esque graphics but it wasn't really enough to make up for the tedium of what was actually going on, i know it's a puzzle game but i really don't enjoy just pacing around in the game trying to think of what i haven't tried yet, the short ""aha!"" moment when you figure it out isn't really worth it"
6813,2568,"Just watching a few minutes of a livestream made this a must-buy for me. A puzzle game with an extremely interesting base mechanic, expanded upon and elaborated on over the course of the game, not unlike Portal (although the similarities mostly end there). Would recommend."
6814,2568,"Incredible game. The total number of puzzle is incredible (it took me more than 30 hours to complete), and the game keep throwing new mechanics and tricks at you. Whenever you think you've seen everything the game has to give, it proves you wrong. Note that most puzzles are quite hard, and some even took me around an hour of intense thinking and trial and error before finally getting it.The basic concept would have been enought to make it a good game, but they really went above and beyond any expectations with this."
6815,2568,"This is one of the games were your initial thoughts on new levels are :""Holy crap, these are impossible...""and they actually are exactly this, as far as I know..."

6818,2568,Absolutely fantastic little puzzle game with an ingenious premise. The game is not afraid to be too hard on the player. Baba Is Us
6819,2568,This is a heckin' good puzzle game. It's so good even people who don't play puzzle games enjoy it.
6820,2568,Bought this game because the store said it's similar with Rabi-Ribi.That turned out to be totally accurate.
6821,2568,"This game is really challenging and is amazing if you are into puzzle games. Gameplay:The game will progressively increase the number of mechanics as you play on, but it doesn't mean early levels are easy, it is just as challenging as the later ones. It is important the learn the rules inside-out, and need you to think outside the box all of the time.Important note:Egg has Cracked, Egg is Bad, I is Mad. I has Game, Baba is fun and Let's Go.by another victim of the Northernlion Effect"
6822,2568,"Baba is You is an absolute delight, standing out for its creative mechanics and constantly fresh level design.I would describe it as the best example of a blocksworld puzzle game that I've experienced. If you like the genre you'll love it. If you've not tried the genre this is the best possible game to try it with. If you don't like the genre...well it probably won't convert you. It is what it is and not every game suits every player.The basic gameplay is to walk around a 2D area pushing blocks into the right formation to win the level. The twist is that some of the blocks contain rules indicating how the blocks behave - which ones can be pushed, destroy each other, move by themselves, are the objective that makes you win the level, and so on.The titular ""Baba is you"" refers to a common arrangement of three blocks that makes the sheep you. That means your controls move the sheep. If there's more than one sheep then they move all of them at once. If you somehow disassemble ""Baba is you"" then your controls do nothing - unless you've made something else be you by pushing some other rule blocks around.Every few levels the game introduces new blocks and most of them significant change game play. A little shy of 20 levels in I'm still seeing new blocks and they're not slight transformations on old blocks but things that make new types of puzzle and solution possible. Stuff like ""and"" and ""not"" allowing conditional phrases, ""empty"" allowing you to perform some operation on every space containing nothing, ""word"" causing a block to simultaneously count as what it is and a rule block describing what it is, with the properties of both - the new additions feel creative rather than derivative and most levels will stretch you rather than being a trivial expansion on what you already knew.If you like logic puzzles, lateral thinking or blocksworld games pick it up immediately. If you want to try something new then it's different to most other games out there at the moment. If you're interested in game design then it's worth the price of admission to see an innovative take on an old mechanic.The creator also pledges 10% of their personal income to charity via efficient altruism, that's not a reason to grab a game on its own, but it's an extra thing to feel good about in getting it."

6837,2568, is 
6838,2568,"It's been a while since I've played a game that's so simple in concept yet so genius in its execution. The game starts out really simple to let the player get the hang of the rules and slowly ramps up the difficulty of the puzzles as the player progresses. I often found myself dumb founded at how the answers were staring at me right in the face but I just had to think about the solutions in a different perspective. It just felt so refreshing to sit there, thinking about how I could go about things, over complicating the process only to find out that the solution was actually really simple. There is so much elegance in the simplicity of the game.Even if you are able to speed through the puzzles blazingly fast I think the execution of the idea makes the experience well worth it. Definitely a game that needs to be tried out in my opinion.Quite possibly one of the most refreshing games I've played this year"
6839,2568,"Fantastic puzzle game. Every puzzle solved makes you feel like a genius, and also leads to you shouting absurd things like ""Baba is not crab! Baba is Baba! Crab is win!"""
6840,2568,"Pros: + Baba is cute + Music is nice + Puzzles are smart Cons: - Levels appear in a weird order? Look, I'm stretching here to find even one negative point with this game to keep my review format, don't judge me! In-depth:I hate puzzles. It's not like there's anything inherently wrong with them, I'm just usually not smart enough for them. Or not patient enough. To grab my attention and to keep me playing, a puzzle game has to be something special.The last few years were pretty good for puzzle games. There were a lot of them and many were good. But only two of them were special enough for me.One is Opus Magnum. The amount of satisfaction you get from it and the sheer willpower you need to have to not spam your friends with the gifs of your creations made it one of my favorite puzzles ever made.The other is... well... it's Baba.Baba is amazing. It's cute. It's fun. It either makes you feel incredibly smart or incredibly stupid, but it's always incredible. There is often more than one solution for a problem, which is awesome, because different people may think differently and find their own approaches. The whole idea to change the rules of the world is just brilliant. It makes you think outside the box.I especially love the levels that have the same layout but different rules (although don't worry, the level variety is pretty big, the repetition is rare and very intentional). It breaks your mind, but in the right and very satisfying way.Baba makes you think about what elements you should use, what elements you can't use at all and what elemets are there to distract you. It's very simple at it's core, but not easy. It's mechanics are intuitive, but it keeps adding new ones as you play to keep things fresh.I wish I had more to say about this game. I honestly can't find a single flaw with it. I like it visually, I like the music, I like the gameplay. But there's nothing I can add that will make you buy this game. You either love what you see already, in the screenshots and videos on both Steam and Youtube, or you don't and it's also fine. You just need to find your own puzzle game, something that will click with you personally, like Baba did with me. But if you like what you see and still hesitate - don't. It's exactly what it looks like and you will love every second of it.BABA IS WIN"
6841,2568,"The game is intriguingly hard as Stephen's Sausage Roll, and well-designed as the Witness.This will be one of my favorite puzzle games I have ever played!However, I don't want to recommend it to non-puzzlers,not just because it is too hard but also because several puzzles (even regular ones) require dealing for subtle situations.To solve puzzles you sometimes have to think what would happen if ""flag is win"" as well as ""flag is defeat"",or if ""rock is flag"" as well as ""rock is wall"".I actally loved this aspect of the game, but it might annoy the people who don't like 'finding rules'."
6842,2568,"Baba is you,Stupid is me"
6843,2568,"You need to think like the game has logic, but the logic from a 9 year old when he writes a story as a homework.The hole game makes sense. But some details dosen't. And It's frustating. - 11/10 will reboot my brain"

6849,2568,"Got this game because watching Northernlion is Hard. The game is awesome, really makes you think, great design. The difficulty spikes up pretty fast - atleast I feel like it does."
6850,2568,What is BABA
6851,2568,"Wow.  Just, wow.  Hard, but not impossible, although some levels seem that way.  You'll be vexed and thoroughly challenged, and when you figure out that puzzle that's been gnawing at you, you'll feel so good, you will do your happy dance... even if you are in a public place.  My IQ has gone up 10 points since I've started playing.  This game is worth every cent.  An instant classic.  BABA IS ME."
6852,2568,Baba Is Win
6853,2568,"I just started this game as of 90 minutes of play time.  This is a ""big brain"" game that doesn't hold your hand, but isn't frustrating at the same time.  It reminds me of the joy of solving the puzzles from any of the Zelda games."
6854,2568,It's like the Sekiro of video games.
6855,2568,One of the most unique puzzle games I have ever played (so far)
6856,2568,"Has easily earned a place as one of my favorite puzzle games, if not my absolute favorite puzzle game, full stop. Within the introduction alone, the game teaches everything you need to know - that being that the only steadfast rule is that readable sentences are true. As it progresses, the challenge increases significantly as more and more words are introduced to the logic lexicon, while still being in simple enough chunks to understand for anyone capable of reading. With a charming art style reminiscent of a child's drawing book and chill music that reminds you to take your time, this game is an absolute joy to sit down and unwind with, cannot recommend it enough to just about anyone of any age or experience with games."
6857,2568,"Fun and creative puzzle game.The puzzles are grouped in zones with levels gradually becoming harder. The first couple of levels are relatively easy but serve as a way to showcase new concepts specific to that zone, which you will need in later levels.You are free to choose the order in which you want to clear the zones and its levels, so if you get stuck you can move on to a different one and come back to it later."
6858,2568,"Great game! Very simple concept but really makes you think, it's super fun. Totally worth the money."
6859,2568,"I've followed this game since its prototype and the official release took an already novel concept and expanded it in a really polished, fun experience. If you even remotely like puzzles, a must buy!"
6860,2568,Mindbreaking puzzle game... and have some really hard levels.. liked a lot
6861,2568,"I've always been very picky with puzzle games, so much so that there's very few that I really enjoy thoroughly. This is one of those games that I enjoy thoroughly. It's very well designed, has a heck ton of puzzles and yet somehow nearly every single one of them is a unique challenge.Thanks you Northernlion for showcasing this game, it's really just incredible."
6862,2568,"What a brilliant puzzle game. It's exquisite in its simplicity, but still really makes you think. It's a game that really rewards you for problem-solving and lateral thinking, too. GOTY 2019, and no, I don't think I'm too early.Baba Is Win. Baba Is You."
6863,2568,Nice logic puzzle. BABA is FUN
6864,2568,An amazingly unique and well designed experience that I am too stupid to enjoy. I unfortunately played it too long for a refund.  Steam's refund policy.
6865,2568,The game is so easy in concept and absolutely masterful in how complex and convoluted the solutions end up being. Absolutely worth the play.
6866,2568,"This game is mind-blowingly amazing. Difficult and thought-provoking, yet also simple and endearing. If you like puzzle games, do yourself a favor and buy this immediately."
6867,2568,"Great puzzle game that's somehow even more than meets the eye. Very good and clever use of its gimmick that goes further than just ""changing rules"". Also a lot of content."

6869,2568,A very original puzzle game. My programmer brain loves it.Some puzzles are really really difficult. Some seem flat out impossible at a first glance. But after hours of messing around and trying different things they eventually click.

6877,2568,"In short: sokobon mixed with visual programming, excellent.bit longer: Quite a mind bender. A game which manages to build confusing and challenging puzzles with a very basic set of rules. Very intentionally designed, there aren't many puzzles that you can beat using an unintended solution. There is something amusing and sinister about a game that displays the rules at all times like they're hints but still you struggle with them. It's a wildly creative game for how limited this genre tends to be.It does have some flaws however. It throws you into the deep end very early on and there are some very important interactions that aren't obvious and the game expects you to figure out instead of teaching you. very few puzzles suffer from this luckily, and depending on your temper this could be a good thing. These interactions scale however, you can skip certain levels and figure out a trick on another that is relevant. The music also contains honks of a somewhat threatening aura. This does not bother me but I know someone who was disturbed by this.It's fun, get it."
6878,2568,GA     MEISGOOD
6879,2568,"One of, if not ""the"", best puzzle games out there"
6880,2568,Perfect game. Purchased right away and got exactly what I've expected after watching a trailer.Strongly recommend for the people who into such puzzle games.
6881,2568,"I think the best puzzle games are the ones where the final solution is simple and elegant. I often find myself marvelling after solving a puzzle in Baba is YOu, that it took me so long to see something that was in the end fairly straightforward. The design in minimal and elegant in its minimaalism.,"
6882,2568,"The Good- Simple yet sweet and cartoonish graphics that are quite nice to look at. The level design is also very good.- A big number of levels, which can become incredibly challenging. The solution of many of them can be very creative.- A pretty nice OST that reminds me of old school games, quite cheap as well.The Neutral- If you're doing this game without hints, prepare to twist your brains: some of them require to think WAY out of the box and know specific mechanics.- This game could use some mod compatibility for new levels and maybe new words, just a suggestion though.The Bad- Can't really think of anything.Veredict: A solid A+. A must-have for puzzle lovers!"
6883,2568,BABA IS HOTBRAIN IS MELT
6884,2568,"Don't be fooled by its cutesy facade, the game is hard! I thought this would be another one of those gimmicky games with novel mechanics but boy oh boy was I wrong about this one. Despite the novel mechanics (lol), the puzzles in this game are surprisingly solid and I'm really really impressed by the amount of thought that has been put into the making of each level.The first few levels will lead you into a false sense of security and then the difficulty curve just go straight up and you'll really have to scratch your head quite a bit to find solutions - and this is all before more and more words are gradually added to the mix, making it even HARDER, but this is not me complaining, this is what a proper puzzle game looks like.Buy it and try it for yourself, the novelty and the thoughts and love put into the game by the developers really make it shine, it's pretty good."
6885,2568,"Essentially teaches you the mechanics and then throws you into the deep end. In practice it's a little more gradated than that, because each world introduces a new word or two and gives you a couple of easier levels before getting into the meat of it, but beyond that the level of challenge is consistent: the puzzles are both so difficult and so elegant that there's no telling which ones you'll find easier than others. It all depends on whether that flash of intuition strikes you sooner or later. Fortunately, the worlds are designed in such a way as to allow you to skip quite a few of the puzzles, so if you find yourself stumped on one, you can work on another."
6886,2568,"Oh my god this game is perfectGreat level design. Perfect example of ""show don't tell"" when introducing players to new mechanics."
6887,2568,"I'm not a big puzzle game guy, but this game just pulls you in with its charming aesthetic and gentle introduction to its mechanics. 10/10 Baba is Love"
6888,2568,"This is a really great puzzle game that does everything a puzzle game should.  It made me whine, ""I don't understand.."" at my monitor."

6903,2567,"I've been following the development of this ever since I saw it on itch.io and I'm happy it finally released. It's a lot of fun to try out different combinations of words and see what happens.Some levels were real headscratchers but it feels rewarding when you figure it out.I have not played it for super long yet so take that as you will, but so far I'm happy I got it. Perfect game for when you need something cozy. Also Baba is pretty cute."
6904,2567,"BABA IS YOUBABA IS GOODREVIEW IS BABA IS YOUOkay but seriously this game is fun.  You can manipulate the rules of the world by combining words into different statements.So, if there is an obstacle you might be able to make WALL IS PUSH.   Then you can push the walls around.  Or maybe even WALL IS YOU.  Then you control the walls.It gets more involved in that, things like AND or multiple attributes you can make one thing.  Or turning objects into other objects!If you like puzzle games I would highly recommend BABA IS YOU."
6905,2567,baba you rock
6906,2567,Haven't even finished the game and I can recommend it. Really creative puzzles that can be quite challenging.10/10 would Baba again.
6907,2567,"Tremendously cute, unique as far as I know, decent pacing in level difficulty, AND THERE IS NO TUTORIAL! The game is just designed well enough that you don't need one!I'll update this as I play through with some metadata for you, prospective buyer!-No story, no cutscenes (so far), just puzzles and cuteness-No tutorial - this is a GOOD thing, there are only 6 hotkeys (7 if you count pause) and the mechanics are very consistent-It has a 'complete X of these Y puzzles to progress' instead of 'complete all puzzles linearly,' so no worries about getting stuck on one level unable to progress! (Note: You can, and probably receive some bonus reward for, completing all levels.)"
6908,2567,"I love when games make you feel smart and stuff, get it and feel like a genius today!"
6909,2567,"A wickedly difficult puzzle game that has you altering the rules of the world to reach the goal, often one you had to puzzle out what it even would be. Before the end of the first world one of my solutions was to create a paradox to vaporize the walls so I could make a starfish the goal point. You need a Galaxy Brain for this."
6910,2567,It's a wonderful puzzle game. Gets very tough fast.
6911,2567,Have a couple of hours on this game and all   i have to say is outstanding and great job.   This game really has you thinking outside the box in a way that will have you coming back for more.  Brilliant idea and a bargain price.  Buy it!
6912,2567,BABA is FUN
6913,2567,Excellent puzzle game with tons of levels that are very well crafted. Money well spentGame is funGame is recommended
6914,2567,A puzzle game where the rules of the puzzle are just another object to manipulate. Cute art and soundtrack too.
6915,2567,game is win
6916,2567,"This game is so good! It has been a long time, that a puzzle game has been so much relaxed fun. Some levels just catch you by surprise and you can't see the forest for the trees. You try absolutely ridiculous setups and after pulling your hair for ten minutes straight you finally see the light and complete the level in seconds. This game has nothing but charme. No cringey humour, no poor dialogue, just a refreshing and very creative take on block pushing puzzles."
6917,2567,Amazing
6918,2567,"super hard game. i probably am not going to be able to beat it.despite that, i love it and recommend it, honestly.even if this game is so wack that i just don't get any of it about 3 or 4 areas past the tutorials i loved every second with iteven when i had no clue what i was doing, it was still so zen i didn't really get frustrated"
6919,2567,All IS LoveLove IS BabaBaba IS You
6920,2567,"BABA IS GOODME IS DUMBExcellent game. I honestly did not expect to enjoy this game so much. The concept is so basic yet executed so well. No puzzle feels like it's trying to just trick you or hoping you miss a simple bit of information like many other puzzle games do, everything follows basic logic and you'll feel stupid sometimes for not having figured it out earlier.The solution to many puzzles might seem simple when watching someone solve it but the true challenge comes from understanding how to manipulate the rules of the level by pushing around simple words.It's like someone told you to change how a script in a game works by just rearranging existing functions.Behind the exterior of this simple looking game there is a fantastic experience that will surely get that brain working.I've barely only scratched the surface of what this game has to offer and I'm both excited and scared to jump back in to see more."
6921,2567,"Absolutely do not buy the game if you aren't ready to think outside the box because in this game, you have to think both in and out of the box and if that doesn't work, become the box itself. The game is also relatively long. As of writing this I am 5 hours in and by the looks of it, only 20% of the way through (and puzzles tend to get harder as the game goes on).I'd recommend it, especially as something you can distract yourself with alongside a podcast or whatever (like I tend to do)."
6922,2567,The game is amazing. Such a simple and clever idea! Best Puzzle Game in a minute.
6923,2567,Baba is you is puzzle game that let you change the win condition and rule of the game as you play. Very unique and fun to play make you think outside of box in order to solve the puzzle.
6924,2567,"""This game is pretty good"" i think as i chew on my secret bonus points while struggling to find the secret exit to a tough level in the secret world's secret world.I wonder how far down the rabbit hole goes.PS. YOUR LEVELS ARE WEAK(Spoiler) PPS. My GHOSTAR is better than yours."
6925,2567,10/10 Best puzzle game I have played. Question every assumption. Make more assumptions. Question those.
6926,2567,baba is you is good and has fun
6927,2567,Played 7 minutes of the game and already farther than E-Sports legend Northen got. Great game and really enjoyable puzzles!
6928,2567,Well done!
6929,2567,"Just found the first ""meta"" puzzle in the game and immediately decided to write a review. This is undoubtedly one of the best, if not THE best puzzle game I have ever had a pleasure of playing. And haven't even finished it yet!I was really excited for this game after playing the Nordic Game Jam version, but the finished result exceeds my wildest exspectations.Just about everything in it is absolutely delightful, but the very gist, the mechanics and the puzzles built upon them - are of a quality and variety I've never seen before. It's all very nicely knit together, while not becoming stale or frustratingly hard - at least, that's how I feel after playing for almost 13 hours.(BABA) {IS} (BEST)(also, please do check Stephen's Sausage Roll if you liked this game, it really deserves more love)"
6930,2567,Baba is PuzzleBaba is GoodGood is Win
6931,2567,"As i figured out the trick to a puzzle i muttered to myself ""that's right Baba is Baba ""Best and most mind bending puzzle game since Portal 2"
6932,2567,Baba is win
6933,2567,"This is one of the best puzzle games I've played. There's a surprisingly large amount of content here - starting from simple(ish) puzzles to get you used to the core mechanics, passing through harder puzzles that test your understanding of those mechanics, and winding up taking the concept places you'd never expect. The game is continuously inventive and hilarious throughout all this.  Well worth 11 of anyone's money."
6934,2567,Good ass game
6935,2567,game logic is Easybutpuzzle is  varied.Bought 6 portions for my 6 sonsHope them enjoy it. XD
6936,2567,"this is easily the best puzzle game ive played in the past few years. you might think that a game that relies in a single gimmick would get repetitive quickly, but baba is you manages to make every puzzle and solution unique. of the levels ive completed (128 as of this review), virtually none have been solved in ways similar to others, and even the ""extra"" versions of some levels require very different solutions and approaches to solving.the main gimmick itself is very fun to mess around with and figure out as well; messing with the rules of the game is incredibly satisfying and there are countless ways that you can arrange the blocks of instructions to create different rules (and even those rules interact with each other in different ways). not only that, but the rules of every level are different and the situations presented always require some experimentation with a level's available objects.the puzzles themselves are all deeply complex; as i said before, no two levels ive played have been solved in similar ways. the game makes use of new and old mechanics at the same time comprehensively, making each puzzle unique. each level requires you to actually pay attention, and nothing about the puzzles get old or repeat in subsequent puzzles.i genuinely cannot come up with any flaws that this game has. i never thought that a puzzle game that relied on one mechanic could be as deep, difficult, and outright fun to play as baba is you, but this game took that assumption and kicked it in the  nuts.would recommend to everyone, whether experienced with puzzle games or not."
6937,2567,..........BabaGame IS Good...........You
6938,2567,"Polished, indie, innovative puzzle game. I love it."
6939,2567,"This is a very different game from Hempuli's previous game, Environmental Station Alpha. However, it shares that game's unorthodox but interesting approach to game design. The premise is off-putting at first, but it quickly turns out to be loads of fun and tough to master. The soundtrack is a huge improvement over that from ESA, and in my opinion is worth the price of the game just by itself. My only gripes are that there's no story (though what story could justify what goes on?) and no hints."
6940,2567,The best puzzle game since Portal.
6941,2567,"I don't think I've ever been sold on something quicker than the first 15 seconds of the trailer. The game's delivered on that, though many puzzles have a lot of moving blocks around once you figure out the solution. Later on there are times when you feel like you've hit a brick wall, or have to think too much - the game is best when you're learning and experimenting with new mechanics. This can make finishing areas a bit of a drag, but the game is constantly introducing new ideas for it's entire run time. While $15 may seem high for the graphics and grid based mechanics, it's entirely worth it for the number of levels and ideas on display. I would recommend it if the trailer makes you at all interested."
6942,2567,"I have never played a puzzle game as engrossing as Baba is You. Each and every puzzle is a labor of love, and you can absolutely feel that while playing. The logic mechanics are astounding, reliable, and frustratingly easy to understand- and yet, I've never had a game challenge me as much as Baba does! You've got to do some very outside-of-the-box thinking to get through some of the puzzles. It's fantastic, and is already one of my favorite games. Wholeheartedly recommend."
6943,2567,Is good!
6944,2567,"""Baba Is You"" is a push-puzzle game based on rules. By pushing, you can change and break these rules. And each level is designed around doing just that. A simple concept that is the complex core of an amazing puzzle game that will change the way you think about solving puzzles.Hopefully, we'll get an editor so LEVEL is MORE.But for the many levels and puzzles that are given, YOU is THINK.Playing this game in small chunks and working with the rules, and discovering possible solutions for others in the process?TIME is MOVE.But what do I think about this game?""BABA is YOU"" is WIN."
6945,2567,BABA IS YOUREVIEW IS SPOILER
6946,2567,"Inventive, challenging, and addictive. If you love brain-burning puzzle games, this is for you! The aesthetic and sound are nice as well."
6947,2567,best puzzle game i've played since spacechem
6948,2567,Anyone who likes Stephen's Sausage Roll should try this game and vice versa.
6949,2567,"Out of all the games I've ever played, Baba Is You is easily among the best of the best. From concept to execution it's nothing short of a stroke of genius. Easy to understand yet extremely difficult to fully explain.The main idea is simple: It's a tile-based puzzle game where the specific rules of each level are determined by simple phrases, usually exactly 3 words in length much like the game's title. The words that make up these phrases are visible tiles within the level itself, and you can push said words around to rearrange them and alter the rules of the level as you see fit in order to complete it. The sheer magnitude of intrigue this simple concept produces is frankly completely nuts.Apart from the fantastic, challenging gameplay I just find the general aesthetic of the game to be incredibly pleasing. Graphically it has a certain balance of three familiar and minimal art styles which come to mind: ""chalkboard doodle"", ""ASCII graphics"", and ""ZX Spectrum graphics"" which give the game a certain coziness and readability. The game's music tends to be very atmospheric and relaxing on top of that, my personal favorites being Tree is Shift and Rocket is DustWhen all is said and done, the only thing this game really needs is a proper level creation tool, and thankfully the dev plans on adding one after a few tweaks and fixes are out of the way."
6950,2567,"The game is fun. If it's not fun, why bother. This one is hella fun."
6951,2567,"Very interesting puzzle, dazzling style complements it really well. Flawless Linux support is a cherry on top!"
6952,2567,"This is the best puzzle game to be released since The Witness. This game has the most ingenious uses of a core mechanic I've seen in a long time. The game never manages to feel repetitive either; every single level so far has surprised me in new ways. You will also be very hard-pressed to breeze through this game; the puzzles spike in difficulty very fast and stay consistently hard throughout the game. That said, most are never tear-your-hair-out difficult, and for the few that are, the non-linearity of the game allows you to skip any troublesome levels and come back later. This is the game everyone will be talking about in 2019. Play it now."
6953,2567,"It is exceedingly rare that I see a game that I'd recommend to virtually any game player.  Rarer still is when that game is a puzzle game.  This is such a game, which places it aside the Portal games and....not much else, frankly.The mechanics of the game are akin to sokoban.  You move your avatar around and push blocks until you achieve the win condition for each given map.  But it plays very differently, because the rules that define how the game functions are represented as sequences of blocks on the map.  And if you can reach those elements, you can push them around and change the rules of the map.  For instance, you might see the rule that ""WALL IS STOP"".  This means, as you might expect, that wall tiles will stop your character's movement...you cannot move through them.  But...if you simply push the ""STOP"" tile away from ""WALL IS""...walls will no longer stop your movement.  The resulting game ends up being an endless procession of clever and absurd puzzles where the entire of the puzzle changes as you alter rules left and right.  This DOESN'T, however, mean that the puzzles do not retain their challenge.   While  the initial puzzles are pretty easy, they soon become challenging enough to require some real thought.There are over two hundred puzzles in the game, and at the rate at which the difficulty increases I'd expect the endgame puzzles to be fairly brutal.  About the only gripe I can make with  this game is that it will end...an editor would be very nice (although I'm not entirely sure that there won't eventually be one, as the discussion boards hint that such a thing might be an outside possibility).  If you thoroughly DETEST puzzle games, you might want to stay away but otherwise I'd easily recommend this at its full price tag."
6954,2567,"If you liked the itch.io demo version, you'll love this. It's basically just more of the same kind of stuff, with all new ideas added into the mix. Excellent game."
6955,2567,BABA IS FUNTIME IS GONE
6956,2567,im playing way too much of this game im not even good at it the only puzzle game i've ever loved this much was portal

6958,2567,BABA IS PAINHASGAMEANDYOU
6959,2567,Not certain this game adheres strictly to constructs of modern EnglishBut it is simply syllogistically beautiful
6960,2567,"BABA is AMAZINGI was pretty hyped for Baba is You after playing the prototype (which you can still play for free if you need a small taste), but the full version managed to completely supersede these expectations. Baba is You surprises, makes you think and makes you feel clever (when you manage to solve the puzzle) consistently throughout the games. The cutesy simple artstyle manages to get the point through, and is perfect for this kind of game.You may think that the concept would get boring, but every world introduces new concepts/words and builds upon previous concepts, and every puzzle stays fresh. Some puzzles do feel a bit more like geometrical puzzles then logic puzzles, but there's so many puzzles that they don't feel dominant. Whatever you prefer, with the length of this game, you'll be sure to get your money's worth (200+ levels!).The biggest downside I can think of is that there aren't as many easier levels, so if you have trouble getting through puzzle games, the difficulty may be a bit too much of a spike. But at this pricepoint, the first few worlds alone are probably worth it. Also, the game is rather forgiving with the amount of levels you need to beat to complete a world, so you can always skip a few levels and go back to worlds later (I think I've unlocked most worlds, but I've only completed a few so far).It is probably one of the best puzzle games ever created, possibly the best. If you like puzzle games, you would be making a mistake in not trying it."
6961,2567,"Such a simple concept executed to perfection.  Easily the best puzzle game of the past few years, possibly the best game period over that same time frame.Imagine a Zachtronics game that doesn't hate you combined with the charm and character of Undertale."
6962,2567,I bought this game after watching Northernlion fail miserably to solve even the initial levels. Game Is Fun and you really have to think differently for each level. Plus there are a lot of levels set up on different themes.
6963,2567,BABA IS CUTE
6964,2567,Probably the hardest puzzle game I've ever played. Brain-meltingly good. I may not be able to 100% it but I damn will try.
6965,2567,Baba IS you AND fun.
6966,2567,"Baba is great! I don't typically play puzzle games, but Baba had me hooked the moment I saw it on Youtube. Baba applies simple controls with movable puzzle blocks that change the ""rules"" of the game. The rules can change everything from what you touch to win, if objects can be pushed, even to who You are! If you enjoy puzzles that scale in difficulty as your knowledge of the game does, Baba is perfect."
6967,2567,"BA   I   SM BA  S  ART ===   BA   I   GR===   BA  S  EATI've been waiting a year for this game and it's everything I'd hoped. There are definitely some puzzles where I'm smashing my head on my desk, but like all great puzzles, discovering the solution is a rush that can't be matched by any action game. I'm barely through the first half and I can wholeheartedly recommend it!There are a few ""echo"" puzzles, but really they are there to teach you solutions that are less obvious. BABA really expects you to get out of the box *very* early in the game. By the second world you have to use the [IS] block to transform [YOU] into different things. Each new mechanic is gently introduced, then you're thrown right into the mind-vice. A little program knowledge will help, but BABA is really about playful exploration. The backspace key is your friend! Take your time and find multiple solutions, try crazy things; you'll be surprised by what works and amazed with how you can use it. This is a truly unique game. Don't miss out. So, when's that workshop support coming, eh? :)"
6968,2567,Crazy puzzly fun for a code-oriented mind. Will drive you crazy.
6969,2567,Anyone who likes puzzles should definitely download Baba is You Probably the best game I've ever played
6970,2567,"Turns every rule of videogames on its head, over and over. Far and away the best puzzle game I have ever played."
6971,2567,"I haven't really read any of the other reviews here and honestly hadn't even heard of this game before a few days ago. That being said, not only is this game awesome it's absolutely ORIGINAL which in this day and age is extremely rare. As a sheep (i.e. ""Ba Ba"", get it?) it's your job to win each level by grabbing the flag. -Or is it? By pushing different sets of words around you alter the rules of the game in some very interesting and unique ways. Pushing the ""Flag"" block into the ""Baba"" block can change the sentence to ""Flag Is You"" and *poof* suddenly you're the flag moving around. That's but one very small example. Things get much more complicated as you go along, levels even start adding ""And"" into the mix to form complex rules. The logic, it's just amazing.Sure, you're always going to have a game that comes along that's ""the next Zelda"" or ""a bigger Mario"" but Baba is You is its own thing entirely. As a game dev myself I find it inspiring. P.S: Kudos for having a puzzle game that's genuinely difficult but in the best sort of way, never dumbing itself down to its audience and instead inviting the player to rise to each challenge."
6972,2567,"BABA ISfresh, refreshing, simple, beautiful, surprising, different, well thought, out of the box, mind blowing, awesome game design and variety.I showed this game to all my friends... Age, background and experiance... it doesn't matter with this game. Everyone finds themselves taken by the beauty and simplicity of it. Don't be fooled by the minimalist graphics, you stumbled on a jewel.Cheers to the dev (Hempuli) and all those that helped =)"
6973,2567,"BABA IS LOVEISLIFEGood game, would punch monitor again 18/10."
6974,2567,"A really good puzzle game where almost all the mechanics are on screen. These mechanics can be pushed/pulled/destroyed, altering how the game works and making a few simple statements spiral out of control in complexity.Having now finished the game, I can definitely say you get your money's worth. There's a lot of puzzles and they never run out of ideas."

6982,2567,"The feeling of accomplishment you get when solving even ""simple"" levels proves this is a good puzzle game."
6983,2567,"A very charming and clever puzzle game where all of its rules are statements that can be moved and switched around. Most levels start with the statement 'BABA IS YOU,' but what if WALL is you instead? or KEY, or FLAG, or LAVA? Is the flag out of reach? Make it so that a rock or jellyfish is the win condition instead.Like the greatest puzzle games, this one starts by introducing very simple rules and goals and gradually builds up. Each of its stages feels unique and often elicits chuckles just from the ideas and situations it presents. The levels start to become brain-teasers within an hour, and feel really satisfying when you finally complete them.In all, it does all the things that a puzzle game needs right, and I still have a lot of puzzles left to go."
6984,2567,"A sweet and cute game with extremely creative gameplay. The puzzles range from fairly easy/sandboxy to difficult, and will force you to change perspectives often to solve them.It boasts something like 200 levels, which give it an incredible amount of content for a 12.50 game.Highly recommended."

6991,2567,This is a great game. Very original. If you have any interest at all in puzzle games you should buy Baba is You.My only minor complaint is that it sometimes feels like it needs to throw some easier puzzles into the middle (and I assume later) zones. Multiple challenging puzzles in a row can feel a bit frustrating. I sometimes feel like I need a mental refresher to feel good before tackling the next challenge.

7000,2567,"BABA IS YOU is just brilliant. It's a twisted, mind-bending puzzle game where you have to rewrite the rules of the game (by pushing around blocks of text) to win. The graphics are charming, the music is great, and the puzzles are fiendish. There is often more than one way to complete a level, and the amount of lateral thinking required can be off the charts, but the game never feels unfair. Instead, finding a solution to a previously insoluble level is a 'Eureka' moment that is immensely rewarding.Highly recommended."

It's incredible how:- puzzles get harder and harder,- and yet they are NOT repetitive; every puzzle feels fresh and amazing,- and yet they are NOT frustrating; trying to solve them is fun even if we don't come up with a solution yet,- and solving them feels extremely rewarding.I find these are incredible qualities for a puzzle game."

Baba Is You has one of the most innovative puzzle concepts I have seen, and it is executed beautifully. The puzzles get very hard very fast, but the progression is set up perfectly.  As you reach harder puzzles, if you get stuck, you will have more and more options to go back and apply the things you have learned and keep making progress somewhere. Baba is you also sports a great chill soundtrack and adorable graphics.

7019,2567,"this game is lovely. i'm not usually a big fan of puzzle games - often times you need to complete them in a linear order, and if you get stuck on one you have no other recourse. baba is you, however, lets you tackle a bunch of different levels if you can't figure one out, with more being unlocked all the time. the difficulty progression is super tight, the music and graphics are charming, and of course the concept is as wonderful and as mind-bending as you could imagine, with lots of fun, inventive stages. i highly recommend it!"
7020,2567,A great puzzle game. One of those concepts that leads to endless puzzle possibilities that quickly get complex and satisfying to solve. Highly recommended for puzzle fans everywhere.
7021,2567,baba is good. baba is also hard.highly recomended.

7034,2567,"Baba Is Exceptional. I can't recommend this game enough, its incredibly versatile in its challenges and even more so in the possible solutions. To be succinct, the game is essentially Sokobon where the rules for the level are themselves little blocks, able to be pushed around.Baba can become a flag, a flag can become water, what sinks can be made to float, what floats can be made to be pushed... Baba can become a wall, a rock, a key, even the win condition itself. Baba is a thoroughly satisfying experience and I am very happy to see how well-received it is, Hempuli is a great dev!!"
7035,2567,"Good game. A lot of Sokoban games are more frustrating than fun for me, but I'm at 2 hours so far on Baba Is You and I'm very much enjoying it."

7043,2567,"Just didn't click for me. The core gameplay conceit is really appealing--I was a huge fan of Hack 'N' Slash by Doublefine--but these puzzles feel tedious and unintuitive.Maybe I don't like it very well because I despise Sokoban. Although it's unfair to say that this game is ""just"" indie Sokoban, it's undeniable that the logic of Sokoban or other tile sliding puzzles is prominently featured. As a silly example, all the ""fixed"" 3-block rules for a level are parallel and adjacent to walls, preventing them from being broken up. You'll constantly need to reason about ordering your moves in a way that feels unfortunately close to just playing Sokoban directly for me.I also feel like the puzzles are very unintuitive and I personally never got the feeling of satisfaction that some people report. Trying to understand the behavior of different properties interacting with each other didn't fill me with joy so much as a frustration that I needed to smash everything together in every combination to get a real sense of what the game designer intended. It's entirely possible my soul is immune to the joy of discovery, but I really hated this part of the game.Altogether it's very well-designed, with a lovely aesthetic and nice convenience features like infinite (and fast!) undo. I just wish I liked the puzzles better."

7045,2567,"Very interesting concept, infuriating and rewarding at once. Make you really think outside the box to solve puzzles."
7046,2567,this game is like drod (deadly rooms of death) but the puzzles are differnt. if u likle puzzle game where u walk around u like this game. no diagonial movement though and u have to bind the numpad manually but it ok other than that
7047,2567,"this is an exceedingly well put together puzzle game, almost all levels are very difficult, and require almost new directions to solve each of them, I've only fully cleared the first few stages, The Lake, Solitary Island, and a Forest of Fall (around 60, but man, this is an excellent puzzle game, Its hard to believe I'm not even close to halfway done)EDIT 1 : I am now 25 hours into the game, with 144 levels and 7 worlds 100% complete. Before I bought this game, I expected 5 hours of puzzles, then when i started, 10-15 hours, and now, I think i'll take maybe 40+ hours to beat the game (fully that is). This does very very VERY novel things, and very often uses novel and new ways to solve puzzles instead of repeating concepts.Towards where I am now, levels that aren't introductory now take an avg of 20-30+ mins, and are each generally rewarded with a satisfying OOHHHhbabaisgood."
7048,2567,"As of 100%ing my way through to world three (there are extra levels in each world you can skip), I think this sets a standard for how puzzle games should be made.I can't think of any cons, and here are my pros.I have a problem when games have rules they don't teach me, and I spend 30 minutes guess-and-checking until I stumble on what I'm supposed to do.>>I have so far always felt I had the tools to solve every puzzle, even if I have trouble piecing them togetherI love when a game's core mechanics are something I've never seen before.>>I haven't played anything like this, and I've played a hundred-something different flash puzzle games.I love when a game focuses on what makes it fun, and doesn't try to force too many ideas.>>This game focuses on what's fun about it.>>It has enough charm to have an identity, but not so much that it becomes distracted with trying to bring a world to life in place of the puzzlesNow I haven't beaten it but I'll addI dislike games that don't escalate in cleverness, but instead lengthen the sequence of actions you have to take to the point that you just can't keep track of everything.>>I'm only on world three, but so far, even the extra challenge levels have been solvable with a reasonable number of steps."
7049,2567,"Deceptively simple on the surface, incredibly difficult once you venture in. This game will make you feel like you're the dumbest person in the world, and once you figure it out you're a genius. Cute art style, exists to be more of a vessel to the puzzles rather than in the forefront. Lots of levels that will have you grasping for any sliver of a solution.10/10 Buy it full price, its worth it."

7052,2567,"A truly fantastic puzzle game with many original elements. There's less of a learning curve for a set of puzzles than The Witness, and the challenges are less sadistically cerebral than Stephen's Sausage Roll, yet still providing a reasonable challenge, making Baba is You easy to pick up, play a few puzzles, and put down (if you can tear yourself away from the game)."
7053,2567,"Makes me feel like an idiot for an hour, then a genius for a minute.10/10, buy this game."

7056,2567,"Well designed puzzle game, flows very well. Puzzles are logical, and consistent. Fun art style and music. Three thumbs up"
7057,2567,Baba is YouGame is Awesome
7058,2567,"A really clever puzzle game where you have to think outside the box. It's like Sokoban, except that you push around the rules of the game to change them. Kind of a Zachtronics-lite?"
7059,2567,"If you watched the trailer and thought ""Oh, that's a cool concept, I think this game is for me"" I have good news: This game is for you! Not only does the game explore what obvious things it can do with this sort of rules manipulation, it also explores plenty of non-obvious (and fun) ones. I'm only ~7 hours in so far and I look to have plenty of worlds and levels left to explore.The game also gets difficult quite quickly. After breezing through the few levels I was worried that if since I got the base idea, I wouldn't get challenged by the first few worlds. That wasn't an issue. Plenty of levels are difficult enough to get you stuck, but since you always unlock multiple levels ahead you are not *really* stuck without a way to progress. So A+ for the difficulty curve, something that indie puzzle games often can get wrong.I've been playing with a friend over voice chat by sharing my screen. Even though the game is single player, since most of the gameplay is *thinking* about what to do, it works well to play with friends next to you or by screen sharing. And if my friend sees something to try out on a level they can just tell me how to move.The graphics are what you see in the trailer, that is, not impressive at all. At times I wish there at least was an option to ""turn on anti-aliasing"", but yeah, you're not buying this game for its stunning graphics anyways. The soundtrack and sound effects are nice enough. I'm yet to get bored with the music, but if do I can just to turn it off and listen to some other music while playing since, (at least from the levels I've seen so far), the sounds aren't relevant to solving the levels.The only thing I really hope the developer adds in the future is support for a level editor letting us upload custom maps and level packs to the workshop."

7061,2567,KEKE > BABAChange my mind.
7062,2567,"One of the most creative puzzle games I've seen in a while. Has a great art style, a cutesy atmosphere peppered with some existential crises, and a fresh and original concept that is easy to understand but very hard to master. If you are bored and like puzzles, I can definitely say that this game is for you."
7063,2567,"I've been playing this for about three floors and it's wonderful so far. It's a refreshing puzzle game, for me at least, that sometimes really requires you to think about the solution. And yet, the concepts are pretty simple. 10/10."
7064,2567,"BA IS BE AND GO
BA    ST     TY"
7065,2567,"Baba is You is a game where rules are not just meant to be broken, but tampered, scrambled, and reconfigured. In it, you control a... white thing (except when you don't) and push rocks (except when you can't) around to reach the winning flag (except when it's something else).See, the rules of the game are also physical entities within the game. Turn something you push into the winning object, make solid walls into background noise, and even change what you're controlling, with the proper adjustments. Solving a level is not just how to move things around to reach the goal, but also how to change the rules to overcome obstacles.The rules themselves come with intuitive syntax: Colored words refer to objects, grey words are operative, and black words on colored tiles are properties. The game does a good job easing you into the logic of the world and teaching you how the rules work, then it grabs you by the ankles and chucks you into the deep end as each sub-area provides more twists and words to use and abuse in your quest to take the game apart by the seams.Progress is measured in little dandelion seeds and blooming flowers. Each completed level rewards you a seed, and each sub-area has a seed quota that will reward you with a flower. These flowers in turn, if you collect enough of them, will unlock gates on the map that lead to more levels and areas.The game also doesn't ask much for you to complete it. The maps are structured so that if you're having troubled with a level, there's likely other levels available for you to complete instead. Completed levels reveal all adjacent levels and sometimes tracks to another set of levels, so your options expand faster than you can usually exhaust them if you're getting stumped. In fact, though 10 sub-areas are available on the world map, you only need three flowers to access Level Finale and see the credits.You, however, are probably not going to pay $15 (or whatever this game is in local pricing) to beat roughly 25 levels in this game with more than 200 of them. Playing past the finale, you'll find that Baba is You still holds many levels and secrets, in keeping with the theme that the only thing that dictates the game are the rules, and those can change. Spoiling them will ruin the surprise, but some of the shenanigans it pulls are so clever I have to share them with someone. For now, I'll leave you with a cryptic observation.Say... why does the world map also have rules?"

7067,2567,nice puzzles
7068,2567,"""Baba is you"" is a unique 2.1d puzzle game that is truly addictive. I played a lot of puzzle game but I would say the puzzle in this game are the most humorous and well designed of all. Compare to the trivial puzzle in The Witness, this won't make me dizzy; compare to Stephen's Sausage Roll, this has much more interesting mechanics. It is hard to see such a puzzle masterpiece nowadays."
7069,2567,"I saw someone stream the gamejam build of this game and was instantly hooked on ""Baba is you"", As a programming student the logic to me is basically visualized programming logic with various if statements. Most levels can be solved several ways because there the win condition is based on internally changeable logic rather than a preset pattern. For 12 euro for 200 levels is an absolute steal."

7082,2567,"Brilliant game. I'm not a big fan of puzzle games as many of them become too complex and tedious after few levels. This one has managed so far to be challenging without being tedious.Why is that? Well in other puzzle games, as you advance they often present larger levels with more and more pieces to manipulate, past a certain point I end up moving them randomly until I get lucky or give up.On the other hand, this clever game has a manageable number of pieces to move around in a level, and you think hard until you find the trick that solves the puzzle, which is very satisfying."

7096,2567,"Baba is ExcellentBaba is You is a rule-based puzzle game developed by Hempuli Oy. Ive had this on my radar for a little while, and despite not being particularly good at puzzle games I knew this would be a day one purchase for me. The easiest way to understand how the game works is to watch the trailer, Im just here to tell you how bloody fantastic this game is (even if youre not particularly good at puzzles).Positives: The art and animations are quite simple, but I think they look great and suit the game. The colours are well selected Id say.The way puzzles work here is just fantastic. Baba is You works around rules. Each level has different rules, some can be changed, and some cant. The puzzles in this game are all about manipulating the rules youre presented with in order to meet the win condition (which in some cases you can change). The reason I like it all so much, is because the solution is always sitting in front of you. There are no hidden rules, and the game is quite good at teaching you new mechanics, you just have to figure out what to put where in order to win. Having everything on the screen in front of you also makes it a little less daunting for players who aren't as good at puzzle games, that's certainly the way I've felt with it.Baba is You makes you feel so incredibly smart when you finally finish a level. Even with the tutorial section at the beginning, I felt really good about solving the puzzles. I quite quickly reached a point where I was having a hard time with each level, but the satisfaction of beating a level is just great. I desperately want to beat this game, and its not often that I feel that way.Obviously Im nowhere near beating the game yet, but the level variety has been excellent so far. Not only that, but all of the levels have been consistently excellent. There is a lot of content here, according to the store page theres 200 levels and after three hours Im only 20 levels in. Im sure the time taken to beat each level continues to increase as you progress through the game as well. This really is one of those games that sticks with you. When I was playing this with my girlfriend last night, we got stuck on a particular level, and Ive been thinking about it since, trying to figure out a way I could make it work and beat the level. Again, there arent many games that stick with me that much.Baba doesnt have any kind of co-op mode or anything, but its great fun to play with a partner. As I mentioned, Ive played some of it with my girlfriend and it was really fun to try and figure out the levels together. And because Baba has quite a simple, rule-based premise, its really easy for other people to pick up. In fact, my girlfriend was immediately better at solving the puzzles than I was.As well as giving you the ability to reset you can undo moves too! This is super helpful, especially for the longer levels. It's really easy to push a word into a place where you can't move it, having undo has saved me a lot of restarts.10% of the money that the dev earns from the game goes to charity, givingwhatwecan.org to be precise. Not often you see something like that outside of HumbleBundle, I think its great that the dev is donating some of his earnings from this. Negatives:This is purely because Im bad at puzzle games, but I feel like having some kind of hint system would have been a good inclusion. Perhaps triggered by spending a certain amount of time on one level. I dont want to have to look up the solutions to levels, but occasionally I would have liked a hint. This is really minor, but the cursor doesn't disappear despite not being used whether you're playing KB or gamepad. I just find that annoying.Verdict:Baba is You is absolutely fantastic, and most definitely one of the best puzzle games Ive played. I love the rule-based puzzles and its one of those games that I cant stop thinking about. If you have ever enjoyed a puzzle game, then this is an absolute must have, even at full price. This is certainly an early consideration for my personal game of the year title. JUST BUY IT!If you found this review helpful, please consider following my curator page: Kemo's Corner."

7113,2567,BABA IS YOU AND SHINY
7114,2567,"This game challenges you to think outside the box.. then then cube... then the hypercube.  What seems like a simple gimmick at first leads to some mind-blowing puzzles, and some very surprising behavior from the game.The whole idea of the game is that the level's rules are made up of pushable pieces of text, allowing you to re-write the rules of the game and transform the entire level by declaring that all the walls are now keys, and all the grass is now lava.  The levels are often structured to limit you in ways that will force you to solve at least part of the puzzle a certain way, still forcing you to think rather than find one win-all solution.. however, you can imagine that times when you are allowed a lot of freedom with the rules, surprising and strange solutions will reveal themselves to clever players.Some of the challenge stages are really quite diabolically hard, but you will feel SO good when you solve them, and finally get that achievement for clearing an entire area.  Most of the regular stages are quite do-able once you get a handle on what kinds of things do and do not work.May add more to the later if I think of it.  For now, just know that this is a very worthwhile game.  Probably will be best indie puzzler of the year in my book.  Highly recommended."
7115,2567,"Baba is FunBaba is GoodUser is BuyI am not one to usually pick up puzzle games, however when I saw the trailer for baba it caught my eye because of it's simplistic and cute style. It's no doubtedly a game that had me pulling out my hair trying to figure out what to do, even in the early levels, but the amount of ""aha"" moments I had in this game already gave me it's moneys worth, and it's something I definitely plan on seeing to the end."
7116,2567,BABA IS LIFEISLOVE
7117,2567,"""Baba Is You"" is a tile pushing puzzle game with a twist: Words like object names, adjectives, and conjunctive verbs are also tiles and can be placed next to each other to form sentences. These sentences, like ""Rock is push"" change the behavior of all rocks on the screen and allow the player to push the rocks around until the sentence is broken. All objects (except words) must have rules to have any meaning. The modifier ""You"" must be in a sentence for you to be able to move anything. And you can move anything. If you push together the sentence ""Baba and Wall is you"" then every wall in the stage will match your characters movements. If it isn't clicking yet, don't worry. It will. And when it does, you get to puzzle in ways you never would have though possible. You're playing with the games logic while playing the game and using that power to solve puzzles. It's creative, it's challenging, and it's brilliant.I cannot stress enough how much every person needs to play this game. It's not a masterpiece by any means, but it's simple and addictive enough that it will probably be cited in years to come as a prime example of good game design.9/10. Highly recommended."

It's really challenging, but very rewarding.  The visuals are cute and goofy, which is fitting for when you turn into a wall. The music is just the right style of beeps and boops that doesn't get too repetitive.10/10, I am a crab now."

7127,2567,"Every single level, usually, runs like this:1/ try to figure it out2/ eventually manage to do so3/ call myself an idiot for not realizing it sooner4/ repeat at the next levelI love it. The ""rule"" system is quite innovative and interesting to tinker with. Levels progress in difficulty and build on previously established concepts. If you can't solve a puzzle, try looking at previous levels for hints on concepts you haven't considered.Baba Is GoodGame"
7128,2567,Really something special
7129,2567,"Absolutely recommended. I've been following this game's progress for a while and now that it's out and I've played it, there are so many wonderful a-ha moments when solving these puzzles that it's a must-play for anyone who likes brain exercise."
7130,2567,Baba is buy!
7131,2567,This game has some of the most hilarious existential horror I've ever experienced. Would recommend.
7132,2567,"I don't like soundtrack. Everything else is a masterpiece, such a great concept!"
7133,2567,One of those landmark puzzle games that blows your mind and brings out your inner genius. Buy it.

7145,2566,Quite simply one of the most brilliantly designed games I've ever seen.
7146,2566,Phenomenal game!Unique mechanic that requires creative thinking & brings out silly momentsGreat soundtrackFun wobbly style
7147,2566,GAME IS HARDHARD IS GREATGREAT IS WORTHWORTH TO BUY
7148,2566,Start with a base of Sokoban and add in a extra layer of having to think outside the box at times and you will end up with this cool puzzle game.  Totally recommended.
7149,2566,The wobble and zoom effects hurt my eyes but can be turned off. The game itself has a pleasant difficulty curve and also offers optional difficult levels early on. Game is Good.
7150,2566,"I think the best thing about Baba is You is that it relies on simple rules- that you can change the rules- and yet manages to provide you several different types of puzzles.There are a lot of puzzles which are quite easy and obvious. However, there are also the extremely difficult puzzles. The puzzles you'll get stuck on, and you'll leave the game, and you'll come back to it, and repeat it a few times before you get it right.Each of these puzzles is different entirely. The thinking you use for solving one puzzle can't apply to the next. The kind of puzzle it is changes.Best of all, this somehow makes this puzzle game replayable. Of the most difficult puzzles, I might solve it one day, and then come back the next day, revisit the puzzle, and have completely forgotten both the solution and the thought process that led me to it. I have to relearn that way of thinking entirely to solve the puzzle, only one day after having solved it in the first place.This game is simply a masterpiece."
7151,2566,"Really interesting sokoban game about manipulating rules. It really gets you thinking about solving things in a very unique way: rather than ""how can I reach the solution state?"" it's ""what solution state do I want to make?"" There are a lot more levels than I was expecting!"
7152,2566,"(BABA) {IS} [GOOD]Baba Is You is a deceptively simple puzzle game. (BABA) {IS} [YOU] and you control [YOU] with the arrow keys on a two-dimensional field. All you have to do is get to [WIN]. Simple.The distinction, of course, is you control [YOU]. (BABA) {IS} [YOU], but what if (WALL) {IS} [YOU]? Well, you'll control walls. And if (BABA) {AND} (WALL) {IS} [YOU]? Well you control Baba and the walls. See, the properties of all the objects in the game are objects themselves, able to be pushed and manipulated by [YOU]. (LAVA) {IS} [DEFEAT]? Just push away the {IS} and walk across the lava. (FLAG) {IS} [WIN], but the flag is unreachable? Push in an object and make it (LAVA) {IS} [WIN], then touch any spot of lava to win the level.The simplicity of the concept, but the complexity of the interactions is what makes Baba Is You a great puzzle game. There's no obscure properties to remember, 'gotchas' of game minutiae that you'll only figure out by reading a walkthrough. The only thing to really remember is you move [YOU], and all other properties are subject to change, stated at the start of each level. You could go away for two months, and return to Baba Is You and still have a good idea on how to solve the puzzles presented.The ability to change the rules is why (BABA) {IS} [GOOD]. But the interactions is why (BABA) {IS} [GENIUS].For example, you may not be able to change (WALL) {IS} [STOP]. It's pushed against the edge of the level, and can't be separated. But the properties themselves are still objects. You can use that (WALL) and push in {IS} [FLOAT] to walk under the walls. (WATER) {IS} [SINK], (ROCK) {IS} [PUSH], but there's only one rock? Go ahead and push (ROCK) {IS} [PUSH] into the water to make a bridge; [SINK] takes any object after all. What if (DOOR) {IS} [SHUT] {AND} [OPEN]? What if (TEXT) {IS} [DEFEAT]? What if (BABA) {IS} (BABA)?While interactions with objects and their properties are near endless, the baseline mechanics of the game remain simple, and what the properties actually do remain static. Because of this, all the interactions you learn within the game come naturally, rather than feeling forced. This allows the game to stay approachable and intuitive, while still allowing a great amount of depth and complexity to the puzzles presented.If you're looking for a puzzle game that you can either binge in one day, or play an hour or so across a month, Baba Is You makes for a great pickup in both cases.Just make sure that, at all times, something, anything, {IS} [YOU]."
7153,2566,"Easily one of the best puzzle games I've played in a good while. What a great concept, what great puzzles."
7154,2566,"Baba Is You has the same ingenious take on puzzles as 'Portal' did. Not necessarily in the physical sense, the gameplay is push and rewind-like but using words makes you feel like Dragonborn from Skyrim, you start thinking with...words? It's so interesting! Also the oddly melancholic soundtrack combined with beautiful artstyle makes this a very homely experience while you scratch your head at the impossible combinations of words required to beat every level."
7155,2566,"Baba Is You is a deceptively simple game. The store page and plenty of other reviews do a good enough job explaining how it works, but what they leave out is how well the game takes advantage of the rules. There are games I've played with amazing concepts that were poorly executed, but Baba knows exactly what it's doing. While a fair number of the puzzles are pretty introductory, the difficulty steadily increases as you play the game and the puzzles at the end of each ""world"" force you to use what you've learned about the game rules earlier on to think outside the box.The best puzzle games make you think about things in ways you wouldn't before, and Baba does this in spades. I can't think of any other game that gives you the ability to rewrite the way the game works, and it would have been successful if it had just left it at that. The fact that Hempuli has made so many levels that knock it out of the park turns what would be a great game into an amazing one."
7156,2566,"BABA is YOU and CUTEPretty cute game, I like the art. The gameplay is pretty inventive, you push blocks with words on them, and those words are the "" rules "" for that stageso most stages have BABA is YOU , so you're controlling the little white fluffy thingthen you have other things like ROCK is PUSH, so you can push rocksbut the fun comes in moving the words in unexpected ways, like ROCK is YOU , and now you control all the rocks on the screenOr maybe you change the win condition of FLAg is WIN to BABA is FLAG and on the same thing, goign down you can put BABA is WIN, so now the flag is baba, and you instantly win the level haha. another fun moment was WALL is YOU, and suddenly, i'm moving the entire wall structure in the level, drowning pieces of it as I get to the FLAg is WIN lolwith 200 levels, and a solid fun concept, you're going to get a lot out of this. It reminds me of games liek Scribblenauts, where there's an obvious way to solve the puzzles, and then ways you wouldn't think would work - half of the fun is in experimenting to see just what you can do .absolutely recommend this one, played for an hour - felt like I played for 10 minutes , a good sign that I enjoyed myself; as the saying goes "" time flies when you're having fun """
7157,2566,You is walletWallet is cashcash is gamegame is you.Get the game if you like changing the rules!
7158,2566,"Game is Brillo. Money Is Worth. Player Is Happy.Truly, this game is a puzzle masterpiece. The elements in the levels range from many to few and yet the easier levels are usually the ones with more stuff. I am about 30 levels in at the point of writing this and I have to say: all levels are brilliant, some are really hard, all of them are fair.Baba Is You is best at what makes a puzzle game great: figuring out a different way than intended by the developer.I cannot recommend it enough. I'd also like to add that this game is severely underpriced. It's a shame that indie devs are expected to sell at maximum 20 and people will still wait for sales.I encourage you not to wait for a sale. This guy deserves it."
7159,2566,"A very cool game to try when you're not really in the mood for blasting, hopping or just mindlessly slugging it out with fantastical foes.  Visuals are crude but effective doing the job with the minimal amount of fuss.   Meshing words with concepts and bending it a bit to get the desired result is a great way to stave off mind decay for a bit each day.  Im not sure if this thing comes with an editor but that could surely be fun if it does.  Trying to see what you can cook up after you've finished the game would be a great deal more value for an already great game.  Try it without regret."
7160,2566,Baba is goodBaba is hardBaba is trickyBaba is worth itBaba is best
7161,2566,"Great puzzle game.Manipulate logic to change rulesets of each puzzle.Starts simple, but gets complex quite quickly.Also, it's kind of funny and full of surprises (loved the poem)"
7162,2566,"Very relaxing and nice, I've been following the dev's work for a while and it's definitely worth the price! I'm very bad puzzle game though so I'll have to wait for hint pages or walkthroughs to help me out..."
7163,2566,"Baba Is You is an unique, accessible puzzle game. Though adhering to standard sokoban design, the puzzles (at least those I've played so far) require more lateral and creative thinking. There are many times when the game breaks with conventional game design making you question the social contract between you and the designer. (It's thematically meta in that way.) As a result, puzzles are not fiddly and intimidating but simple and fun.  Baba Is You is a game I'd recommend to someone who doesn't play puzzle games regularly and, hell, even someone who doesn't play games regularly; it's just that good."
7164,2566,"Finally released! Never before have I played a puzzle game that was so simple to learn but so tough to master, and not because of traditional difficulty, it's rather quite logical. But you need to think outside the box. I believe the trailers should prove self explanatory but the tl;dr is this:You change the rules of the game as you play it, but sometimes changing the rules is difficult.Regardless, this game is brilliant, a timely release with no early access with a fair price and 10% goes to charity? I'll buy this game again any day, great work devs!"
7165,2566,Very Solid and fun puzzle game
7166,2566,Baba Is Good
7167,2566,"15$  IS  STEALSeriously, one of the best puzzle games I've ever played.  I rarely write reviews but I've been hyped for this game ever since playing the earlier demo that *deservedly* won a ton of awards when it first came out.  I would even say this game is priced too low for all the content it offers.  If you're even remotely on the fence, a level editor is in the works guaranteeing a ton of fan made levels when you finally do beat the game (and with a generous 200+ levels that should still take a fairly good amount of time to play through).Did I mention you need to buy this?  Yeah, you need to buy this.  10/10, 5/5 Stars, A++++, etc...   Thank you, Hempuli, for making such a great game."
7168,2566,Baba is You is a perfect fit for those who like when a game gives you a simple mechanic and build so many things on top of that. You will be surprised what this game has to offer. If you are into puzzle games it's a must have. Truly innovative experience.
7169,2566,"Very inventive puzzler with unique ""rules"" mechanic that is super flexible. According to the devs even the primary mechanics are implemented using the in-game ""rules"" system.Chill soundtrack.Simple but aesthetically pleasing graphics.Highly recommend."

7176,2566,MOOVRY IS REVIEW AND RECOMMENDBABA IS YOU  ISBUY
7177,2566,"After playing for a few hours (after waiting for what felt like a few years), my initial impressions are pretty positive. Suitable challenge, plenty of options in how to approach puzzles, full of creative ideas and room for creative solutions.Easily recommend to anyone that likes playing puzzle games."
7178,2566,"got stuck on several puzzles, have never been this enthralled with puzzle game, baba is me and love 10/10 my brain is 9 times larger than when i started."
7179,2566,"I'm calling it now, Baba is You is my GOTY 2019. I mean that earnestly, no other puzzle game has ever made me happier.If you aren't sure if this would be for you or not, this concept originated at Nordic Game Jam 2017 and that early concept version of the game is still available as a free download that you can treat as a demo for this retail release."
7180,2566,"In the 30 minutes I've played already, I can already tell that this is one of the most innovative puzzle games in years. It's a mix between the 2D positioning based puzzles in games such as Steven's Sausage Roll, and the ""coding"" / word positioning puzzles found in Dan Mullins' Pony Island. Nothing is set in stone. YOU can be anything. You can win by anything. You can die by anything. You can be anything.... and anything can be you. Levels are so well crafted, many have multiple ways to complete them, if you're willing to go the extra mile to figure them out. I highly recommend this to any puzzle game fan."
7181,2566,Baba is hard
7182,2566,"Baba Is You is a really interesting concept for a puzzle game! The base game itself is really nice, with an unusual concept based on rewriting the rules of the game as you play it. You might think that would get old eventually but there's a surprising amount that can be done with that idea and the game does a good job of exploring every aspect of it.A huge condition for me in terms of deciding whether or not I like a puzzle game is the difficulty and the ratio of fun to frustration. This game definitely has some puzzles that are frustrating at times, but it's balanced perfectly by having a lot of possible directions to go at once so even if you're stuck you can almost always try something else for a bit and come back. And some alternate paths will provide insight that will help solve previously difficult puzzles too. In all, this is my favorite puzzle game I've played in a long time!"
7183,2566,"It's a block pushing puzzle.It turns out that when the rules of the game are the blocks you can push, breaking them and mixing them into new sentences that change the rules of the game, the game becomes creative, mindbending, and satisfying in ways that a block pusher rarely is. The block pusher, one of the oldest computerized puzzle game genres, has been reinvented into something truly brilliant, decades after its inception. Absolutely not to be missed.Caution: It is easy to spend much more time than you meant to playing this game."
7184,2566,"KEY is OPEN and PUSH, and DOOR is SHUT and STOP. Okay, I'll open the door with the key, consuming the key.Now BABA is YOU and OPEN, and WATER is SHUT. Okay, I'll open the water with myself...? Wait now I'm dead since I consumed myself.Now COG is OPEN and PUSH, and CRAB is SHUT. Okay, now I don't have to open the crab because it's only SHUT, not STOP.Now FLAG is OPEN and PUSH but there's no flags in the puzzle anyways. But if I write STAR is FLAG, now there are."
7185,2566,"Such an imaginative setup.   I love pushing the words around and seeing what happens.  ""Water is Text"" and suddenly the screen is covered with text saying ""water"".  <grin>"
7186,2566,"Absolutely delightful puzzle game.  Every rule is simple on its surface and tricky in practice.  Difficulty curve is just about right to make you think for a minute then arrive at the answer.  There's very, very little hand-holding, every puzzle feels like a challenge even when they're obviously trying to teach you a new mechanic.  It teaches you by setting up the puzzles for an a-ha moment rather than telling you the solution to a simple puzzle.The ""extra"" stages, which are optional, can be absolute stumpers.  Feels awesome to solve them, but don't expect it to be easy.Lastly, the soundtrack is EXCELLENT.  Good, throbby, thinky basslines.  This is the best puzzle game I've played in years.  Up there with the trickier parts of Braid in how it makes you think about the tools at your disposal.Here's how much I dug this: I bought it twice!  These kind of levels are perfect for playing on the go on Switch, and there's several people I want to show it to."
7187,2566,To play this game is to alternate rapidly between smiling like an idiot and feeling like an idiot. It's wonderful.
7188,2566,"I'm normally not one for puzzle games, because I'm dumb as a rock, but this game is just so charming.  I saw the demo in a GDQ event awhile ago, downloaded it off Itchio and been looking forward to it ever since.  $15 is a steal for this clever, adorable little puzzle game where you change the game rules by arranging words in order to win.  Have the flag (with Flag is Win) surrounded by walls but the walls have Walls is Stop?  Remove Stop and walk right past to the flag!  The puzzles have a nice variety, they add more words, such as ""And"" (So you can have Baba is You and Float)  to add to the challenge, and some of the special challenges remind me that I'm an idiot but I'm loving every minute of it. TL:DR:  Highly recommended if you like puzzle games, maybe even if you don't."
7189,2566,Good game
7190,2566,"Been following Hempuli for a while on twitter and twitch, watching as he kept posting updates for this game, i tried to avoid watching the gameplay videos. I have to say that at  first it felt a bit like Adventures of Lolo for the NES. And then it just turned into something else. It's a very clever puzzle game and it's clearly made with love."
7191,2566,"A rather unique puzzle game that includes the rules and the ability to change them as part of the puzzle solving. It twists your mind in all the right ways and has tons of levels to complete. It works like one of my other most favorite puzzle games, The Witness, where every puzzle has a simple concept, then it slowly starts opening more and more ideas to you until you're like.. well, what ISN'T possible?"
7192,2566,"Baba Is GreatIf Baba is you was just the first half of the game, it would be an amazing puzzle game with an amazing ideaBut the second half of the game / the lategame stuff elevates it to one of the best puzzle games of all time"
7193,2566,"A couple years ago I downloaded this strangely named title from itch.io on a whim.  Looked like a dopey little block-pushing game I could kill a few minutes with, and hey, it was free.What I found was one of the most brilliant puzzle games I'd ever come across.  Along with a promise that some day, at an unknown date in the future, there'd be a fuller, more fleshed out version. Today is that glorious day, and it's as great as I'd hoped.  Which means it was as great as the original, just so much more.  If you like puzzles, particularly ones that tax and reward your lateral (and literal!) thinking skills to their utmost, this is as good as you're going to find, and it's all presented in a very likable, relaxing way, which is good, because like all great puzzle games, occasionally you will want to pick your monitor up and bash it repeatedly on the closest hard surface.A masterpiece.  What are you doing?  Why aren't you playing it yet?"

7200,2566,"Simple, elegant and fiendishly clever puzzler."
7201,2566,"Baba is You is deceptively simple - you'll breeze through the early levels, get to grips with the mechanics, and then spend thirty minutes just staring at a single screen which, using those very same mechanics, will give you a headache and make you want to tear your hair out all at once. As soon as you think you've seen everything that the mechanics can do, you'll need to flip your thinking entirely on its head in order to figure out the next level. Finish a level? What if that same level had one minor change, a block here rather than there?Baba is Brilliant. Baba is Difficult. Baba is You."
7202,2566,Very interesting concept and a great game.
7203,2566,"Not even an hour after opening and you'll see that it's hands down one of the most well designed puzzle games ever. The aesthetic is immediately striking with the goofy word choice, chirpy synths, and constantly moving images; it's absolutely adorable. The puzzles themselves are governed by rules that are very easy to understand, but become deceptively deep and nuanced as they get layered on top of each other. The presentation and puzzle design is top notch, they're incredibly challenging but never to a frustrating point. The non-linearity proves you'll never truly get stuck and it remains accessible for younger people, while difficult enough for more experienced players. I could go on all day, but it's truly an instant classic."
7204,2566,Brain IS Hurt.
7205,2566,"What I find crazy about Baba Is You is that it could have been a console game in the 90s... in that a programmer could have created it with the technology of the time. Yet somehow, it's completely, utterly fresh. It looks like the past, and feels like the future.Instant classic. 10/10."
7206,2566,"An excellent puzzle game with an extremely creative concept. In Baba is You, the player solves puzzles by changing the very rules of the game using small movable nouns in the world. This involves altering the identity of the player character, changing the properties of objects in the world, or even giving yourself the WIN condition in order. $15 for this game is practically a steal."
7207,2566,"At its most basic, it's a puzzle game about pushing things around.  Most importantly, however, those 'things' can include words.  And those words, when formed into statements, actually define the world around you.  So long as WALL IS STOP is aligned, then walls will stop you.  Move any piece of that, though, and it's no longer true.  Make WALL IS YOU and suddenly you are controlling every single wall on the map when you move.  ...That's the kind of game this is.  Simple but brilliant and guaranteed to make you have to relearn how to think - the exact way that a good puzzler works.tl;dr : BRAIN IS HURT"
