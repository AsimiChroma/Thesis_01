Gameplay and art design felt like a mashup of SpaceChem and TIS-100, and as those were two great games I very much enjoyed, there was certainly fun to be had here in advancing through the puzzles and optimizing my solutions. It's a double-edged sword though, as there were aspects of MOLEK-SYNTEZ that I thought were executed much better in SpaceChem (eg actually having control of when reagents enter the chamber), and reusing the exact same menus and progression from TIS-100 made it feel like the author was either rushed or couldn't be bothered to give this game a theme and soul of its own.I'd still definitely recommend this game if you're a die-hard Zachtronics fan, but wouldn't say it's worth full price if you've played the previous games I've mentioned, as a lot of what's here you'll have already seen before, arguably done better.

1168880,0,0,kschang77,483,352,1,15.5,"March 9, 2021","Molek-Syntez is a quintessential Zachtronics game where you try to make chemicals with up to 6 manipulators using some precursor chemicals, and you are rated for minimal waste, as well as speed. However, the lack of a manual and the super-plain monochrome UI may be a bit off-putting compared to its flashier cousins like SpaceChem or even Opus Magnum. You are asked to program the synthesizer to make variety of chemicals. There is a primary series, and a set of ""additional puzzles"" to keep you going. There is a thin backstory, as the chemicals you make starts pretty innocent, but soon goes into... some questionable pharmaceuticals. The game is challenging in that you have to move on a hex field, but your manipulators are on the OUTSIDE looking in, so it can only affect something it is pointing at directly, without something in the way. You mainly deal with chemicals by adding or removing hydrogen items. You can remove something by adding enough H so it becomes a standalone, or move H to force it to bond with something nearby. There is even a shunt function that can push the H onto the next molecule over. You can also move your emitters left and right, as well as pull or push. The trick of course, is how are you going to divide up the cutting and pasting necessary to create the proper molecule you need with just the precursor chemicals you have, as well as move them into position so they can bond properly, AND do it in the minimum number of steps/cycles. Whilee there is the typical historgram, somehow the bare minimum UI just doesn't feel as... engaging. It's recomemnded if you like the genre, but players new to the genre should play SpaceChem or Opus Magnum instead."

This game is much more constraining in terms of what the player can do. There is limited instruction space, and you can only have a limited number of arms. Even those arms must always be on the edge and cannot rotate. I think this leads to more of a barrier on ""passing"" a level, which I prefer to games that feel like most of the challenge is in the optimization. That isn't to say that this game is hard (it is definitely much easier than some of Zachtronics early games), but it does change the way that you approach the problems and makes it more likely that you will need to completely restart a bad solution.This game is mostly about taking things apart. The inputs on all of the problems are much more complex than in Opus Magnum. The main consequence of this is that you end up with fuller boards without needing to go through the sometimes tedious early process of creating the large pieces that need to be manipulated.The gifs that this game makes are also very nice; a good advantage over something like TIS-100"

It does however do a relatively good job at teaching atom economy in an abstract way! Zach-likes are great because they actively demonstrate and challenge you to come up with multiple solutions to a problem. There are so many different ways to look at in terms of making them more efficient - I love how ridiculously slow the 1 emitter solutions are when you play back the GIFs and videos posted online.

I found them to be interesting on the main campaign, it gives you a good feel when solving it, though it's not as nice as in Opus Magnum where it also looked so good while running your algorithm. Definitely recommend this for puzzle fans.I found the solitaire minigame to be super good, though not as good as Opus Magnum's minigame, and that's one thing that I (shame on me) usually don't play much on Zachlikes. It feels challenging without being unfair. After playing a while you get the hang of it, and when you lose, it's usually your fault and not just pure bad luck.I'd say this is a toned down version of Opus Magnum in every aspect: gameplay, minigame, style, story.

The limited size of the grid, and the fact that the ""arms"" (called emitters in this game) can only move on a fixed rail pointing to a fixed direction gives this game a lot of challenge.

For people who haven't played any Zachtronics gameThis game is about programming a molecule synthesizer to produce various stuff.

That's not to say they game is too easy, or not fun: It has the same addictive problem solving as prior games, it's just the ease of coming up with that first quick (to build) solution that's different. If you've struggled to complete prior Zach games (I'm guilty here) then it means this one is more satisfying, but the real trick with these games has always been *optimizing* your solution along one or more metrics (cycles, instructions, modules, etc.) That's no different here. If anything, the (relative) ease of coming up with *something*, *anything* as long as it gets the job done is more than offset by a much increased difficulty in optimizing a solution. In Opus Magnum, for example, it was often more difficult to come up with an initial solution, but somewhat easier than Molek to optimize.And as with many Zach games, there's a unique & challenging solitaire game built in. It could be I'm just awful at it, but it seems like there are more ""no possible solution"" deals than some of the others.Anyway, it's a good game. If you've liked the past games, you'll probably like this one. If you *wanted* to like the past games but hit a wall on difficulty halfway through, you'll probably like this one more. If you've hated all parts of the past games, you should ask yourself why you're wasting so much time looking at this one, reading reviews, etc. You should find better things to do with your time than read mostly positive reviews about things you hate.

It's like Opus Magnum except with a limited puzzle field, limited inputs, and the manipulating arms sitting on the outskirts rather than wherever may be most convenient. It's got a higher but still reasonable difficulty curve, and as always you can chase various optimizations.My problem with this one is entirely in the presentation. In spite of how well it works, the environment is as drab and featureless as TIS-100. Manipulating the puzzle pieces with invisible rays from the borderlines is a lot less engaging than arms that tangibly grab and move the pieces around. Completed compounds don't slip into a designated export with a satisfying ""clunk"", they simply blip out of existence with no visual differentiation to deleted atoms. And perhaps most egregiously, you unlock all the pieces you'll be using through the main campaign after the first few levels which completely kills the sense of progression, especially after Opus Magnum did such an amazing job of gradually unveiling more and more devices to work with. I just feel like I'm solving the same puzzle over and over again with a slowly escalating complexity which has completely killed my drive to progress. Doesn't help that there's even less story to follow than usual.By all means I'd recommend it if you're more tolerant of grey, drab, sterile environments and overly static elements in your puzzle games. I guess that's a combination that really puts me off."

If you haven't played any zachlike before, go play Opus Magnum and then come back here. The game is a solid recommendation for anyone familiar with these games though.As others have said, this game is mechanically closest to Opus Magnum, but takes the real-world chemistry roots (and limited play field) from SpaceChem, and the minimalist (and monochrome) presentation from TIS-100. Just beating the levels is on the easier side of the spectrum (really not much or any harder than Opus Magnum) but the game has a huge amount of optimisation depth, as early as on the second level. I beat the main campaign in 7 hours, but could probably spend another 100 to optimise all the scores, maybe 200.As all recent Zachtronics games, there's also a solitaire minigame you unlock quite early on. It's another Freecell-like, but a fairly fun one. There are no actual free cells, but you can dump single cards anywhere, at the cost of not being able to use that stack, and not being able to move that card except to a valid location.Anyway, if zachlikes are your jam, get this game.

It plays similar to Opus Magnum, but you slide the atoms around instead of grabbing them directly. Atoms will fuse together depending on how many bonds they have, which you indirectly control with your emitters. It took me some trial and error before I fully understood how it worked, but it's lots of fun once you get the hang of it.Compared to previous Zachtronics games, MOLEK-SYNTEZ is relatively short. But if you're the type of person that likes to optimize their solutions, you'll certainly get many hours of enjoyment out of it. But if not, you may find you've run out of puzzles sooner than you expected. However the game is still in early access, so more puzzles will most likely be added eventually. Sadly there is currently no Steam Workshop support, so there are no user-made puzzles. Which is a shame, since it seems like that would be a perfect fit for this game.MOLEK-SYNTEZ is a great little game, but given its shortness it might be better to get one of Zachtronics' other games instead, if you haven't played them already.

It feels like he got too focused on the 'science' aspect of things, and not enough on actually making a fun game.My main issue, is that the puzzles don't feel like puzzles. Once you look at a puzzle, you can instantly tell what you need to do. And everything past that is just trying to get the modules to cooperate. Usually, this means shooting hydrogen at everything you don't like until it's isolated, deleting it, then mashing everything else together. Occasionally, you'll rotate a module one way or another... in fact, let's go over the different commands:Rotate molecule clockwise/counter clockwise: Two different commands, you'll almost never need either of them since you can place molecules freely into the play area, including rotation.Push/pull molecule: For mashing things together. Decently useful, but not really interesting.Move module: Moving modules? Clearly you're doing something wrong. Or at least, that's the general feeling every time you need to use this command.Add Hydrogen: Deal 1 damage to an enemy atom. (Or at least that's what it tends to feel like)Delete: Kill an enemy atom that has been reduced to 0 HP.Remove Hydrogen: Yay, this atom can form bonds now- no, no don't bond to that! Guess I need another four completely empty instructions while something else moves into position.Shunt hydrogen: First of all, it looks almost identical to the add hydrogen instruction, which is annoying. As for if it's good or not... it's okay? It's basically just 'do two things in one instruction'.Submit product: Okay.It basically feels like Zach wanted to create a simplified version of spacechem, and wound up simplifying away all the actually fun parts. I hesitate to say outright that it's 'bad', but honestly, if you have any other Zachtronics game that you haven't tried yet, get that one first."

Their games cover such a range of puzzle difficulties and mechanics that you run the risk of evaluating them too early.  That said, we have some points of comparison here that allow us to say things about MOLEK-SYNTEZ.Other reviewers have described this as a cross between TIS-100 and Opus Magnum.  I believe the TIS-100 similarities are largely just on the surface - the UI, the color palette, the very oblique story.  In terms of game mechanics, comparing this to Opus Magnum is on point - I'd say ""Opus Magnum crossed with SpaceChem"" is more accurate.  The ""waldos"" you use in this game have a slightly different set of operations.  Unlike Opus Magnum, the arena in which you operate is finite, which certainly increases the difficulty level.I'm enjoying the game, but - as with SpaceChem - at this point I can already see the point where it will become too difficult for me.  I have a friend who, when I suggest Zachtronics games to them, demurs with ""I already have a job.""  I think that's a fair response.

Keybindings were a bit wonky, but nothing too bad.I also get the movement direction wrong all the time, I'm thinking that a better indication might also be a rotation instead of left/right, which half of the time doesn't match up with what you'd expect on the screen."

You get all the usual histograms and statistics. This game has a particularly nice addition of a ""top percentile"" bracket, so you can compare yourself against the top 10% or top 1% if you enable it in settings for your best solutions. Somehow, it still lacks a little polish, but it has the regular quality of any Zachtronics game.For people that don't know Zachtronics:If you like statistics and puzzles, along with constantly trying to get a more efficient solution, you have struck a goldmine.

1168880,0,0,iwikal,69,4,1,88.4,"December 28, 2020","This game is hard core. Where Opus Magnum took major strides in user friendliness, clarity, convenience and overall polish, with this game, Zachtronics does a 180 and goes the opposite way. It is obtuse, alien, cryptic, retro, and completely devoid of tutorials. Figure it out as you go by trying every button or by applying previous knowledge of Zachtronics design idioms. As per usual, it allows you to create a non-optimal solution and move on to the next puzzle, but I feel like that approach misses the point of this type of game. When trying to optimise your solutions, the mechanics feel claustrophobic compared to the previous similar titles, and you quickly run out of instructions, space, or arms, creating truly brow-furrowing puzzles. That's what I love about this game. Also, the music (or ""ambience"" as the settings menu calls it) is great.Opus Magnum is still my overall favorite between the two, but this one is great in its own right."
1168880,10,0,76561198037059261,155,3,1,21.9,"December 27, 2020","MOLEK-SYNTEZ feels a lot like a sequel to Opus Magnum, albeit with one very significant change. You get to pick your own reagents. This makes your solutions feel a little more like your own. It makes you feel more connected to the in-game character, a clandestine chemist, who would presumably have at her disposal several reagents. This is something that was not present in Opus Magnum, where the Alchemist character would probably have access to more reagents than what each puzzle gave you. Admittedly, Opus Magnum always justified its restriction on reagents, and from a gameplay point of view this restriction might make for more interesting puzzles. But there is some merit to just giving the player a whole arsenal of reagents to choose which ones are best for the puzzle at hand. In a sense it expands the arms and glyphs system of Opus to the atoms as well. The main campaign is much shorter than Opus, and maybe because Opus was my first Zachtronics game, MOLEK-SYNTEZ felt much easier to solve, with optimization bringing about massive gains in each score metric. My first solutions on MOLEK-SYNTEZ were so atrociously inefficient that they just begged to be optimized, while that was not true in Opus. The story is very trimmed-down. It felt as a series of haikus told one verse at a time. It is so minimal I wouldn't even consider it a real part of the gameThe visuals are similarly simple, although I must say the mechanical sound from starting the game is insanely satisfying. It's a good game. If you haven't played Opus, play that instead. If you have only played Opus's main campaign, play the production alchemy and the diary puzzles from that game instead. If you find those more hasslesome than they're worth, play this game. I would give it a 6/10, because the game doesn't feel complex or deep enough to get away with such barebones presentation. It's a lot like Opus Magnum, but without all the aesthetic spectacle."

It's up to you to discover the game mechanics by testing things out. Bad solutions aren't too punishing since you can just hold right click and wipe away all the instructions, and the total amount of instructions to complete a puzzle are typically small compared to some of the other Zachtronics games. Because of this there's no scrolling; your whole solution is immediately viewable on the screen.Once you figure out the game mechanics, the puzzles are probably some of the easiest in aggregate out of all Zachtronics games, though I feel like they get a little bland around the center of each campaign since the chemicals I'm creating sort of blend into each other and there aren't many new concepts introduced in that time. It wasn't until later in each campaign that I felt like I needed to learn clever techniques and tricks to actually solve the puzzles.Generally the way the game was designed makes me feel like a scientist, since it's just me and the equipment, which I just love, and the overall mood of the game matches this pretty well. The story line was a bit too edgy though, and one point I couldn't stop laughing because it started to feel almost satirical.Optimization is really interesting in this game, the second puzzle actually has like 3 different solutions that get successively crazier and more complex to shave off those last few cycles. I have not tried optimizing all the puzzles, but it certainly has felt like a unique experience compared to the other games trying to see just how tightly all of my instructions can be squeezed together.Overall Molek-Syntez is a solid installment of the Zachtronics games, and it works especially well for the players that love to just sit back and explore what this chemistry machine is capable of."

The order of operations is of precedence, not  in numerical order of the emitters, and as there is no docs or tutorial, it is left to the player to find out by trial-and-error.  Outputting (the 'c' command) on a specific emitter does not output the molecule in the line of sight of said emitter, but the just-auto-imported base molecule (idk, this feels like it's a bug, but again, such things couldn't happen in spacechem since you control the input)."

It doesn't.After having not played the game for a few weeks, I feel zero desire to pick it up again.Presentation wise, the game resembles TIS-100: extremely minimalistic. It's just a grayscale UI for selecting puzzles, really. There is no story, or any sort of window dressing for that matter.One positive note: the drone-like ambient music is some of the best in any Zachtronics game.

You have a restricted instruction set from your modules on the outside of the playing area, with up to 6 modules able to give instructions. You also have a limited number of total instructions before it returns to the top of the instructions - this happens en masse so you can't have a module doing the same set of instructions faster (without putting the instruction set in multiple times), but also avoiding sync problems.There is a story of sort, but it's more of a mood piece than anything, with snippets of the chemist's private thoughts coming in after completing so many levels. Combined with the stark black and white aesthetic, the setting feels bleakly eastern European or Russian, about a chemist finding some level of power in restoring drugs to what seems to be some kind of post-apocalyptic world.Ultimately the story never really amounts to much, and is not continued into the bonus set of puzzles. Mechanics-wise some of the early levels are quite easy and a player would be well-advised to try and match the best cycles, modules and programming symbols used stats (noting that your best stat from each solution is used, so you can optimise however you like).As I progressed to the later levels I found myself content to just get to a solution however I could within the constraints of the programming environment.There is also as is traditional a solitaire game to play when puzzle solving gets too stressful, but I bounced off this one for whatever reason - it's functional but I personally preferred some of the other Zachtronics solitaire games.I very much enjoyed the puzzles but I would have appreciated some more story. An ability to revisit the story parts as text or similar would have been a nice feature too. The bleak mood is well conveyed by the elements of the game, including the subtle background sound evoking a life in a desolate tundra.

Puzzles start and end with real molecules - this may be realistic in a certain sense, but from the perspective of a puzzle game, the resulting inputs and outputs felt arbitrary, convoluted, and unnecessarily big.I also found some peculiarities of the set of available commands rather annoying: for instance, you will frequently have to use the same ""remove/add bond"" command 3-4 times consecutively, which feels aesthetically unsatisfying in a game genre based on optimization and automation. The way the game deals with clashing commands (e.g. when you simultaneously try to move a molecule and remove a bond) also felt very inelegant to me, as did the inability to rotate the particle beam emitters.One criterion by which I judge this genre is whether I feel motivated to return and optimize earlier levels, and that didn't happen here at all.Ultimately, Zachtronics have made enough great games that I personally don't see a reason to play or recommend this one."

If you are a Zach fan, you'll get it anyway.  If you're not, this one doesn't quite have the magic to pull you in.  There's no real explanations, not even a PDF like with some of the others, and I find myself floundering a little. So yeah, what everyone else said- lo-fi reboot of Opus Magnum.  Instead of placing arms in the field you're acting on the field from the perimeter only.  And instead of simply saying ""bond"" or ""de-bond"", you have to finagle chemical reactions by throwing hydrogen around.  Unfortunately it has the particular quality that Opus Magnum has that makes it less satisfying to me.  While in SpaceChem or Exapunks, every solution feels like a triumph, in Opus Magnum and this one, you can kind of brute force any ugly solution and move on.  Sometimes I'm embarrassed and I'll go back to improve them, but sometimes, I just leave a mangled Frankenstein and advance.I know it doesn't sound like I'm recommending it.

What else to say.I have no idea how accurate it is to actual chemistry, but it sure is fun!Edit: Ok, on a more objective tone. The game has no manual and much less writing than their other works, and is more of ""just a puzzle"" than say TIS-100 or Shenzhen I/O, whether for good or not.Some mechanics are pretty smoky and hard to understand, and there's no proper tutorial besides the first molecule(s). The order in which commands are executed, the scoring systems and some of the rules of bonds aren't explained, and you gotta go trial and error to find out whether your solution works.The puzzles themselves are very polished, but lacks some useful tools: being able to select rows, columns and pieces of commands to cut, copy and paste would be a very welcome improvement. Also ""keep editing a copy"" as a choice after completing the molecule would be very nice.The solitaire!

With that said, this feels like their first genuine misfire.The unique appeal of Zachtronics' games lies in their paradoxical ability to provide endless freedom within a set of severe constraints. Their challenge is derived from very limited instruction sets and, in some cases, very limited space, but there are an endless number of ways in which their puzzles can be approached to provide multiple valid solutions. In MOLEK-SYNTEZ I only feel constraints. It does not provide a sandbox of moving parts I can get amongst and reposition and reprogram; it provides a sandbox I can only interact with from the edges via six immobile magnets which can push, pull, rotate and add or remove hydrogen atoms. That's it. Using this instruction set you need to transform chemicals into other chemicals. The goal is the same as Spacechem, but the toolkit you're provided to achieve it is nowhere near as fun to work with.The process of puzzle solving generally involves spamming add commands to unbond atoms, moving one chemical closer to another, then spamming remove commands to rebond atoms. It's a very simplistic process with little room for variation in approach. During planning you can move chemicals and reposition magnets around the sandbox border, but the challenge comes from the fact that once your solution starts running there is no command to move the magnets, nor directly pick up the chemicals. As the chemicals are moved, the atom around which the chemical pivots changes in accordance with the atoms' direct line of sight to the various magnets, meaning that all six magnets must be used to effectively manipulate the chemicals in such a way that they don't collide with other chemicals in a very small space. If there is a core mental concept the game could be said to test, it would be spatial reasoning.Not helping the limited gameplay is the presentation feeling rushed and barebones. It contains none of the studio's usually excellent music, the trademark 'twist' on the solitaire game is the fact that you can cheat once by moving a card to an illegal location, and the art style is basically nonexistent. The game loads quickly and its UI is user friendly, so it is well made from a technical perspective, but the studio's usual high level of artistic polish is absent.I have a feeling that after Eliza (Zachtronics' previous game and first visual novel) failed to achieve much resonance with fans, nor draw in newcomers, Zach wanted to push out a puzzle game to show he had not lost touch with his fans or their interests. It feels like a product made to send a message and draw in a few quick dollars rather than a creation born from passion.I am proud to say that I have completed every Zachtronics game, aside from TIS-100 and SHENZHEN I/O, which I put down because I was not mentally geared towards the code they required.

1168880,0,0,stfmnsl,195,9,1,22.1,"December 1, 2019","Typical Zachtronics. If you love them all (as I do) you will this one as well. If you hate the other games, or don't get it, well, don't bother."
1168880,1,0,mrbayhu,281,13,1,4.9,"November 30, 2019","The gameplay is very similar to Opus Magnum, except for having basically no story and maybe less pleasing visuals. Still, a really good Zachtronics puzzle game!"
1168880,1,0,Manbearpigbear,563,6,1,2.9,"November 30, 2019","If you've played zachatronics other games you'll already know if you'll like this one or not.if you haven't its a great puzzle game that starts out with straightforward challenges that quickly show you that you need to learn and create new techniques for each level and that you can't just be content to use old tricks. it includes graphs after each one to show you how your solution compares to other ones, with extra details for your friends. a lot of the fun isn't it just solving the levels but optimizing them in multiple ways.as far as story you can actually miss it very easily but what is there is interesting and clearly thought out rather than just an after thought."

1168880,8,0,76561198035605935,197,4,1,43.2,"November 30, 2019","Really enjoyed it. For people who have played other Zachtronics games, this one feels a bit like a hybrid of SpaceChem and Opus Magnum - probably more similar to the latter. It has less art, audio, and story with it though - this one is pretty much purely gameplay. Main 'quest' difficulty quite low for the most part, most of the fun comes in trying to get lower cycle or module scores. Mini-game is a twist on solitaire.For people who haven't played Zachtronics games, this is a fairly accessible one, and some of the best systems optimisation puzzling around. You don't need to know anything about chemistry to play it."
1168880,0,0,servoiiv,130,5,1,1.9,"November 30, 2019","Up front admission. I love Zachtronics games. If you like open ended puzzles with a multitude of solutions check this out. I love that you can solve the puzzles your way, but you can go back and optimize in order to get a better solution. The great thing is you don't have to. As long as it works you can move on. Any time I see a new game by this developer I buy it, because everything that they've released has been really interesting and challenging."
1168880,0,0,rhinodude_,408,11,1,7.9,"November 29, 2019",Not as polished as Opus Magnum and the colour scheme is quite bland but it's still a very addictive fun Zachtronics game.
1168880,0,0,wegotdafunk,70,4,1,117.9,"November 29, 2019","Like all zachronics puzzle games, this provides puzzles with a wide breadth of solutions available to the player, and allows the player to optimize for 3 different measurements.  Your solution may be optimal for components or instructions, or cycles, rarely can you find one that's good for 2 and never for all 3.  The histograms after you finish a puzzle can show you when you've done a solution that's better or worse then the other players who have attempted it.  The puzzles themselves are so esoteric that these games are highly re-playable.  If you don't like complicated puzzle games this will not be for you.  The story is thin, but mildly interesting, but there is great joy in learning the capacities and limitations of the playing field.  Which precursor molecules should I pick for this chemical?  Can I repeat this similar structure twice to save in both components and cycles? If you like the min/max questions and to see tiny machines doing your bidding, this is a good game for you."
