0,2704,"If you are at all interested in Computer Science or just logic gates (redstone masters in Minecraft), this game is great for stretching out that brain muscle. The fact there are so many kinds of solutions you can make while learning different parts of a computer is so fun."
1,2704,computer go beep boop
2,2704,"Huge potential, but definitely an early access title.I recommend this depending on what you want to get out of the game, but with a HUGE caveat that it doesn't do anything to teach you new concepts beyond giving you a puzzle to play with and test your guesses. As such, I would recommend this as a supplement to a course like the famous ""NAND 2 Tetris"" course or the accompanying ""Elements of Computing Systems"" book to learn the theory then apply/test it in Turing Complete.Another big caveat is that in addition to not explaining the computing concepts, the interface to the game isn't explained very well either. This lead me to about 15 minutes of blindly clicking random UI elements to figure out what the game wanted of me. If you're used to looking at truth tables, you'll probably have an easier time figuring it out, but the interface is still very awkward, with the signal emitter toggles in the far left of the screen and the truth tables on the bottom (and some of the tables are interactive, and some aren't, and it's not telegraphed well at all) and the components in the far right. I also had some dialogue boxes overlay on top of each other, making them impossible to read. I think this is exacerbated since I'm playing on a linux computer with a hidpi display, which makes everything super tiny and probably out of place.One last thing is that as far as I can tell, when you move a component, you can't move any of the signal routing ""wires"" with it, so you have to delete the wires and re-connect them if you need to move components to organize your circuit better. I'm sure that if there's not already a way to preserve connections, there will be one soon enough.Overall, I recommend it to people who are aware of the issues with the current early access build and still want to play it or support the project, otherwise I'd say wait until it's a bit more polished. Regardless, I think it has a ton of potential and am really excited to see this game evolve."
3,2704,"A game made with Godot and written with Nim, I am super impressed!"
4,2704,fun
5,2704,Easy steps lead to building a fully functional computer
6,2704,A really cool way to learn low -level stuff
7,2704,"Already I can see this evolving into a great puzzle game, kind of a cross between shapes.io and Infinifactory  (both of which I also recommend). There are definitely occasional crashing issues, and I see very strange behavior switching focus from one monitor to the other (but this may be the fault of the game library, Godot). I have not made it to the end of the game yet, but I already feel drawn to it, and that is praise enough for me to give this game a thumbs up."
8,2704,this game crashes randomly A LOT. Very disappointed.
9,2704,"There is a saying, which I think perfectly describes this game, that goes : ""if you cannot explain something in simple terms, you don't understand it"". Puzzles are ordered in a (mostly) logical order which will allow you to learn how to build ever increasingly complex components from previous learnings, without ever feeling overwhelmed. Whether you are a programmer/computer engineer just brushing up on known concepts, or starting from scratch with an interest for logic or computing, this game will syphon more time than you can imagine.I was worried the game was going to be too railroaded or just plain tedious but here I am spending an extra half hour / hour (s) after completing a puzzle just to get is a compact, elegant and efficient as possible.At the time of writing this review, the game has a few issues and crashes rather frequently when trying to move/delete things but thankfully any change is auto-saved so I never found myself losing any progress. Moreover the developer seems committed to fixing and improving his passion project & updates are very frequent from what I have seen.Moreover, if you have no prior knowledge of logic or binary, I suggest you look up on some material to get you going : boolean algebra, Karnaugh tables and binary. The game has clear instructions on what to do to solve a given puzzle but it won't teach you how.---If you are into computer hardware and/or software, or just like challenging puzzles that teach you something, you won't regret getting into Turing Complete!"
10,2704, dark souls
11,2704,"Still has some rough edges, but very entertaining and learning experience has been great. Game probably doesn't give you the best direction at times (not just with learning how to create a computer from scratch, but also about the UI).255/255 Would definitely build another computer architecture."
12,2704,"The game seems interesting but is crashing way too much. If you click the screen say 3 times fast, expect it to crash. Still going to give it a go but seems quite unstable in the current condition. Will update review depending how far I get. Thumbs up for now."
13,2704,"An incredible game that teaches logic circuits in a fun way. If you've ever wondered how that magic box you're using to read this review actually works, this game is for you.Some levels might be hard without previous knowledge of the subject, or they may be too easy with too much such knowledge, but every step is part of the bigger picture and well worth your time. While the store page claims programming isn't taught, there are some challenges that test your algorithmic thinking in an assembly language you created yourself. The sandbox mode is sure to spawn lots of awesome community creations.  And new content is still being added!  The dev is incredibly responsive btw, so if you have an idea for a feature, getting this in Early Access will absolutely be worth it."
14,2704,I didn't expect the amount of content to be this deep. Other similar attempts at this concept end way to soon. This game gave me all the tools i need to get satisfied at designing a computer.
15,2704,"The gameplay gives a good feeling for the buildup in complexity from simple logic gates to more complicated things like a one-bit adder on up to a full computer. For someone with experience in digital logic design, the puzzles, especially the early ones, will not be particularly challenging, but the problems build on each other and are fund to solve. Even the early, relatively easy problems have their charm."
16,2704,"I bought this game just to support and reward the author and encourage similar games to be made. I don't think of it as a game but more as interactive educational experience. This is basically a crash course on microcontrollers, from logical gates all the way to machine codes and simple assembly language, the type I went through 20  years ago working on my CS degree (actually, these were at least 3 different courses). I also intend to use this to go through the concepts with my 14yo son."
17,2704,Really good the game actually teaches you a lot about how computers and their components work and interact. Just exactly what I want in the world.
18,2703,Needs better hints a tutorials to allow for better information
19,2703,"If you like puzzles and trying to solve a puzzle for hours, this is one of the best games you can play. If you also interested in computer science in becomes more fun. 10/10"
20,2703,"Don't study computer science, just play this game instead"
21,2703,"Taught me more than any professor ever has, 10/10."
22,2703,instructions unclear
23,2703,This game makes my brain hurt. 10/10
24,2703,"A great game that allows you to build a simple, yet powerful CPU. For sure, it's not even close to other games in terms of graphics, storytelling, or whatever, yet its core part, about building logic blocks is smooth and contains a lot of quality-of-life features, that you can expect from such game.A few important notes:1. I believe there is not enough information in the game, to solve all puzzles, without previous knowledge about computer logic, how CPU works, and so on. It's kind of OK because it still allows you to experiment and find things by yourself, either by ""trial and error"" or by searching stuff on the internet (e.g.: googling for ""how CPU works"" on youtube can provide really good results)2. At the start of the game, it looks really simple both in terms of gameplay and in terms of features. Don't let this fool you, a lot of features will come up later: some of the missions will unlock new things like the ability to color different wires or even ""component factory"" when you can build some parts that can be reused as components.The game itself can be frustrating, or due to unfair difficulty, when the game will not explain some key things and will ask you to come up with a solution by yourself, or when it will ask you to make something that will require placing the same components over and over again connecting them to each other even when you already know the solution, or solution is simple yet you should do it manually first (e.g. when you need to unlock things for bytes, the game requires that you first will split byte to 8 bits, and then do the same thing with those bits, and then connect them to byte again, which is not interesting, not challenging, but just 8 same components each one with 3 wires, all of which should be connected manually).Additionally, when you can't find a solution for some challenge sometimes you can proceed further, you are locked behind the task, that you had no information about from the game, in-game hints are not helpful and you need to look at the same scheme over and over again till you will come up with a solution that will work.Those points can ruin your experience with the game, and make it harder to recommend this to a friend.Yet I still recommend it if you are interested in computers or CPUs. Just don't be afraid to find the information on the net. This game is not really about ""solving the tasks just to solve the tasks"", it's more like step by step introduction to how the computer works at the fundamental level.The game itself feels like ""SHENZHEN I/O"" but on a lower level: instead of writing programs on already existing components, you must first engineer your own."
25,2703,This game is great if you have some background in electronics and logic circuits. Really fun and challenging with a lot of hands on education. Some of the levels are a bit difficult and I had to find some external material to help me through but for the most part this game is great at taking you from the baby basics to fairly complex concepts in a way that is easy to understand.
26,2703,"Wow. It basically is a 3 to 6 credits computer science course (Logics and CPU stuff). Love this, can't recommend more!"
27,2703,
28,2703,Oh my.. what a gem of a game!Only spent a short time on it so far but really enjoying the challenge.I'm an industrial automation engineer and program PLC's (Programmable logic controllers) and using this shows how lazy i have become over the years by using pre-built functions or just dropping into script.Well worth the investment :)
29,2703,"thought hard, make computer to thought for me, good."
30,2703,"If you can interpret CS as ""computer science"", I recommend this game.For other people (who are not familiar with computer science), I don't recommend this game at this moment, because tutorial part is not enough.  If you've learned CS but could not imagine how it is implemented, this game helps to understand how it is built and what is the important part in designing architecture including assembly lang.One warning is that current UI is painful in debugging and developing complicated logic.  I want developer to improve QoL along with tutorial for beginners.QoL: accidentally drawing a line when moving parts.  shortcut access to parts.  always visible instruction and goal. unmaintainable instruction doc and asm lang.  undefined behavior in question texts. hardness to debug value contamination or flow.Tutorial: what is recursive? idea of call stack, more guidance for calculate and switch idea.The difficulty is ok for a software engineer (=me) to finish all stages in 12 hours.  If assembly editor supports rich features (like index accessing `array[x+idx]`) and if there is a score histogram for NAND score / delay, I may try more complicated algorithmic problems or optimization."
31,2703,"This game will be hard. If you don't know programming, I recommend at least learning about k-maps, what logic gates are, and mayyyyybe very simple programming logic (the 30 minute tutorials are probably good enough).  For reference, I've completed a computer science degree and work full time as a developer. Admittedly gates are not my forte, but the logical thinking applies here too. While the game does teach your all the basics you'd really know, I'd wager it'd be incredibly difficult to use only what the game has taught you for the further levels.  That said, I think the game is the perfect difficulty for anyone who studies software engineering or computer science; hardware engineers will probably feel like it's too similar to what they do for work. The whole timing thing is simplified (there's no phases, it's just 1 tick), so I guess this could be a good destresser for hardware engineers.  Wording was also sometimes confusing, although I must admit that I don't have a better way of doing so. Something for the dev to figure out.Last 2 things - this game crashes quite a bit, but not so often that it's annoying. It's early access though, and based on the dev's track record, I'd expect this to be ironed out before release.  I'd also like to see a creative mode of sorts. The way the game is set up makes non-8bit/byte architecture incredibly difficult to make. While this simplification / restriction was obviously in place to make the experience a bit easier for those who are not  engineers / programmers, it really feels like the potential of what this can be is stifled. Of course, I'm not going to use this as a full on hardware emulator and test out designs or assembly code, but it's still neat to be able to do these things and I think a lot of us will have a lot of fun doing so. Either way - I definitely think this is a really fun game if you've enjoyed the dev's preivous offerings, or stuff like shenzhen IO and TIS-1000. This is definitely quite a bit harder, but I'm sure you'll be able to figure it out eventually."
32,2703,Hope you can focus more on teaching. The reason I can pass the level is that I have already known the answer rather than it did teach me something.
33,2703,Completely demystifies the way computers work. Fun and educational!
34,2703,"Makes it easy to understand how CPUs work. I just draw the schematics for a 8-bit RAM, it was surprisingly fun and not too hard."
35,2703,"It has been right about a decade since I have done any digital logic design. This game is tough but fairly straightforward if you have a background in any amount of digital logic, even if it is has been years. It is remarkably helpful to have some background though, I am not sure I would have progressed without a having some experience with truth tables, demorgan's, gate truth tables, etc. My biggest concern is I know I have made unoptimized solutions just to progress and if this was something I was truly learning it might be bad practice. The developer mentioned that there was ""scoring"" before but it was removed because players tend to not progress. I suspect the ability to view an optimized version or even to ramp difficultly by pointing these things out in the ""end game"" and letting me go back would do a lot towards negating this.This is a fun game and the controls are great. The topics covered are difficult, expect to do a fair bit of reading and learning if you have not done anything with digital logic, binary, instruction sets, etc."
36,2703,"If you like puzzles, this one might just teach you something about how computers work. Love it !"
37,2703,this game got me to study Karnaugh maps and boolean algebra
38,2703,I built the computer.
39,2703,Great review (or introduction to) the basics of digital logic all the way up to a basic computer.
40,2703,If you're even remotely interested in learning how a computer works you should get this game. Very rewarding experience. Don't give up.
41,2703,"Currently trying CS50 online, and idk... It all just feels right (the things are ""...all coming together""). For what Turing Complete offers to teach (or just share), the interface, the progression, the sound design, and even the narrative work so well together to present a challenging and rewarding puzzle journey.This is my first NAND gate to Assembly Programming experience, and I am well pleased.Also, if it were not for the Developer's timeous forum feedback and frequent updates I would not even notice that the game was still in development."
42,2703,Good. I wish there is a sandbox mode.
43,2703,"Already one of the better problem solving games on steam, I'm excited to see where this goes!"
44,2703,"Pretty cool game, gives a decent idea of how a CPU works although the CPU you make is definitely a ""toy"" CPU in that it is probably circa 1975 technology.  However, it does allow you to understand the basics of how a CPU is supposed to work, what it does, how it processes instructions, and the like.  I do think some of the text explaining what you need to do could be made clearer.  The ""storyline"" is also very much ""fluff"" -- I think the game would be fine if it just asked you to build a CPU and didn't give you some silly ""aliens"" based reason to do it.  There were some reviews saying that some of the higher levels don't explain what to do but I disagree, I was able to build the full CPU within a day, fewer than 8 hours played and many of those hours I was away from the computer.  Google is a very good resource as all of the concepts in the logic gates/build a CPU phase are well known circuit design concepts."
45,2703,it is a fun unique game but i would love more hints and better explanations for certain goals
46,2703,"10/10, will write more later"
47,2703,"I recommend this game, and after playing it and getting about half way up the 'puzzles' I can use an FPGA that I bought some time ago :)It would be really helpful if the developer added a way to toggle the new wire button on and off for those of us who can not get the ALT to create wire to work easily.It is more difficult to pan now that the button has been removed, but if you uncheck the top box in the options menu, you will be able to play the game again."
48,2702,"After playing for 4 hours, @Whoat's review is spot on. ""The problem with this game is that it doesn't teach you. It just shows you puzzles and wants you to figure them out. That is fine when you are designing simple gates, but when you are supposed to design multiplexer you still rely on the same 'just try something'.""I got through the first couple of parts, but feel that I needed to already know what things do and be able to apply it practically... when in reality I was hoping to pick up something from it. Got railroaded by the memory section. It's an early access game with great potential, so I suppose there's time to try and address the learning curve/instruction/teaching/etc. but couldn't recommend it as it is."
49,2702,"Great game, best game I ever played. Run's without problem on my Mac."
50,2702,"Great concept and, for me, the perfect way to learn about the building blocks of computers! Keep up the good work!"
51,2702,"This is it. This is the puzzle ""game"" I've been dreaming of."
52,2702,Electrical engineering course in a box. Love it.
53,2702,"The game is fun for someone who already got in touch with computer science. I enjoyed it, its satisfying to see that the lectures in university didn't just flow by, also I generally like games like Human Resource Machinem 7 Billion Humans etc.I also liked the saving/progressing, didn't have to waste any time on figuring out where I can save the current wiring so I can continue next time etc.BUT it doesn't really teach you, it feels like you're thrown into the levels like a Pokemon, which additionaly starts the battle confused.It can be improved by recognizing common mistakes and dropping hints for the player (took me quite a while to realize my label is at a line > 63, thus all tries to jump there create bugs (in my code))I noticed at one point, that a component in the later game bugs after a long play session. Can't remember exact details, but closing the level and reopening it fixed it.A price of 10 fits better.TLDR: good Early Access title, but rather for nerds than normal consumers."
54,2702,"Puzzle game/logic simulator that takes you through building a simple-ish 8-bit computer from logic gates.  Playable as-is with a typical amount of Early Access bugs and headaches.  Definitely not a casual puzzle game, but not too punishing if you've had some exposure to the basics of logic and computers.  If this is all new you... expect to spend time reading outside of the game; this will not be easier than an intro course on the same - It's rewarding when it clicks, but this is only slightly dumbed down and scaled down from the real thing.Also contains a sandbox to play with custom architectures (or re-implement classic 8- and 16-bit chips); looks very promising, though going to need more features before we can really go wild."
55,2702,Pain.
56,2702,"This game is way more fun than I was expecting. I've played similar games before and this is by far the best.Normally you build a small part of an ALU, here you build an actual computer."
57,2702,"I have a degree in Electrical Engineering and I focus on this stuff; that is the only reason I have been able to solve many of the levels in this game. Of course many of the answers can be found on Google or in the right textbook, but come on...this game really ought to endeavor to TEACH you the valuable concepts you need like Discrete Algebra or K-maps that you would use to actually build efficient circuits. Some levels even refuse answers which are functionally equivalent but use more gates than others, so why the **** would you not then teach someone how to use a K-map? Love the concept and the flow of the game, but it could REALLY use some technical context. Would recommend to engineers, others should go dip their nose in a digital logic text first..."
58,2702,"Just finished the current content and totally loved it. Basically hardcored it for a week, took about 75 hours to do which included a full redesign of my CPU. Learnt a lot, especially planning for expandability and not just throwing in random gates to make something work. Maybe 16bit is next? Would love to be guided through some of the next building blocks in the stack maybe creating floating point math, building a compiled language.The one downside is playing on laptop and cranking through battery. Would love to see line/command aliases in assembly to avoid having to modify them when I add lines"
59,2702,exactly what I have been looking for other than it could be a little more clear on what you should do by giving examples or just explaining what it wants better. other than that its great
60,2702,This game's unique idea is wonderful and it has a lot of learn effect for any level and any age.i am really positively impressed and hope to see more levels coming
61,2702,"This is no bs electronic look-alike puzzle game: This is a rather complete crash course in computer science history.Explanations can feel a bit lacking sometimes and occasionally you are left wondering what the best solution would have been, but if you are an electronic engineer wannabe, a programmer wondering whats under the hood or simply an obsessive-compulsive masochist looking for a challenge, you should DEFINITELY give this game a try.There is lots of content, even for a beta, and although the UI can be a bit wonky sometimes the dev team keeps pushing updates daily, so I have high hopes for when I revisit this game in a couple months."
62,2702,No time to write a longer review. Have to play the game!
63,2702,"There is little more satisfying than solving a problem with an algorithm you designed on your own CPU in your own assembly language. The game is friendly and guides you from NAND gate to CPU, with a wonderfully dry humour (that does seem to disappear by the end game unfortunately). The dev is also super active, with bug fixes and tweaks coming out seemingly daily, although these have broken the game for an hour or so at least once. It may not have the competitive score chasing of the seminal zachtronics games, but this game feels much more cohesive and focused with levels being linked and building upon each other, and the pay-off at the end is greater than a single puzzle level could be on it's own. Plus, there's nothing stopping you creating your own CPU architecture from scratch and solving puzzles with that. If you're weird."
64,2702,"I really love this game. It really does take you through the journey of building a computer from the ground up which is something I have been wanting for years. I never thought I would actually understand how to make an ALU or how a computer actually works. This is the future of education, I really hope this type of concept is done for more topics it would be amazing."
65,2702,A great game where you build a turing-complete computer from ground up. Without knowing anything about logic and assembly you will have a difficult time but it should be doable. But even if you have some experience in those topics it's still challenging. Finally I can use all that theoretical knowledge from university!
66,2702,"Comprehensive game that teaches you the most fundamental principles behind circuits and computing. A must have for any aspiring Electrical, Computer, or Software Engineer. Despite it being in early access it is still very well made, and the developer seems dedicated to supporting the project for many years to come. It is also quite accessible to younger audiences because of its simplistic UI."
67,2702,"I love how far the game takes the concept, from the absolute basics through building a working computer and a low level assembly language.There is some polishing to be done, probably some optional hints or guides for those who are new to the concepts, but that's expected with an early access.Definitively recommended."
68,2702,gamer
69,2702,"I'd given up on understanding digital circuits, but I'm absolutely loving Turing Complete.  I find it hard to believe I've already put in 4 hours.  I had really only understood each logic gate on its own before starting, and now I'm obsessively building and optimizing circuits!  Thank you!"
70,2702,"A phenomenal ""programming"" game, that teaches you how to go from simple NAND gates, all they way up to a fully functioning computer. It's interesting, challenging, and has a great sense of humour. Strongly recommend this for anyone who is curious about how computers work."
71,2702,I dream in binary now
72,2702,"1. Start a level2. Read instructions3. Ignore instructions as you are a fool4. Throw some random gates in there5. Wire that sh*t up6. Wrong7. Reread instructions8. Force monkey brain to comprehend9. Throw more gates in there10. Probably way over complicate it11. ""It just works""12. Repeat until later levels13. It no longer works that way in later levels14.

73,2702,"This is an incredibly awesome game (if you like puzzles)! I like how you can experiment with the circuit's inputs and see how it reacts. The visualization of the state of the wire also greatly helps. As an added bonus, the humor of the alien overlord is very amusing :)"
74,2702,"I really like the concept of the game. And you already learn a lot. It is, by all means, not easy. But completing a level on your own way feels rewarding. I also can see appliances for educational purposes, but there it has to compete with nandgame, witch is a lot more accessible. Id recommend trying nandgame first, to see if its your kind of game,  and if you enjoyed that, its game is definitively something for you"
75,2702,An excellent puzzle puzzle/logic/programming game. Turing Complete does a great job of letting you build a basic computer processor step by step using simple logic gates.
76,2702,needs more hand holding. until then go on youtube and watch some videos on building an 8 bit computer that should help you get an idea of what to do in this game
77,2702,"Good game to freshen up on some digital design, and computer arch. I wouldn't enter this game as a newbie or as a starting point if you are interested in CS there is some background knowledge needed to make it far into the game."
78,2702,"Great Game! Yeah, it crashed a couple of times, it has a few bugs and the framerate on the later levels weren't perfect but I definitely got my moneys worth. But if you've ever wanted to know how 8-bit cpus work this is the game for you. I mean you literally get to make your very own (With some help) starting from a simple nand gate!"
79,2702,"After reading a couple of the negative reviews for this game I was on the fence, but decided to buy the game. I honestly haven't been able to put it down, it is excellent.Yes, some quality of life improvements are needed, but the game is still very enjoyable. You start by building components at a very low level with logic gates, and work up the layers of abstraction to produce a machine which you are then able to program to solve puzzles. It is incredibly satisfying.Wholeheartedly recommend."
80,2702,"The main problem with this game is that it doesnt teach you anything, you do fine at the start but when you go into more complex problems its nearly impossible without looking it up or cheating."
81,2702,"Playing on Ubuntu 18.04 and works perfectly.This is a lot of fun. It's definitely a great pick both for students of programming and electronics, and even for those more experienced in the field. I have not completed it yet, but I have had a lot of fun thinking up new ways to construct logic circuitry, even revising the way I would normally do things.As well, I think anyone who loves Minecraft redstone would have a lot of fun (and learn a lot) with this in it's step-by-step approach to computing challenges and logic. It's definitely going to get some playtime by my kids who love Minecraft!"
82,2702,cool
83,2702,Great puzzle game especially for programmers and computer engineers like me who like to brush up their understanding about logic gates and how computers work inside. Good game also for those who are interested in this kind of logic puzzle games in general.
84,2702,"Purely by coincidence I was playing in logisim thinking about making a computer from fundamental logic as a nerdy exercise / time waster. Turns out that in Turing Complete, I can do that while also farming Steam 'cheeves. What's not to love?"
85,2702,"I'm 3 hours in so far and quite enjoying it. I have played several games of this sort. I have no real electrical or programming background, I just enjoy them.Of particular note is that finally, someone is smart enough to essentially make a game for NAND to Tetris. Though I will admit, I enjoy mazes more than Tetris and that is the determining factor for why I gave this game a shot. Either way, the game is honestly quite good as well. Definitely one of the better sort of programming games of its kind and not just because it covers a larger from-logic-gates-to-programming than any other game I've seen. The humour is spot on (I definitely don't want to be eaten) and I am enjoying the GUI and UX.All I want is to learn how to build circuits in Factorio so I can program logistic networks, and this game seems like it might get me there."
86,2702,love this game its a good way to lurn about the logic gates and bytes goot puzzles too
87,2702,Great logic game - NOT for the faint of heart... :)
88,2702,"You want to learn and understand how computers work on the most basic level? Don't waste your time trying to read through miles long wikipedia articles about semiconductors, RAMs and ALUs, just start this game, get addicted and you will (almost) be able to build your very own (almost) fully funcioning computer in (almost) no time. [Disclaimer: This game is still a good bit different than real life and playing this game won't make you a professional computer builder. The author will not take any responsibility for failed computer designer careers and/or burnt body parts caused by incidents while trying to build an own computer(-parts). Please do not contact the author for any further information or regarding issues caused by this review.]"
89,2702,"One of the best games I have played in recent memory, I think some knowledge of truth tables and logic circuits in general is needed to be able to enjoy this game, but building an 8bit Turing machine from the ground up is incredibly satisfying.In my opinion this game exceeds Zachtronics games like SHENZHEN I/O, even though it is less polished, because the puzzles are truly based on one another and you have a better and very satisfying sense of progress."
90,2701,"It pains me to say, this is one on which to wait for now as it needs a lot of work...It's a shame as there is nothing quite like it. The controls are very clunky but the concept remains extremely compelling and no matter at what level you find yourself on the computer architecture knowledge scale, you'll likely learn something or at least recognize an environment where you can try new architectures with little effort.That said, it's also one of the worst user experience I've ever had with any software. Stability is non existent at this point with frequent ungraceful crashes straight to OS (I'm writing this after having crashed the thing twice in a minute just by trying to rename a schematic...). I'm very much used to banana software: ship it green and let it ripe in the user's hands, but this is one very green one and will need a lot of time to mature properly (and no, the Early Access label is no emergency exit here: get early feedback on features to make the whole better, sure. But crowd sourcing fundamental debugging to the users is not and has never been the intent of EA). I don't regret getting it, hopefully the dev will get things in order at some point. But I've had to put it aside until some sort of stability is achieved since progression is pretty much impossible right now."
91,2701,"I just completed making a calculator in one of the middle levels and I realised that I was only half way through the game. I don't think the solutions I have been coming up with are exactly efficient, but I love the freedom to experiment. I appreciate the effort that went into making this"
92,2701,"The game is just broken for me. When I add in custom modules, the game crashes. They're saved though, so I can restart the game and continue. But then random modules will rarely RANDOMLY MOVE ON LOAD, AAAA- *cough* - which creates a slew of odd bugs. I'm at the level ""turing complete"" and in my conditional, I'd taken negative values into consideration. Because, you know, There's a ""less than 0"" sign. Maybe I'm misunderstanding something and I'm raging too soon, but it seems as though the game wanted it to be implemented without negative numbers for some wild reason.So I remove the conditional signal for less than. It should now act as 'never'. Problem solved, I thought.Then I get the vaguest error imaginable. ""the counter should be 7 next tick, it will be 6"". HOW DO I DEBUG THIS? HOW?! The counter is a tiny thing sitting on its own in the top left. There's no way the bug is there. So it's ""Somewhere else"". I just can't debug it if I tried. I guess it has something to do with the removed feature in the conditional, but... I've no idea why or how or what on earth is going on.Add in how clunky the UI is, how hard it is to move things around, how difficult it is to see what is happening and this game is just frustration upon frustration. I want to solve these puzzles. I don't want to actively fight the game to make it happen.It is early access, of course, so maybe it'll improve. I really hope it improves."
93,2701,"Fantastic. I've hopes for a game like this for a long time. Although rough around the edges(it's EA), it's the best ""learn how a computer works while you build it"". Learning and having fun at the same time! Can't wait to see how the game evolves through EA."
94,2701,I cant stop. They have me held captive..... Send Help.  Or cookies.
95,2701,im so scared. Help me. I love it
96,2701,It's blast. Build a computer from scratch!
97,2701,Very fun game where you buld and program a computer from scratch.
98,2701,An entire university level course chucked into a fun game.
99,2701,"Really nice game!I like the experimenting approach. Not everything is served on a silver platter.On the other hand if would be good to have the ""correct"" solution after a finished level.One thing I miss is a separate clock signal so far (didn't complete the game yet, so this still might come?) or in general just mention at some point that there are synchronous and asynchronous ways of designing a circuit. But in the end it's a game and not a simulation software :)"
100,2701,"[Addressing other reviews]Some people not recommending this based on it not being perfectly purely educational. It's a game not a VHDL tool or professional circuit simulation software. The game happens to be founded in reality and there is a lot to be learned from it, but it's not meant to be a tool for educators or professionals, even though it might be useful for educators paired with classes or other material.[My feedback]I'm a sucker for this type of stuff. I do have a Computer Science background, so I had an edge on the binary logic and arithmetic which as other reviewers have stated are essentially pre-requisites. But the things you need to learn to not get blocked truly aren't that difficult to learn and there's tons of resources and materials online for that. That being said I address this and other shortcomings in  the feedback to devs section.The pacing and difficulty increase from stage to stage is pretty good and linear. I've had a blast playing it and if you are into this type of stuff you likely will as well. I'd say it's well worth the price tag in it's current state. And if they incorporate some of the feedback in other reviews then it can only get better value wise.[Feedback for devs]1. Level descriptions/objectives often leave a lot to be desired. There's a lot of having to figure out details once you're in the level and you can't easily build a good mental model of what the goal is just from the text.This is sometimes due to not enough specifics in the question. Or sometimes more nuanced. For example when you switch from the first computer model and start building the one that can process 4 bytes at a time. The first level just says take an input and add it and output it. But it doesn't tell you, oh by the way this is the start of a new computer you're making so take your time wiring things up in a way that make sense. Then the old model used modes in the opcode to determine behavior. One thing that took a little mental processing was(I'm not sure if this is how real hardware does it) but it does away with copy and instead any copy operation is just an add where you add 0 and it sends it off to the destination. This is clever and nice but there was no indication of any sort that it was going to be used as that as well. This was easy enough to reason about afterwards but would have been nice to have had it called out.Other little touches could go a long way, like having inputs and outputs labeled on the actual circuit so you can quickly tell what they are without having to look at the side and then flip states to see which one is affected on the board.2. The wire labeling is nice but I'd love to be able to drag out a box or something and label that box to indicate the function of certain areas of the circuit. Would also be nice to be able to label at least the registers on the board so you can quickly see r0 r1 r2 etc...3. Still not sure how to reset the ""games"" when I've gotten to a failed state using keyboard controls. I've had to exit the level and re enter to return it to it's original state.4. I don't know if it's something I'm doing or not, but using the tools feels a bit clumsy. I feel sometimes like I'll click the wire tool and even the cursor changes then when I go to use it instead of drawing a new wire it will drag around the node I clicked on to start the wire.It would be really nice to be able to switch colors without switching out of wire drawing mode.I seem to only be able to clear selections by clicking on the gray ""drawer"" at the bottom. It would be nice to be able to clear a selection by clicking anywhere that isn't the thing selected. It would be nice to have the components all visible on level start instead of them being collapsed. The first thing I'd do is open them all up, granted I am playing on an ultra-wide so that might be less favorable for smaller monitors.This is an awesome game and It's been a lot of fun."
101,2701,"It's like NANDGame with a prettier interface, freedom to customize your architecture and define your own asm opcodes, and a couple of ASM code golf challenges near the end. Very fun!"
102,2701,"helpful, instructive and makes the intuition behind computer works"
103,2701,"Good game, it gets hard but it's worth it."
104,2701,"I've always wanted to get into games like this and MHRD, but have always been too intimidated. This game makes itself accessible without sacrificing any of what makes these kinds of games great. I've been playing a ton and enjoying every bit of it. The dev is super responsive when it comes to any bugs or any feedback. This is a fantastic game that I can see myself spending a ton more time in."
105,2701,Very fun. Challenging and satisfying when you finally figure it out. This is a great game to teach anyone about programming. A severe lack of hints but I'm not sure adding more hints or tutorials would make the game better.
106,2701,"This is a neutral review.This is a decent discrete circuit puzzler. Things I liked:* Some nice ""aha"" moments while building gates.* Challenging puzzles.Things I didn't like:* The art style of the alien, and everything related to the story and its jokes.* Menial labor puzzles.* No music, though at later levels you will be too busy thinking to care.* Over the top assembly programming puzzles.A word of warning:I don't believe that a person without some background related to either discrete logic chip circuits or computer programming will be able to finish this. Later levels feature programming in assembly where you control some things, and while was able to solve those because I have years of computer programming skills, I don't see how someone without programming experience could POSSIBLY ever solve that level.  Up to that point, the game presented some nice moments that gave me insights into circuit design (for some reason I never tried to build xor out of nands before. Not sure why), however the difficulty levels are a mixed bag.There are puzzles which require you to think hard.There are puzzles which are completely bland and menial, those involve byte operations. ""implement <operation> for two bytes"" are all done the same way, by splitting the bytes into bits, and performing the operation on the bits. Absolutely unfun.Then there's raw memory programming/assembly puzzles. Those... were incredibly difficult, but at the same time unenjoyable. Because you're programming in an ancient dialect without any of the helper tools. I did this sort of thing as a kid, and I realize this isn't a lot of fun now, especially when jmp cannot use relative addresses.At a plus side, this game REALLY makes you build your own very basic cpu, and then you see this thing put together, and come to life, in a ""It's alive!"" frankenstein moment. That moment was amusing.However, I highly doubt that this can work as an education tool. As some other comment said ""this game does not explain and does not teach, but expects you to figure it out"". If you have some related background, then you'll probably figure it out. If you don't... I'd expect you to get stuck."
107,2701,"I recommend this if you have experience in computing, if not i might recommend you try TIS-100 first(The programming portion of this makes a lot of assumptions on your knowledge). If you are very patient you may be able to learn from these puzzles but the way information is presented is incredibly brief.I expected a learning portion then a puzzle portion. But this tries to teach through puzzles which works 75% of the time, the other 25% is pain.Im sure the dev will improve it with time & at the moment i am 80% done with the game..soo it is achievable & a fulfilling ride.On a side note : If anyone wants to try there hand at programming a replica, the book ""Digital Computer Electronics""  is more or less this game but with actual components that you can buy or simulate."
108,2701,"excellent game, very few bugs and will teach some interesting things to a fair few people"
109,2701,"If you love computers or electronics like I do, you will like this game. It features a variety of puzzles where you can learn the basics of a computer."
110,2701,"I've taken a computer logic course, and while this neglects a lot of the math and good design practice, it was way more fun just figuring it out for myself. If you're into to computers and hardware stuff this is a pretty fun game and you can actually learn things through trial and error. However it's not going to hold your hand which may turn off anyone who is just looking at this as a puzzle game."
111,2701,"I am an old software developer yet have also dabbled on and off with micro-controllers and other hardware stuff over the years. This is not a game and not quite a teaching device, and yet, I've had so much fun working through the levels, and learned more about basic computer architecture than I ever thought I would need.  I disagree with those comments/reviews that have rated Turing Complete poorly. It's open access and a Beta, so there are going to be a whole bunch of things that are not not yet perfect or balanced. For example, I find it annoying developing a customer circuit, yet not being able to use it as a component in certain levels, so I find myself creating sub optimal solutions. These quirks and issues are to be expected.With that said, until I started using Turing Complete, I never truly appreciated the complexity and genius behind even the simplest microprocessors until I had spent these hours trying to solve problems which teach me to better understand how the various elements grow from simple gates into ever more complex systems. I had also given up really getting to grips with learning assembly, and then was presented an opportunity to work through an assembly exercise. Sure it is really rudimentary, and yet it gives me better insight and has helped me to get over a learning hurdle that always held me back from trying to understand it.This program doesn't really teach you anything beyond several basic concepts, and it certainly will not turn you into a hardware engineer. What it does do, however, is challenge you to find a way to solve increasingly difficult problems while emulating rudimentary computer electronics, and to find satisfaction in doing so. It also provides a practical use to apply all of that Boolean algebra that they teach in computer science classes, and for us programmers, working with low level logic in this manner can teach us a different way to approach our conditional statements in our day to day code. This software is also a great primer for anyone writing software, because it gives us a greater appreciation of what the software is doing in the hardware, and how to deal with resource and functional limitations. You will not be given any answers, and you may need to experiment a little, yet with patience and the application of a little logic, every level has a fairly straightforward solution, and will support many configurations to get there.So no, this is not a game for people who want to just play games. It is a great series of puzzles for IT people, or people who want to understand computers and hardware a little more. So it is a bit of a niche game, yet certainly one I would recommend to anyone who really wants to sink their teeth into something technical, challenging, and what I would call ""geek fun""."
112,2701,"This game is a dream come true for me, because it lets me build a whole computer from scratch, simulate it, and understand every part of it.  Though it is definitely Early Access and has a long way to go for Quality-of-Life features, the core of the game is already solid and immensely satisfying.The simulation is fast, the editor good enough, the visual feedback pleasing and informative, but above all, the level design is excellent.  It gives you just enough a slice of the overall problem that it never feels too far out of reach.  Levels build on each other in a non-linear but logical way.  If you get stuck, real-world research will actually help you here, unlike some other similar games.  It doesn't place draconian restrictions on your solutions, so you're free to get there as efficiently or inefficiently as you want.  But either way, you're building every new component yourself, either directly or by solving a core problem which it just extends to a larger quantity to remove excessive drudge work.A+ and I look forward to how this evolves throughout Early Access.  Bravo, LevelHead!  :D"
113,2701,"Firm Meh.UI needs a lot of work in terms of getting out of the way. I shouldn't have to look up spoilers to understand basic functionality of puzzles like what the input values are, or what the output pins of the last version work."
114,2701,"Very geeky stuff, but also very interesting.Work pretty well, much better than expected.The microprocessor design seems a bit awkward, but, I expect, it will work."
115,2701,"Fun & Good challenges. I know already that this game is gonna make me rage and weirdly, i love it."
116,2701,"Good puzzle game, however it could do some more teaching."
117,2701,literally wanted this kinda game since I was like 11 or something :D
118,2701,"Really fun and educational game if you're interested in how a computer can be built out of basic components. You can see it as a puzzle game or as an educational game. The game seems quite polished, even though it's early access. (I'm about halfway through at the time of writing, about at the first 'working computer' stage.)"
119,2701,This is probably the best programming game out there. Everyone likes to praise a certain game developer whose name starts with Zach but this game is better than any other such game. This is basically everything you ever hoped a programming game could be. You go from low level logic circuits all the way to a functioning CPU you can program. You won't be disappointed if you buy this. The community is great and helpful and the developer is very responsive. I've long wanted to make my own programming game but I'm not quite sure the world needs another one after this game. This may be as close to perfection as we ever see.
120,2701,"Very similar to nand to tetris but in game form which is great. Needs some polish/instructions to direct the players more though. You should be fine on your own, but If you follow the book nand to tetris, the book how computers really work or Ben Eaters youtube videos, you should have a better understanding of what you are doing. Would be great if it was open source since this would be an amazing educational tool for public schools (I can dream ;) )."
121,2701,"Had a blast with this. It can be a bit of a headache on some levels when you are trying to get started and it isn't exactly clear how you are supposed to achieve it. Both the 'Negative numbers' and 'Wire spaghetti' levels had me pulling my hair out for a while just trying to get started, but figuring out where the stuff is tucked away in the interface is part of the enjoyment. Not to mention getting to the point where you can actually write code to run on the system you designed."
122,2701,I literally sat down and did nothing but think for like 30 minutes trying to beat a level and wasn't even bored very cool gameEdit after finishing all except assembly challenges:This is game teaches all about how early computers worked in a simplified but not 2 simplified way. It guides you through each step of building a computer and then creating assembly code with your computer to solve puzzlesI very much recommend this even if you're like me and had no circuit experience before starting
123,2701,Excellent game
124,2701,"Very challenging puzzle game that will not hold your hand, but is framed in a way that guides you along to some very cool and interesting insight into how electronics work. Highly recommend for anyone that likes puzzles or are interested in computing. If you don't fall into either of those categories I would probably stay away."
125,2701,"I think this is THE BEST GAME at it's genre! let's talk about it.First about the negatives:A couple of bugs here and there, uncomfortalbe controls. This game needs some polishing, but I guess that's what early access is for.If you expect this game to ""teach"" you, as teachers do in school, you will not learn much. This game just throws you into the problem and expects you to find the answer by yourself. It requires a specific mindset to play this game. Lot's of patience and trial and error.The game will not teach you, but will give you an apportunity to teach yourself.The game sometimes doesn't dive you enough tools. For example, there's an AND gate that has 2 inputs and 1 output. There's Also an 8 bit version of that gate, it takes 2 bytes and outputs 1 byte (puts each pair of bits into it's own AND gate). It's very simple to build such component. BUT the game then asks you to build such component for mostly every single gate. I already know how to copy and paste a simple gate 8 times to get a byte gate, JUST UNLOCK ALL BYTE GATES.Also the game just doen't give you the tools that you should already have by this point. It doesn't have a 1 bit Multiplexer, Multiplexers that take 2-3 address bits. The 1 bit DEMUX is NOT WHAT A DEMULTIPLEXER IS. it's just plain wrong.Some unnecesary mindless tasks, and lack of components.Now the POSITIVES!:While the early game is exactly the same as all other games in this genre, the END GAME IS SO RICH! MHRD stops when you make a CPU and forces you into a predefined architecture Nandgame stopps after the first assemly puzzle and forces you into a predefined architecture THIS GAME DOESN'T STOP AND GIVES YOU SO MUCH ENGINEERING FREEDOM.After a certain poin the game enters a ""sandbox"" mode. Your solution carries from previous puzzle to the next one, you build a CPU level by level and you get to keep all your beautifull wire mess. the game asks you to calulate some outputs based on inputs and how you do it is ENTIRELY up to you. You build your own architecture! You are the boss! If you don't like the path the the game leads you, just do whatever you feel like. As long as you generate correct outputs you're good!CUSTOM ASSEMBLER!!! WHAT!!!?You can make ""constants"" that translate words into binary. Let's say you need a SET command. You add a constant SET and set it to 0100 0000. Now every time you write SET in your code it will be replaced by it's binary. (sadly you are limited to 1 byte but that's okay). Then all your commands get loaded into ROM one by one as bytes. if you write ""ADD regA regB regC"", the game will load ""0, 1, 2, 3"" into the ROM (or whatever is the number representation)Programming challenges!That's THE JUICE of the game! Why would you need a CPU if you can't use it? You'll get solve famous classic problems like: maze solver, Tower of Hanoi, Sorting, Stack, Random Number Generator, and more! Some of those challenges are VERY difficult and it means that you need a proper CPU to solve them! And that's you motivation! EstheticsWhile you can just beeline all you component connections together, it will look very ugly in the end. That's why you naturally want to make you designs look clean. No other game in this genre does this. You can bend wires in 90 or 45 degree turns and make you CPU look structuraly pleasing. (look at screenshots at my profile or trailer images). Numbers flow, Indicators flash. You can clearly see what is going on at any point."
126,2701,"Awesome game, quite a lot of content for an EA game but leaves me wanting more.If you like Zachatronics games  you will probably like thisIt has a cool feature of building components that you use in later levels, and I'd love to see more levels to utilise this feature further"
127,2701,About 50% way through the puzzles so far and really enjoying it. Something I've always thought about making myself after reading the NAND to Tetris book. Glad somebody else put in the effort. Seems fully playable from what I've seen so far. Could use a little polish here and there but frankly it's a ton of fun even in it's current state.
128,2701,"While it's wonderful to learn how computers work, for a game that is graphically this simple, the performance is unacceptable. Even at the beginner levels you can see in task manager and that godot engine is putting enormous drain on both CPU and GPU. At intermediate levels the game starts to stutter."
129,2701,"Store Page says - ""This is a hard game, but computer knowledge is not a prerequisite.""Devs are correct, computer knowledge is not required.. some knowledge of computer science and logic circuits / gates is absolutely required. K-Maps and boolean algebra would also help either :)Game is quite difficult, interface is a little awkward and needs some improvements.I'd like to be able to add notes NOT constrained to circuit paths (like sticky note on certain areas).Something that that is absolutely required is some documentation or a basic overview of all the components, gates and such so folks that haven't gone the SET education route can understand what they are doing and why things be as they do."
130,2701,Like Shenzhen i/o for those who prefer to earn their steam achievements the hard way.
131,2701,"As mentioned by others, this game literally throws you into boolean algebra from the beginning, then you proceed to operations with bytes, working with memory and simple arithmetic operations (I'm here at ths moment), eventually you will get to creating a simple computer, then to programming and so on. The most satisfying thing in the game is that you start only with ""NAND"" logic gate and create all the other gates step-by-step. From a single gate to a computer. This is astonishing.But the only thing why I truly enjoy the game is that I'm studying in a university on IT speciality and I already know how all this stuff works: how to design circuits, simplify boolean expressions, and how to code things. It is still isn't easy though, because sometimes I just don't understand what the game wants me to do. But this is early access, so it will be better in future. Also there are no complete guides for levels and the in-game tutorial is enough only if you already somewhat know the subject. In case you don't, the game literally says that you should ""experiment"". If you are familiar at least with boolean algebra, basic logic operations, karnaugh maps and fine with that nothing will help you during your journey - buy this game. This is challenging and has a great educational potential if you are bright enough to comprehend. If you are not an engineer in your soul, don't waste your time. You will not understand what you should do here, and the game explains almost nothing. There are no fancy graphics nor music, only sketchy inputs, outputs and gates, that you place and connect on a scheme, and this is both extremely mind-breaking and purely magnificent its simplicity."
132,2701,The best headache I've ever had
133,2701,"If you're a programmer, or you liked games like infinifactory or spacechem, try this game.Learn to build logic circuits then an entire computer - from  the ground up! Using the logic circuits you designed.Suggestion for dev:Instead of pressing ALT then LMouse to draw wires, and LMouse to scroll  the map, I suggest you use left mouse to draw wires,  and RMouse to scroll the map. This would be MUCH easier and save a lot of clicks - and seems more natural too."
134,2701,"FINALLY!  A game that actually challenges you.  This game absolutely DOES NOT deserve down voted due to its difficulty, it is clearly stated several times in the description that it is NOT EASY (seriously how can you buy a game that says its hard, then down vote it for being so?).  More importantly, this game would not be what it was without that difficulty, figuring it out on your own is 90% of the fun.  The help you get is more akin to a users manual, which i find to be quite immersive.  Anything you really can't figure out can be found online and learned as if you weren't playing the game.  A tutorial or ""more help"" would only take from this game, not add to it.The minimal story this game has is perfect as well, it adds humor and linearity without taking too much from the games core.  If you enjoy a challenge, logic puzzles, or are curious about computers I highly recommend this game."
135,2701,As a computer nerd this is one of the coolest games EVER!
136,2701,"Solving this game's problems feels so rewarding. This is a must play for anyone with an interest in the fundamentals of computer science, I am so glad I stumbled upon it."
137,2701,"The major flaw with this game is that it doesn't actually teach you anything, it just tells you to figure it all out by experimenting. Learning discrete logic merely via experimentation will lead to wrong assumptions, inefficient implementations and confusion along the line. The game can work as a learning tool alongside proper external instructional materials, however other circuit simulators are already available for free."
138,2701,It is very good for an early access game. So far i have no complaints apart from the interface being a bit unintuitive.
139,2701,This might be one of the most important educational games ever made. It's also really fun. I'm recommending it to all my STEM inclined students!
140,2701,HOLY SHHHHH** this game is good. Im still a noob! but im learning soooooo much
141,2701,"I agree with the other comments that this is not as polished as the Zachtronics offerings. To a certain extent it scratches the same itch, but it has major shortcomings.I'm writing this as both an educator and having education in electronics.This smells like educational software, though (a) it doesn't teach you the simple tools that you learn in college to solve problems like these (Karnaugh, De Morgan), and (b) it relies on an unstated, undemonstrated assumption that all output drivers are high-side open-drain. In a game where all concepts are learned by demonstration, this one crucial assumption is not demonstrated, and then makes levels like Tangled Gates and One-Way nonsensical - particularly to people who already have knowledge of electronics.The UI is slightly clunky. Drawing a byte bus has an animation (good) that assumes that the user's drawing direction is the actual direction of data flow (bad). The user can't do simple left-click selection of wires or buses, and only nodes are selectable/movable. Neither the level map nor the editor support zoom. Some of this is excusable because the game is an early release.One major annoyance is that the simulation halts as soon as the first failure is encountered. This prevents seeing the whole behaviour of the circuit and fine-tuning it for specific edge cases.The assembly editor supports arithmetic expressions (good) that are evaluated left-to-right with no regard for operator precedence (bad). The author and I have agreed to disagree on this topic - he thinks fixing this implies a new feature, and I think it's a bug. This is significant because it constrains what is already a very constrained assembly editor that doesn't support defining bitfields or arguments of any kind. Also, if this game is to be interpreted as educational software, users will be learning the wrong thing about algebraic expressions.Overall it's salvageable and I'll be happy to change my recommendation after more polish."
142,2701,"You start from the very basics of computing, flip-flops, NAND, NOR gates and build on those simple foundations right up to (where I'm currently at) assembly language for a computer you've (mostly) built yourself from those basic parts, writing a program to control a robot in Space Invaders (here called rat infestation) and guiding the same robot through a maze.It gives you a fundamental knowledge on how magically a CPU is and also how it is not. And almost from the electrics right up to writing code. Brilliant!For me, who started my ""professional"" career writing Zilog Z-80 assembly games on a ZX-81 clone back in the early 80's this ""game"" is just amazing and so hard to leave when I get too tired.My biggest complaint is that I'll reach the end (soon) ;)"
143,2701,"This is a lot of fun - now I can pretend to be Ben Eater without actually getting any breadboards!If you've finished MHRD and were sad that you couldn't then go ahead and actually write programs for your computer, then you should get a real kick out of this.  I'm still working my way through the various levels at the moment so I should probably come back and update this review later on, but for now while I am at the point of having built a computer from NAND gates and then used it to implement a maze solving algorithm written using assembly of my own devising, this is an easy recommendation even before I've seen the rest of the things which are teased in the trailer."
144,2701,"Overall great, I love the idea we are building a computer from the ground up.  I like that it can be educational as well as entertaining.What i have issues with not understanding how somethings work.  Example: Flip Flop circuits I fail to understand on a level where i can effectively employ them and it becomes a bit of trial and error.I am reviewing the early release so hopefully it gets better, either way i would still recommend this, frustration and all!"
145,2701,"Way too hard, basically zero proper explanation on how the Flip Flop things work, and also no help on the internet yet. Maybe I'll be sometime buy it again when it actually has help builtin, but for now I requested a refund. It's really just frustrating once you get to the memory section and do not already know everything about it."
146,2701,"Very well-thought and executed intro to logic gates, circuitry, CPU architecture, assembly and low-level programming.As of early access, might still need a little polish, but overall experience is not hindered or disrupted by small bugs here and there.If you liked TIS-100, Shenzhen I/O and Exapunks from Zachtronics, you're likely to enjoy same deal but also building your hardware from ground up."
147,2701,"Absolutely fantastic game. The game does not require a computer science degree, but I brought one anyway and frankly came away with a deeper understanding of how computers work that I never really got in school. Building a basic computer is such a rewarding experience, and I want more people to have access to it. The narrative is pretty funny."
148,2701,"Managed to make me redo my computer science homework and make it fun. I'm heavily invested now, almost made my way up to a complete computer and looking forward to achieving that."
149,2701,i waited for a game such as this one for a long time. 100% worth the money.
150,2701,"very challenging, but also very fun"
151,2701,Screw you! Making me learn an . I stayed up all night designing rudimentary computer hardware. It was fun and all but... I'm so tired.
152,2701,"Good game. I like the concept - build everything from just bunch of NAND's. But the game is still buggy and unpolished (maybe it will be fixed before release). I doubt this game can be used as a learning tool - too complex for newbies. But if you like this sort of stuff (and know at least a little about it) you will have a REALLY good time.Notes for devs: Worst thing is - you dont have access to custom modules in early game, and even already finished predefined modules (like big DEMUX) are not always available (why?!!) and you're forced to implement them from the scratch again and again. Not fun. UI for binary coding is not really comfortable - why not just show command descripion for bytes in memory directly? Having separate window for command assembly and copying it in memory bit by bit is annoying."
153,2701,"This is the first time I have ever implemented a CLA and liked doing it :) seriously though, there is an amazing thrill when you get to the final levels, implementing algorithms in an assembly language that you wrote atop an architecture you build using components you designed. The tower of construction gives this unique feeling that is unparalleled in other games of this genre. Once this leaves Early Access, it will be the next best thing to building a computer Ben Eater style on a breadboard."
154,2701,"Absolutely the most authentic feeling ""build a computer from almost scratch and then program it"" game I've played yet!"
155,2701,"I really like this game, It has its issues, but updates so far have been pretty frequent, and they have been adding nice features. While the description says no knowledge needed, that's not entirely true. I would have been totally lost had I not watched all of Ben Eaters videos on YouTube on his breadboard computer. As the game stands right now, I'm happy with my purchase. Having said that, there are a numbers of improvements I would like to see, a bit too many to list here. This game has a lot of potential to be fantastic, and I very much hope they continue to build on what they have,I have been wanting to build a breadboard computer myself, but the parts are really expensive, and this game is a fantastic alternative to that. I've been stumped a few times, but I've made some good progress so far. It is very satisfying when you finally get the solution to a problem you have been working on."
156,2701,good progressional difficulty and attainment of complex tools
157,2701,Great test of logic. Also a good way to learn the basics of digital signals. Looking forward to progressing through the levels.
158,2701,"It's very good, there are a few bugs and a few quality of life issues but I don't think that they break the game at all"
159,2700,"If you ever wanted to build a full turing-complete redstone computer in Minecraft but didn't want to place all the blocks and worry about signal strength, this is the game for you.The best description I have of the game is ""guided top-down, grid-based circuit simulator"" and it honestly is exactly that."
160,2700,"Few bugs (like components disappearing out of schematics here and there), but all in all found myself completely engrossed for the first computer building bit. Getting that working computer was a massive nerd boner.If you're interested in the subject matter and like building things, you'll love this game. Building the computer starting from only NAND gates was a thoroughly enjoyable experience. Wholly recommend this game."

169,2700,What a fantastic little game!Completely blew away my expectations after being left disappointed by several other similar digital logic games. This is hands down by far the most fun I've had in the genre. The only thing I'd ask for more is more crazy sandbox endgame puzzles and Zach-like leaderboard graphs.
170,2700,"What an amazing game!!!Sure theres room for some polishing during EA after all thats the purpose of it, but the essence of the game, the heart, the idea and vision, are already implemented there.Seen some reviews telling about poor story but personally I found it fun. Its lighthearted nature comes as a relief between levels where we burn our brains out. Also the possibility to change each signal at a time and see the results I found to be charming and fits the game really well.This truly applies:The best moments in the game is when the solution to a puzzle makes you realize the deep nature of something you took for granted.Entertaining and fun!! Definitely recommended.Cheers "

181,2700,"This game is really fun!Despite having completed over 4 years of computer engineering classes from my university, this game has forced me to look at certain aspects of digital logic design from a new perspective.It is a great entry point to learn how computers work from digital logic to machine code to assembly programming (although it could do with a more in-depth section on truth tables/k-mapping in my opinion).The game focuses on self-teaching by means of experimentation, and rewards success without punishing for failure. Because of this it feels like a Zachtronics game to me (at least with how the gameplay feels), but all of the complexity is hidden behind very friendly graphics that I could imagine an elementary school teacher hanging in her classroom.Spoiler warning:There are several characters in the game (although to my knowledge you only speak to one) and the world that they build is a fairly humorous one. The premise is that you have been abducted by an alien race in order to participate in a gameshow. If you are able to make a working computer, you win, and if you don't, you get eaten. Several animals from earth have failed, and some have done very well. One that failed to create a computer was a dog named Snuffles that the aliens decided was too cute to eat.In this game, you design *everything*. There are hints if you get stuck, but other than being given a NAND gate and pre-built memory blocks, you design a fully working computer. *You* decide what operations your ALU has. *You* decide the internals of an OR gate. *You* decide what machine code does what. *You* decide what assembly instructions correspond to what machine code. *You* decide what code your computer runs.You decide.

202,2700,This game is awesome! I love it
203,2700,Great logic game
204,2700,"The problem with this game is that it doesn't teach you. It just shows you puzzles and wants you to figure them out. That is fine when you are designing simple gates, but when you are supposed to design multiplexer you still rely on the same ""just try something"". It mentions Karnaugh maps in manual, citing: ""There is a trick one can use called a Kamaugh map, which will let you find simple solutions to truth tables. You may want to look up Kamaugh maps online, althoth you have already completed the levels where this would have been most useful.""which is said after designing XOR or gate of similar complexity. It even discards it as ""well, you prolly wont need it anymore anyway"", but then it wants multiplexer and without karnaugh map its just a chore leading to highly inefficient circuits at best.Devs should throw away the ""you have been abducted, now make a computer"" and instead provide teaching narrative which would make harder puzzles solvable."
205,2700,"You make a computer from NAND gates up. Honestly, that description is enough to tell you if you will like this game or not. It is exactly what it says on the tin."

207,2700,"As a simulation/teaching tool, it's virtually flawless, but as a learning tool for the uninitiated on Boolean logic, well... not so good. EDIT: ...but, it's getting there with each update.Verdict: Highly recommended."
208,2700,I don't sure that It's a game or a computer architecture quiz lol. but I recommend it for anyone who's interested in Basic Computer System and Architecture or Logic. It's still fun and challenges you.
209,2700,"I do not recommend this game. 1. I was banned from the community hub for being ""Too negative"" with no further explanation from the developer. (All of my posts were deleted, most of them suggestions or bugs. None of them were worded to be insulting to the game or to the developer)2. The game is incredibly buggy and lacking a ton of very necessary features. Feels like the whole game was just kind of jumbled together. The color pallet for the wires is awful, there's blue, light blue, purple, light purple, green, light green, bright yellow (Which all look incredibly similar), white, and orange.3. Undo is bugged to all heck. Most of the time during the late-game it just crashes the game or freezes up for 10 seconds before letting you resume.4. A lot of levels lack description and/or other necessary pointers to get new players on track for the more advanced components. (Side tutorials for components, better level explanations, etc.)5. The tests are incredibly hard to debug, if you get one part of the test wrong it sends you entirely back to the first tick, and if you try to place a wire or component down all of the inputs/outputs reset so you can't even see what you got wrong.--------------------------------------------------------If the dev didn't want feedback on his game, he should not have made a game."
210,2700,"I'm enjoying running through this game and am learning quite a bit so far, while I did study software engineering at uni I missed learning about these sort of hardware focused concepts completely. I can definitely empathise with some of the reviews calling out needing more hand holding as I'm struggling on some of them and I have a good understanding of the software side (boolean logic, binary, etc.). Hopefully the tutorial will be built out during early access.Recommended to someone who want to learn this stuff, has the patience to learn it and doesn't mind searching out of game for guidance when needed."
211,2700,"Great game, well executed."
212,2700,Love this its hard enough but for real its really fun
213,2700,"I'm really loving this game so far. I tend to like Zachtronics games up the point where they start to feel like actual work. When that happens, I usually end up stopping and going and working on an actual project of some kind. But this game sets itself apart by having a really nice set of challenges that all build on top of each other to walk you through from wires to a computer. The (minimal) story is also fun and funny, and the presentation is well done. It also gets bonus points from me for having been built with the Godot engine.Awesome work all around, and if you like Zachtronics style games, and/or want a nice guided tour of how wires can do math and implement logic, you should check this out."
214,2700,"Absolutely brilliant.  Never had this much fun before with an educational game.  However, you might want to take a quick refresher on Boolean logic before playing."

218,2700,"Even though there have been a few other attempts on Steam to gamify the same topic (building a computer from basic logic gates), this iteration is graphically polished and well thought out, despite being in 'early access.' The interface (sort of a sandbox electronic board) takes a few minutes to get used to, and with intuitive drags and drops, and input settings, it turns into a potentially very valuable hands-on learning experience (if one is willing to put in some brain, since there would be no point at all in having hands held in a game like this).There's a humorous 'story' tying the challenges together, and surely it doesn't hurt :)Caveat should be that someone who is completely new to logic gates and binary is most likely going to have a hard time, save for being a Turing reincarnation (in which case I suspect there is some government agency somewhere ready to hire you)."

Puzzle solving and real world relation - done sharply. Kudos!Be sure to review the long time players too - those reviews were helpful in deciding to purchase as well."

You will like this too.If you have zero idea about logic gates, how bits and bytes works, 2's complement etc.... It will be a step learning curve but 100% worth it."
229,2700,"Feels more like a course, than a puzzle video game. There's some 'funny' as a character introducing the lessons, is trying to be funny - but IMO, it absolutely doesn't fit the mood or the ""gameplay"", and game should just be honest to what it is.Aside that - controls are great, making circuits and testing stuff is easy.The downside - it scales up very quickly and you're going to hit complex circuitry with very little explanation soon. Memorizing the truth tables is easy, but what's never explained -which I believe should be a must- is how to connect gates to get different behaviour that you might be seeking.Still - one of a kind ""game"", that will really teach you how to build your own computer from logic gates, and as the game itself says - the real gain is the knowledge, not in achievements.Worth the money!"
230,2700,"This is awesome,  I really love that tip!"
231,2700,"Absolutely brilliant.  Never had this much fun before with an educational game.  However, you might want to take a quick refresher on Boolean logic before playing."
232,2700,"It is possible to invent a single machine which can be used to compute any computable sequence. If this machine U is supplied with a tape on the beginning of which is written the S.D [""standard description"" of an action table] of some computing machine M, then U will compute the same sequence as Alan Turing."
233,2700,"I was interested in this game as soon as i saw it on zachtronics similar session.You see, at first glance, the game isn't so good, the UI needs alot of work, its kinda ugly.The levels at the beginning are a bit boring, but OH BOY, as soon as i got to ""counting signals"", i started doing all kinds of wacky designs and when i got it right suddenly got a blast of exciment and i spent 5 minutes admiring my circuit in awe and admiration of my creationi've even took a screenshot https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2617723939good game, if you overlook it visuals is a hell of a zach-like, on my top 10, for sure.Works natively on linux ;)"
234,2700,"Zachtronics but better?The only disappointing thing is the lack of any soundtrack whatsoever, but hopefully EA will fix this."
235,2700,"10/10 wondeful gme, run on linuxif i click lmb and rmb at the same time the game breaks"
236,2700,"Yes, a thousand times Yes!I haven't gone too deep into this ""game"" but this is exactly what I like. I am studying computer science and understand a lot of the inner workings of a computer, but sometimes.. just sometimes.. the gates inside a CPU confuses me, Here I have a tool that teaches from the ground up what is actually happening. It asks you to combine gates to obtain a certain output, so you have to think hard, it can get daunting sure and you maybe tempted to look it up on the interwebs, but I suggest you stick with it, leave it take a break and come back to it if it is troubling you, the satisfaction of working it out yourself is a great feeling and gives you more deeper understanding what is going on inside a computer.That being said its not going to ruin your experience if you do your homework first, maybe you can follow Ben Eater's breadboard computer a lot more by playing this ""game"". Is it a Game? or is it a Tool? Its fun either way!Whats more I believe its a single developer who is very active in the community forums so that again puts a win in for me.- Although I have recently learned that the developer has banned a friend on steam for misunderstanding their posts for bugs and suggestions, and has been banned for ""being too negative"" So basically if you want to take part in the discussion boards for this game, make sure to only say good things about the game."
237,2700,"I can wholeheartedly recommend this learning software to anyone with an interest in digital electronics, it is a great and marvelous educational game with puzzles, a bit of humor and a wonderful painless interface which ties it all together. There are a lot of levels and I am sure it will hold your attention for a long time!"
