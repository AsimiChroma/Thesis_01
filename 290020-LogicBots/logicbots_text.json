Not because this game is better than every other game I have played, but because I feel like there needs to be more people playing this so that it can really go far.This game (if you can call it that, more on that later) might be in Early Access, but it is one of the most complete games I've played in early access. I have only ran into one bug that happened twice in my first 10 hours of game play. That bug being that it crashed when starting the simulation. Otherwise everything works as expected. The reason I would maybe not consider calling this a game is because its not designed to be some easy pickup and play. Its a robot simulator, well maybe not even that. Its a circuit simulator that happens to have robots.If you dont understand Boolean operators, AND, OR, NOT, or XOR then this game might not be for you. This really did take me back to basic circuit building.There is only a sandbox piece to the circuit building. To use the robots you have to play through all the levels and unlock the components. Another downside is there is almost no community around this game as of this writing, so if you get stuck on a level your SOL. At least for now, I really hope that changes and we see a bigger community.Go play it! Have fun building and then re-building.","First off I been on Steam for a really long time, and this is the first time I have written a review.

The game has improved, with community features such as Steam Workshop now built-in to the game, more fun things to do, and an optimized core for smooth play. This is a fantasic game for builders, thinkers and puzzlers, but don't just take my word for it, read what my former-self said about the game before it weas even complete:What is LogicBots? This is a sandbox simulation where you get to build autonomous robots to do your bidding. The core gameplay is a huge set of 'levels', each with several potential goals. You review your objective(s), then with a set budget and assortment of bot-bits and coloured wires you set-out to custom-build a bot-to-order. The construction requires both the physical conformation as well as a circuitboard with the logic-gates that define how your bot's inputs manipulate it's outputs. Once you think you've got the right mix of form and function, you press a button and the simulation takes over: your assembled bot is thrown into the level and left to it's own devices.Each level's 'sub-quests' will futher challenge your imagination as you work to improve your bot and are forced to dream of more efficient and clever ways to achieve your goals. If you want to play socially, it's fairly easy to export\/import your bots to share with friends - the game generates a PNG thumbnail and XML text file that makes it a snap.Although this game is still in 'beta' it has kept me challenged and engaged for hours on end. While there is a steep learning curve for a person like me, the challenge doesn't become stale. I've always been a fan of sandbox games, so I'm sure I'm a bit biased, but this game has huge potential. The developer is active in the Steam Community forums (Fall 2014) and very responsive to feedback.Undoubtedly worth the current $20 buy-in if you enjoy games that challenge your mind.

In a way its a successor to the old gem \"Mind Rover\", where one built bots to do various tasks in a similar manner.Th basic premsie is, using boolean logic gates, sensors, motors and various widgets, to accomplish a series of puzzles with robots. The graphics are simple but serviceable, but the audience for the this game is probably not gonna be swayed by the graphics much anyway.Its a fantastic teaching game for those new to propositional logic, and great for all the tinkerers out there. My only complaint, and rumor has it its being worked on, is the interface is a bit clunky. But, for an early access game its remarkably polished, Ive only run into one minor bug so far where it got confused after I deleted a sensor.Anyways, its a great game and logic\/teaching toy and I can't wait to see more come out of it.","First review I've written, cause I want this game to get more attention.

Since that time this issue has been fixed and now the simulation is much more reliable thus my change of not recommended to recomended. I never had an issue with the game play itself, it was enjoyable, it was purely the unreliability of the simulation that made this game as good as Bad Ratz, now that that issue seems to be fixed I can give it a reccomendation.###############Original Review#############While the game is fun and interesting to play unfortinatly I can not currently reccomend buying this game. I enjoy these type of games, and this one has potential but with one major turnoff in its current state, the same turnoff that made Bad Rats a bad game... you can run the exact same robot with making zero changes what so ever and get three entirely different results. It seems the calculations are tied to the frame rate, but when VSync enabled still bounces the frame rate between 60-61 (200+ with Vsync disabled) that 1 FPS bouncing back and forth at different times ends up making the same robot without being modified at all do different things each time.If they can get the Bad Rats issue out of this game I would fully recommend it, but when a game about making minor tweaks to fix issues can not even keep the same results when running the same thing over and over it makes it more of a game of luck then of actually making the perfect tweaks.It has potential, it is fun even with that issue, but I just can not recommend it fully until that gets sorted out."],["Working good...

Chassis, wheels, various bits of metal beats, sensors, etc.  The logic part is pretty limited, which is part of the challenge: it's quite a bit harder to program collision avoidance with a few basic logic gates than an Arduino.  That's part of the challenge, and if you don't enjoy that, you might not find this as fun as, say, Matlab.  But I'm enjoying it.It isn't yet polished, and I find some of the construction process tricky due to UI limitations ... but I have yet to find an actual bug in the game, which is refreshing."],["Definitely the best robot building game available!"],["This is a terrific simulation of robotics and circuit board logic programming disguised as a game; but a GREAT GAME! If you want to challenge your brain for a mere fraction of the cost of acquiring a robotics kit and electronics you are in for a real treat. I just got this title a few days ago, but I'm already finding myself staying awake just to try out my latest idea to improve my design or to solve the puzzles with multiple designs. I have yet to try out the sandbox mode, but am really looking forward to it. Great job Incandescent Games for bringing this title to the masses! Thank you!","I have been considering getting a raspberry pi computer and a robots kit to build a mobile weather station (my own 'Mars rover') just for fun. But I hesitate to spend a couple of hundred dollars on a project that I might not have the talent or persistence to complete. Then I saw logicbots on Steam. For a fraction of the cost of real parts I could practice building robots and circuits before laying down the serious money.   I am only three hours into the game, but I can already see it meets my expectations. The tutorial is a very good introduction to boolean logic and simple circuit board construction. There is an extensive campaign with increasingly challenging tests, and a sandbox mode to just mess around.   Building the robots, and designing the control circuit is very interesting.The robots look realistic, and the building on the circuit boards has a simple but realistic feel. The only thing missing is writing code. The puzzles can all be solved by logic; unlike many puzzle games the difficulty is not created by making you try random guesses. The interface could be a little better designed: it often takes multiple clicks to do what I feel should be acomplished in one. But I haven't encountered any game breaking bugs.I have read several negative reviews that fault the game because there is a small random factor in the tests: what this means is that if you repeat the same test with the same robot you might get different results. This situation is described in the tutorial under the reliability heading, and ways to engineer around it are discussed. The random factor is a deliberate part of the game, to simulate real world situations. In the real world it is almost impossible to control all the variables, so real devices must be over engineered to cope with the unexpected. Personnaly I  like this approach.  This randomness is not just luck, it is a design challenge that can be overcome by careful analysis. However, if you are looking for a strictly mathematical game with no random factors, then you might find this approach to be annoying.I think the game is well worth the price if you are interested in programming and robotics. And much cheaper than the real thing.","Yay! It's another Zachtronics game!Wait a second, what do you mean this game wasn't made by Zachtronics?...Oh. Apparently it wasn't made by Zachtronics.

The game was very recently ported to Linux and as such I snapped it up immediately, I was not disappointed!The game is superbly well designed with a training area, a sandbox mode as well as a career mode with some pre-defined challenge levels in each with acheivements to complete (like time to complete, no of parts used and cost).  Those levels are pretty simple in the begining but quickly start providing more and more of a brain teaser as you go on.   There are five areas in the career mode and I have only just completed the last level in the first area today! The last level in the first area looks deceptively simple but is actually a real head scratcher when you start getting into the detail.Finding any negatives in this game is pretty hard I would say, it will obviously significantly tax your problem solving skills but realisitcally if you expected a game like this to be easy I would say you need to re-evaluate those expectations.  The only real negative I can think is that in order to progress to the next levels you cannot just complete the previous levels but must also have completed a certain number of acheivements in the earlier levels.  It might be nice to be able to progress to the next level without having to acheive a lot of the preceeding challenges first.  Still its a pretty small negative in the grand scheme of things and it may be possible the devs will amend this at some stage in the future.  I would say if you are looking for just a bit of fun with some robots the sandbox area will give you that and if you are looking for a real challenge for the mind then the career mode gives you that.  Overall the game is not only fun but gives a great experience in development and puzzle solving skills coupled with some genuine learning about electronics and robotics.  I can highly recommend this game, a well deserved 9\/10.Also as a last point if you are a Linux user I can confirm that this game worked flawlessly on my Debian based OS.

I'm an engineer by trade and this kind of game is right up my ally.  One of my favorite games of all time has been Banjo Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts if that gives you a hint into what I think is fun.I'm not going to call this a puzzle game or a programming game.  The puzzle is \"How do I beat this level?\"  The \"programming\" is figuring out which gates to use and how to wire them up.Here's what I do like:* It's an objective based robot creator!  It makes you use your mind to figure out how to beat each objective.  * There are tons of parts and logic board configurations that you can play with.What I don't like:* Levels get pretty tough to the point you want to just quit and you can't skip them.* Laying out wires should have been more of a click-and-drag function instead of a click-click function.  It's very difficult to see if the wiring post is clicked on or not.  Click on a post and drag it to another post would have been easier.* There is no ability to do a simulaton senor check without using a \"on\/off\" switch gate on your board, which takes up slot.  It is especially annoying when your board is near full with gates and you have to run wires too.  See above for why running wires is not a great method.  If an option was included to \"turn on the senor with a given input\" then it would really help trouble shooting your boards.  A little model of the bot doing the function in the corner would be great too instead of having to go to the actual challenge to troubleshoot.Little story for the last point... I was doing the level where you have to design the bot to turn when it reaches a colored wall.  Thankfully they set it up so that a left turn and a right turn had different colored walls.  If your bot goes off course onto the red flooring you would fail the challenge.  I kept trying to rig up the board to do a 90 deg turn with the gyros, with a count gate but I couldn't see what circuit board and values were doing.  Gist of the logic function I was going for - IF SENSOR IS ON COUNT TO 90 USING GYRO OUTPUT AND TURN THE CORRECT WHEEL AT THE SAME TIME THEN RESET COUNTER AND GO BACK TO BOTH WHEELS ON.  I finally had to setup another set of senors to adjust the wheel motor directions when they went over the red flooring because I couldn't see what the gyro and counter were outputting.For the current price, $20, it's not a bad game.

It is addictive and you have no idea where the time went...","Ive not only played this Game, I also have learned something and enjoyed it.Great Game but not easy."],["Without a doubt, the best game ever for eletronics lovers"],["Quite an excellent game for the puzzle-minded. You have to guide simple robots through obstacle courses, and do this by building basic circuit logic that they then have to follow, while utilizing motors and sensors and such so that your robot can navigate said courses. If you want a game that shows you how to use logic gates for basic robotics, and that gives you challenges all along the way to do so, then this game is for you. It ignores the annoyances that you might have to worry about \"in real life\" regarding things like circuit engineering (as far as electricity and such, voltages, etc). Yet you can combine circuit logic to do some pretty cool things. In the levels I have played so far, I have had to design robots that will navigate a maze of walls, that have had to follow lines, that have had to go around a curved table without falling off, that have had to follow a line to the end of an obstacle course without crashing into moving objects in front - etc. There's a fairly good variety in these levels, and solving them seems very simple in human terms, but getting the exact logic down so that your robot can do so is challenging. You manually have to decide what happens with literally every input and output with your sensors if you want to get anything done. As one example, say you want to keep your bot between two walls (there is a level like this, at least one, earlier on), which curve on both sides to the end of a course. To successfully navigate such a course, you can put a sensor on both sides of your robot - so they face one wall each, and have logic connected to wheels on both sides that \"turn\" your robot the correct direction whenever you get too \"close\" or too \"far\" from a given wall (so you don't crash into them). This can be done by turning off the motor on the opposite side, or by simply reversing the direction of a motor, or by a combination of things if desired. In this specific case however, you could just have a sensor on one side, and have it try to stay within a \"range\" of distances by turning one way or the other to stay within a certain distance of it. There's almost always a better way to finish a course, but I'm struggling most of the time just to get to the end at all. Yet finding a solution, or finding a better solution, in this game is far more rewarding to me than in most other puzzle-type games I have ever played.I've gotten through about 17 hours of this so far, and most of your time in this game will be spent experimenting with every last thing, repeatedly redesigning a given bot to solve a level properly. You can try to solve a level with the bare minimum, or try to solve it \"better\" by trying to beat a given time or build a bot with less money required. Each stage has multiple of these \"optional\" objectives, which is sure to encourage replayability. I've only completed around 1\/3 of the levels in the game after 17 hours, and I believe myself to be at least relatively intelligent (confirmation bias aside), so there certainly isn't a lack of time to have fun.While the game is very difficult (obviously, this varies by the person), I find it very rewarding to play. When you successfully complete a level in this game, it really feels like you triumped over something meaningful. As someone who has messed around with a fair amount of robotics \"in the real world,\" yet isn't about to go to the level of building my own garage and welding my own circuits again anytime soon, this game is basically the closest thing I've ever found to a good simulator of circuit logic.Keep in mind as well that the game involves circuit logic and a limited number of places to put logic gates, so it can actually be more difficult to solve many of the puzzles than it would be if you were using \"real life\" modern electronics (which often have full software integration, allowing for much more complex commands). This limited nature of the game makes it all the more challenging, and also educational. My poor memory means that I have to be very careful when designing a given circuit that I color-code each wire for given \"segments\" properly, and I'm nearly to the point where I really am going to need to start writing down my circuit logic on paper before trying to put it into action in the game. Yet all of this is great fun, if you're patient. If, on the other hand, you don't have the patience to learn - this game might end up being highly frustrating for you. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants a good challenge, and who ever has had an interest in circuit logic. It isn't for everyone, but it certainly is worth a shot."],["Extremely buggy in core gameplay, do not buy.1) Physics is mostly good but not accurate - it does not compensate for angles (if you tip your robot, the laser ranges and line detectors do not tip), tipping the robot can hit hazard zones even if it is over them, and basically it is 2d pretending to be 3d.2) Occasionally proximity sensors and other sensors do not work at all, even if nothing is blocking it. Plus you can block them with other parts and they can be fine. Had the most trouble here once I hit the second set of stages.3) Badges per map are frustrating, especially the beginning no logic gates - basically the only way to power the motor is with a line detector in the early levels, yet the line detector is super mysterious - if you face your own black paint, it won't work, or at each other, etc .. where the heck are the specs? I expect some realism, not magic.4) Weight distributions do not seem to work right - I placed a TON of stuff to be front heavy, yet the small low powered tires tilted the entire thing no problem. Perhaps I am underestimating the weight or power, yet it does not feel right, if these are metal .. which leads me to ..5) Who the heck powers a motor with a high and low voltage? Does it have a transitor built in and another hidden power supply I don't know about?6) Holy crap do these robots bounce, are they made of rubber?

In this game, the goal is kinda the opposite. you are supposed to create the most half assed bot possible. in order to advance in the game and unlock levels, you are required to gain stars. to gain stars, you need not only beat a level, but beat a level while using the lowest budget or lowest parts possible. I do not like this much at all."],["The limitations of what you can do with logic in this game are too severe, and once you get to the more advanced levels, the problems too complex to solve correctly within those limits. It's not a big deal when you're following a line or solving a maze, but once the puzzle environments get chaotic, winning a given level often involves a fair amount of reliance on luck.Mostly it's that you have very few spaces of logic gates, and even splitting a signal requires that place down a \"gate\" that splits your wire into 2 or 3 connections. You might have a sophisticated solution in mind, but you can't afford the spaces or the gates to implement it. You can't even afford to build a simple set\/reset latch, because that requires 6+ spaces - two ANDS, two NOTs, and two wire splitters. Implementing \"use the smaller of two sensor values\" is usually either not possible or prohibitively expensive in space and part costs.It doesn't help that the game includes random elements and a physics simulation, so what might work one time might fail the next because of minor variations in how the game executes the simulation. Your robot logic is slow, slow, slow compared to actual digital circuits, and a sensor can miss a transition on or off a line as a result.The user interface is quite backward. Wiring gates together is something you're doing constantly, and it's hit or miss. Often I find myself clicking 3-4 times on a pin before it will acknowledge that I want to string a wire, and the difference between \"wire connection started\" and not is very faint visually.It's challenging, but the challenge is entirely in trying to figure out how to make a very simple, limited circuit deal with edge cases, since sophisticated solutions are not possible. After a while I got tired of that limitation."],["TL;DR  LogicBots is a great concept totally let down by bizarre design decisions and quite possibly the worst UI I've ever seen. It can't seem to make up its mind if it wants to be a robotic design simulator or a puzzle game, and winds up losing itself in a no-man's-land between the two, with the fiddly UI of a simulator at odds with the arbitrary restrictions and confinement of a puzzle game.I came into Logicbots expecting something akin to KSP. I envisioned generalized challenges with lots of robot parts and options for different ways to complete the challenges, where my design decisions matter, and I can achieve some cool aesthetics.Instead it's a very confined, railroady kind of puzzle game, where each puzzle has only a handful of solutions. The process of iterating designs to find that solution might have been fun... but an incredibly frustrating and fiddly UI totally lets it down.Just for context, I'm not just talking out my rear here. I've done this in real life. In college, I designed and built an autonomous robot that could navigate a maze, \"mine\" marble and BB \"ore\", sort the ore to separate it, and deposit it in separate bins at the end of the maze. It included elevation changes, wall following, and line following. Did we use individual gate chips? NO! We used a freaking computerized robot controler. Twenty years ago! This is not new tech. I can't see anybody actually bothering, in today's electronics landscape, wiring AND gates together on a perforated circuit board.Just a few examples...~ Most parts are placed symmetrically on either side of the robot. Why then, did they not include a symmetry mode for part placement? Yes, I realize you can create snap lines. That's a lot of extra steps and extra clicks to do something that could have been done much more elegantly with a mirror symmetry placement mode.~ Connecting circuit boards requires either extremely and irritatingly precise clicks on a few pixels, when zoomed out enough to see the big picture, or many wheel scrubs to zoom in and out. If you misclick, which you will do a lot, enormous UI elements come onto the screen, often blocking what you're trying to click. Larger pins or even a right-click context menu system would be much better. A key binding to go into wiring mode would be better.~ When editing numbers in certain circuits, the game zooms all the way in for you, \"helpfully\". I'm sure this *seemed* like a good idea. It wasn't. If you can even begin to click on the tiny little connections to wire circuits, you can just as easily read the numbers you're typing. I don't need them blown up to be a 200-point font. And I definitely don't need the many scroll actions required to zoom back out to work on everything else.~ Keybinding cannot be edited. Not even manually through a config file. It's hard-coded into the game. Some people may not care. I care a lot. I don't use wasd. I use esdf. Because it's superior in every concievable way. Feel free to disagree, but I should still be able to rebind keys in my game.~ Reference information for things like what effect a certain logic gate has should be easy to find, preferably on the screen in a non-disruptive manner whenever the part is highlighted. This could be done with a tool-tip on mouse-over quite easily. It could simply be included in the frankly unnecessarily ginormous UI that pops up when the part is selected. Nope, instead you have to click an icon to open it up, every single time, which covers up most of the screen so that, rather than reasoning through your circuit with enough information, you have to choose: information or circuit visibility.~ This scenario happens all the time. I pick out a part to put on the robot. I realize I needed a certain type of symmetry. Can I drop the part in empty space conveniently to pick up later, so I can add snap lines? Nope. Can I just hold the part in my cursor while I use other UI elements to at least turn on snap lines I've previously created? No again. I have to undo everything about the part selection, or I have to put it on the robot somewhere else (which is ridiculous in terms of immersion and realism... \"Let me solder this sensor onto some random part of the robot's body... then I can pick up my ruler to measure out where I wanted it in the first place... now I can de-solder it and move it to where it should have been.\" Ridiculous.) This may sound like a minor gripe, but it happens over and over and over, with the annoyance building up each time.Other design decisions are just as bizarre:~ Parts are arbitrarily and artificially restricted on each level. Why? Have they not invented the NAND gate yet? Really? That's odd since I can access mathematical logic, which very likely has NAND gates inside of it. Player choice is never a bad thing. Let me choose from *any* logic gate.~ For that matter, why are we using physical logic gates at all? This seems like a choice more about reliving some childhood nostalgia than a real decision about how modern robot building works. In the real world today, I don't see why anyone would bother with individual AND and NOT gates when small computerized controllers like Arduinos are so cheap and readily available. Just googling now, I can buy an entire computerized controller for less than some single gates cost in this game. Did the developer just not bother to check that? I think a much more fun game concept, and a much more useful life-skill to teach would be to *program* the robot, rather than *wire* it from gate to gate. Why go with the wiring? Well because it's more like a puzzle, obviously. That kind of arbitrary game design is just... unfortunate.~ Why do chassis include motors that can magically send output anywhere? Why do they only run at a single specific RPM? Why not let the player build *inside* the chassis? A trade-off between lightweight and simple versus putting in more battery power to supply more voltage to more powerful motors sounds a lot more interesting and engaging to me. Well, I'll tell you why. The puzzle. It always comes back to this game wanting desperately to be a -puzzle- instead of a simulation of real robot building. If you could vary the voltage sent to a motor, how could they make you choose between specific chassis on a simplistic comparison of cost vs. RPM? It would almost be like you could use whatever chassis appeals to you visually, and then solve the level in your own way... and we can't have that. You must do the level *their* way. The puzzle's way. Silly human with your desire for *choice* and *creativity*.~ Why are prices so absurd and arbitrary? 5 for a special signal splitter board? IRL I could do that with two bits of wire for probably less than a penny. 10 for a single AND gate? Survey says: A 74x08 chip with *four* AND gates on it costs $0.53. And again, the hundred-odd pounds of logic in many robots in the game could easily be replaced by a 20 Arduino that has infinitely more interesting and fun possibilities for design and gameplay.Imagine: instead of building a simple logic-gate-based robot that can barely manage to follow a line in a jittery way, you *could* do that with an Arduino-based robot design with the same simple logic, as the \"beginner\" robot. But a more advanced design might include multiple sensors to detect how *quickly* you're crossing the line, allowing you to write code to adjust the *voltage* to each motor for smooth curves, to complete the level with speed and style, via more advanced coding and design. That sounds like a fun game, where my decisions matter, and my skills actually help.

The tech side of this game is awesome and it has a whole lot of potential.  That being said, it wasn't the game that I wanted it to be when I bought it.  When I was young I played a game called Robot Metropolis.  There was a storyline and you gained bots as you moved through the story.  You used the robots to move the story along by programming them to do certain tasks. For example, retrieve a key from somewhere the main character couldn't reach.  That was the game I wanted.  Instead I got the more technical side.  The tutorials and quizzes, while informative and fulfilling were a little dry. For the tech geek wanting to learn about robots it was solid, but I wanted an adventure that taught me something.
