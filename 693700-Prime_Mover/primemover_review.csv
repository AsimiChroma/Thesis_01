0,2701,This is a game just for those STEM kids who could beat math blasters when they were 3. Initially I was on board for the tutorial but it becomes @$z ramming hard almost immediately. Each puzzle feels like an end stage boss where they forgot to put the warm up levels in between. A smooth brain like me would have preferred a medium or easy mode which has more of an educational progression to logic and programming puzzles. I Guess I'll go back to games like Fire N Ice for the NES.
1,2686,"As someone who enjoys coding, I like this game. The problems thrown at you can be very demanding, but in the end it always feels rewarding to see a working flow.100% completion basically boils down to solving every normal problem. Especially the last few of them are really challenging, however, guides can provide some support in that regard. There is a hard version for almost every problem, but that mode is completely optional."
2,2679,"This is such a great engineering puzzle game!I spend a week on the final puzzle and enjoyed it from the begining to the end.It gives you such small building blocks, but you can use them to calculate pretty much everything (since the game is Turing-complete)The game gives you unlimited amount of nested integrated circuits that have inputs and outputs and that means you can make a ""higher-level"" elements that perform complex operations using the base elements.Want to add 2 numbers? Make a circuitWant to make a memory cell? Make a curcuit! Want to make a calculator? Use your ""add"" circuit and make another curcuit :D Really hope that 4Bit Games would continue making games like this. If you're working on something, please let us know. Can't wait to see what you come up with next"
3,2677,"First: this DOES work on MacOS Catalina. There's a big warning on the Steam page that says otherwise, bit it loads and runs just fine.I play this on a macbook and no mouse, so some of the interactions are awkward, but workarounds exist: - ""Left"" mouse button is a single-finger click on the trackpad- ""Right"" mouse button is a double-finger click on the trackpad- ""Middle"" mouse button is Option+Click on the trackpadOther than that, I have had no issues and am enjoying this game a lot."
4,2668,"Fun game if you like chill puzzles. I don't happen to like the way timing works, you just have to guess at it. There is no event order, other than this, great game."
5,2665,"An interesting programming game. The most interesting part of the game is the integrated circuits - which allow you to get around the very limited room available - giving you extra space. And, since you can nest your circuits - you really have a lot of room - but managing it - keeping track of it all - can be quite a challenge.The game badly needs some quality of life upgrades - I have played many programming games and seldom used any internal note taking/comment line support, but wow I really wanted it here. It also begs for a compendium where you keep your integrated circuits so you don't have to recreate them from scratch or scrounge through your inscrutable uncommented previous codes. There is a real opportunity here for a future version - finishing the game with a personal collection of tools that you can throw at bigger and bigger problems would feel great. Here - you can't even rotate a circuit (as far as I could tell) so I had to recreate it just to transpose it or rotate it. At least you can choose a few different colors for your circuits. One useful tool for me, in lieu of comments - was making all my circuits that are present just for timing the same color. Anyway - if you like programming games and have patience for this sort of limitation - this is a great game."
6,2664,"Interesting constraints on a lot of challenging problemsDesigned in a very visceral tactile kinda way, and the game just oozes style and atmosphere.  Really did not expect the level of lore / atmosphere the game delivered on"
7,2661,"Excellent puzzle game with outstanding complexity.Tools for solutions are complete garbage at first look, but they can be used in many unexpected ways, and therefore they are sufficient.Be mindful that the game is HARD. Probably one of the hardest puzzles on Steam.You may like it or hate it, but it is not yet another kindergarten level puzzle like Human Resource Machine or Shenzhen IO."
8,2661,"This is a negative review, because it does not work on macOS. The middle mouse button does not work, and it can not be reassigned."
9,2661,Tough puzzles but very rewarding and up my alley. I think it is a nice puzzle game for the winter sale price.
10,2660,"Great for seasoned programmers and for dabblers. You might not make it to the end, but the building and satisfaction when you build your own CPU is pretty nice.Unlike other programming games, you don't actually write code, and the basic building blocks aren't the obvious/boring ones in an EE/CS background. They're deceptive but fun nevertheless.Really appreciate how it reinforces hardware design and trade-offs between size and cost and speed. You can build a solution in a bare number of parts for cheap, but it's slow. Throw more transistors at the problem, and process in parallel and watch performance sky rocket. Or how generalized solutions might support all possible inputs, but tailoring sightly to the inputs can save significant components and time. I loved having to tweak wire lengths to make sure multiple units/inputs processed in the same time (just like real hardware signals propagate and commit in chips). Or the fact the ICs are limited to just 4 wires and you spend so much time debating how to reduce or multiplex your signals like so many damn chips out there. Or having to route wires in limited 2D space like real PCBs.You might not see these relationships with real world hardware design due to the funny components, but there are direct parallels all over the place. A good teaching tool.The graphics and audio were quite pleasing too.My biggest gripe is lack of copy and paste between puzzles. Considering the game design of using previous solutions as building blocks in later puzzles, having to replicate the blocks by hand is a huge pita. Like the memory blocks."
11,2660,"Fantastic art and gameplay and soundtrack.My only dislike is the sprite for the toggle wire.When I clicked on stuff around the board and the tentacles and hands and weird orbs reacted, it was such a fun moment. The flashbacks are slick, the animation really works for me.As of this writing I am trying to solve Reverse! These are getting harder :D, but I am enjoying experimenting. It would be cool if I could save designs in a little notebook, and then I could pull them out as sub-chips in any level, but I guess that is what graph paper is for!10/10 great work"
12,2659,"This game will put your brain on fire, if you like that type of game buy it as soon as possible."
13,2659,"make circuits, get headaches"
14,2658,Lots of fun. Well paced. Gets challenging despite seeming simplicity. Cool art/music.
15,2656,"Game seems good, just can't get over the fact that the component selection changes when you hover over an already placed component... makes component placement very finicky and irritating. Will come back to it in a while and see if the developers changed it.PS: Running the game on Linux Mint. Had to change launch options to `LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/libcurl.so.4 %command%` to get it to run and the sound also doesn't work.UPDATE: Runs fine when I use Proton... so it's just broken using the normal Linux Runtime"
16,2654,"Dear traveller, if the phrase ""Zach-like"" means nothing to you then TURN BACK NOW! However, if you are familiar and are looking for another Zach-like to add to your collection then this might be a good one, especially if you like a challenge. But traveller beware. Know what you are getting into. This game has a handful of tutorial missions and then it will hit you with the mother of difficulty spikes.The reason for this is that unlike many Zach-like games which give you logical components that you wire together in order to achieve different activities or behaviours, in this game the components you are given are a lot more limited and the solutions to the problems involve not just using, but almost abusing these components in ways you are not told about, as well as making copious use of things like race conditions in order to wrestle the required behaviour out of your meagre building blocks.So, dear traveller, the road ahead is not for everyone, many people might find this a little bit on the sadistic side. But if you are looking for a challenge and you have the patience then there is a lot of satisfaction to be gained from working your way up the solution graphs."
17,2653,"Excellent zach-like game that teaches you some programming principles. Like wrapping your head around logic-based puzzles? Then this is for you. No hand-holding though, many players complain about a steep learning curve.It's especially rewarding if you refine your complex and messy solution into something elegant."
18,2649,>Review<A fantastic Zachtronics-style programming puzzler.>Rating< Trash Kind of Crap Not For Me Acceptable Fantastic Hall of Fame
19,2645,"I wanted to like this and initially I did, but it's just too lores, and too primitive compared to a Zachtronics game.   Basically, I felt I was fighting the UI and not solving the problem most of the time.I don't want to have to draw a complicated loop just to repeatedly add one to a number, and have to move everything if I'm too close to the edge of the grid just because the grid is too small for how primitive the operations are."
20,2645,"Prime Mover is very much in the style of Zachtronics games such as Space Chem and Exapunks, and delivers optimization/programming puzzles that are about as deep as those in the best Zachtronics games, with a similar (somewhat imperfect) level of quality of life features and surrounding background visuals and audio (enough to feel like a game). So, the short version is, if you enjoyed or loved Zach's optimization games, you'll very likely find many hours of enjoyable tinkering time in Prime Mover, as well.Prime Mover actually avoids one QoL pitfall that some of Zach's games fell into. Once you finish the very straight-forward tutorial, which just teaches what each component does, all components are unlocked for all of the real puzzles. You will not have to play through half the game or more with a partial tool set to unlock everything before you can revisit all the early levels to get down to real optimization. On the not-so-great side, you'll wish the cut-and-paste option were less quirky and more powerful later in the game - mirroring as well as rotation would be a simple addition, and I really wish I could save an annotated book of ""chips"" and attach comments to my puzzle solution save slots. These issues don't rise to the level of major frustration, but could have avoided some tedious rebuilding. The class of puzzles it gives you is original - not a knock off of any other puzzle game I've played. They require clear thought to solve, with later puzzles ramping in difficulty significantly, and, beyond that, many leave a lot of room to develop better strategies to optimize if you, like me, like to compete with the (Zach-like) histograms. Some of those histograms will leave you scratching your head wondering what you are missing until you have some critical insight - and I say this as a veteran Zachtronics player and high performance computer programmer by trade. In addition, nearly every puzzle has an advanced ""bugged"" version that forces you to resolve it without the use of some convenient component or with tight space constraints, a few of which will truly test your abilities to even solve at all.For me, this difficulty level is a good thing. I can come back now and then and throw hours at a puzzle or optimization level that stumped me, and get a whole lot of hours of tinkering fun for a very reasonable price. I'll caution, however, that this game has maybe a dozen more ""casual"" level puzzles before it ramps up, so if you don't enjoy spending hours wracking your head and trying out and discarding experiments to find your way to a solution, you might run out of steam well before you reach the difficult puzzles. Just look at the completion percentages on the game's last few achievements."
21,2643,"I like to learn something from a game time to time and as a fan of Zachtronic games i tried this one without expecting too much.Tiis is an over simplified algorithmic game; i hate how they manage some stuffs but it's cool overall.This is Casual players with simple input to output, not a complex puzzle.I kinda hate it and i knew i would hate it but at least i give it a try.I like when the designer give the opportunity to be smart sometimes and have a same result with optimisation they never thought about it but here everything look arbitrary like the holes to make you scare or trying to make you less efficient, it's just a bad habit for a puzzle, also a little bit boring and no difficulty, you don't have a lot of room for imagination.Also beware this is not a ""simulation/programming+puzzle"" look the tags.I'll stay with Shenzhen IO and 2Dboys game 7billion Humans for now, but you may like Prime mover.I wanted to put a negative recommandation but even if my preference are different from what offer the game and even if i found this boring; i'll say it's good and the art is cool... try it at least."
22,2643,Fun and challenging puzzles.
23,2643,"The game starts out innocently enough, holding your hand with a few basic tutorial levels for each building block, before quickly throwing you head first into the deep end, asking you to do things that seem impossible with what little you have. You need to figure out timing issues and subtle interactions between pieces as you slowly tinker yourself into an ugly, working solution.But, of course, that's the appeal of these kinds of open ended zachlike programming games isn't it? So if your a hardcore fan of the genre, this should be a no-brainer addition to your collection. The appealing pixel art and the unique infinitely recursive board mechanic are just extra plus points."
24,2642,"Great programming gameits a challenging, from what i have seen it feels like more difficult than zach's gamebut the chips inside chips really open up endless probability. the first level after the tutorial, i used 287 chips and many ppl used 0...."
25,2642,"A very much like ""programming"" or so to say Zach-like games. And it looks quite prominent, but user interface is so bad that it is leterally unplayable:- you can't move elements- to copy-paste you need a ""special"" component.- undo/redo keys are meant ONCE in one of the earlier scenarios and if you happen to forget - bad for you- there's no ability to save templates for future useHowever I like visual design and overall puzzle design if you manage to overcome UI, music is quite medioce though."
26,2641,"A Zach-like but not by Zachtronics. In each puzzle your goal is to design a circuit board.You have numbers to be processed coming from inputs and based on them certain numbers need to be sent to outputs according to the logic given in the puzzle. In this the game somewhat resembles TIS-100 but has a different and somewhat simpler model. In TIS-100 you have to write commands to process numbers. In Prime Mover you just lay out a board with wires and components and the numbers travel along them automatically. Numbers can be sent to different directions based on the numbers sign or with the direction changing whenever a number travels over a certain spot; they can be duplicated, deleted, incremented, or decremented. That's about it.Somehow, when I got to the real puzzles after the introductory ones, I felt that designing solutions was for some reason much more annoying than in TIS-100, at least for me. Maybe that'll change if I get better at this game. Despite the mild annoyance I'm giving a positive review because I think there's a good chance that many Zachtronics fans will like this game as well even though for me it wasn't as enjoyable as TIS-100 or Shezhen I/O.Just like Zachtronics games you can see histograms showing how efficient players' solutions tend to be. Unlike in Zachtronics games the solution isn't graded based on 3 measurements but only 2: the number of cycles take & the number of components."
27,2636,"Very zachtronics like game but with a more interesting dressing than usual. Design wise I feel like the puzzles are straight out of some hardware arch book, but the tools are limited enough that it's interesting, and it's quite forgiving as you can use the fact that chips can be embedded on chips (and so on) so effectively you have unlimited space.All in all a decent game, doesn't offer anything special and could have done with more carefully crafted puzzles (and a better progression), but goes beyond the threshold where a problem solver kinda person would be motivated to finish it eventually."
28,2635,"I'm a sucker for games like this ever since TIS-100. I shouldn't be since it veers close to my day job, and who wants to get home from work and... do more work? Still, there's something about shaving a handful of ticks off a solution, or using a bit less hardware, that makes me smile.8/10, would have been 9 if it had an undo stack, and I kept 1 point to add if the rest of the game is as good as it's been so far."
29,2634,"I am a board Computer Science teacher with the summer off exploring games marketed at teaching, exploring and using CS skills.This is a fun game that uses circuit board concepts to solve problems and puzzles. It is low cost and approachable to beginners. It includes an array of EE concepts from basic switches to more involved topics like integrated circuits and logic gates. I think it is a great way to visualize some of the theories behind circuit boards and Electrical Engineering. The font choice was not the best, making some things difficult to read, but it fits the 80's computer game motif and style. This is worth a try if you're curious about circuit boards or are interested in that type of puzzle game."
30,2634,"Oh this is EXACTLY what I needed after being a little disappointed by a certain other companies decision to release a graphic novel.  10/10, itch scratchedgreat gamewell done"
31,2633,"Recommend  6/10ProsThis games 8-bit-ish, old school look and sound captured my attention.  With very little help, you must figure out how to use the pieces you are given to solve logic puzzles.  Theoretically, everything you need is available, since the game eventually gives you access to a nested circuit piece allowing you to grow the board space.  The first several puzzles had me hooked and there are even challenge versions for each puzzle.ConsI was surprised at how complicated each puzzle became as I progressed through the game.  I felt like there needed to be some more advanced pieces to save time in the end game.  I found myself spending hours, sometimes days, working on a puzzle.  I couldnt find a way to copy previously designed circuits from one puzzle to another, so I would redesign circuit logic again and again.  Eventually I found myself drawing schematics to keep around, helping me remember what Id already figured out.  It actually started feeling like real stressful work instead of something to relax with.  Also, I would have liked to see a better presentation of the nested circuits.  I started to lose track of what each nested piece did as I dug in and out.OverallI would recommend this game to anyone that wants to challenge themselves to program in this games unique method and prove their own programming skills.  In the end, I did not have enough time to spend on this game in order to finish it.  Maybe its just me, but I would call this a niche market game in which you need to have time and be dedicated to complete it."
32,2631,"HARD GAME,be careful, only for    PRO GAMERS (Level God),LOGIC FULLMake Circuits from nothing!!!!!!!"
33,2631,I like it
34,2627,"This was much more hardcore than the aesthetics lead me to believe. It tickles the programmer fancy of building low-level systems. In fact, this game slowly builds up to the point where you are building a full-blown processor.If you are into Zach-likes, and you are on the fence about this one, like I was, then don't be fooled by the simple looks. This is stone-cold logic in practice. It is very much about building flipflops, S/R latches, transistors, etc.The music, aesthetic and overall atmosphere are a great bonus. The only downside is the fiddly controls."
35,2625,"Pro: The puzzles are really good, and this title can stand tall in the company of other Zach-like puzzlers. The aesthetic is pretty neat too.Con: The lack of some quality of life features like a snippet storage for saving already assembled is really damn painful and can make solving the more complex puzzles a pain. A feature like this could allow for even more complex puzzles to be thrust on the player which would be awesome."
36,2620,Amazing! I find myself thinking of the puzzles while working ^^
37,2620,"The idea is good, the interface is bad."
38,2620,can't leave comments so i have no idea how my solutions work 10/10
39,2620,"You're basically an alien designing circuit boards, the puzzles quickly got pretty challenging. Recommended if you're into logic puzzles"
40,2619,SUPER
41,2612,Hardest game on Steam. Some of the later missions are so tough there are literally forum topics regarding how it hadn't been solved yet. I got about 75% through and stopped. Buck wild if you understand it
42,2609,"Lacks polish in a few places (e.g. selecting orientation of two-output blocks could be made more intuitive), and, sadly, several technical problems on Linux remain not addressed by the developers (though issues are in part fault of GameMaker:Studio)."
43,2607,Makes me feel stupid.
44,2606,"One of the better and more challenging puzzle games on steam that pushes your creativity with simple tools, creating things you never thought possible."
45,2602,"An elegantly simple puzzle game inspired by hardware and low-level programming logic. Will definitely scratch the logic + logistics itch. The first couple of level-selections are purely tutorial and might throw you off at first because they basically solve themselves.Nearly all puzzles feature a ""glitched"" version that imposes crucial restrictions that can be both maddening and hugely satisfying when you finally solve them.Overall, I recommend this game for programmers who enjoy being forced to use primitive operations to achieve complex behavior. You'll look at ""x + y"" in a different light if you've never messed with this kind of stuff before."
46,2601,"Great  game. The visuals, style, music and sci-fi setting are superb, which make this game quite pleasant to play often unlike other games of this same programming genre."
47,2600,If you enjoy this type of game and also bashing your head into things then this is the game for you. Seriously difficult but ultimately rewarding.
48,2597,a dope and incredibly hard zachlike
49,2595,"This is a challenging but fun ""Zach-like"" open-ended puzzle game. The basic gameplay is standard for the genre: you place components on a grid to manipulate inputs to produce desired outputs. The inputs/outputs are numbers, and the game has a circuitry theme (but note that unlike MHRD and Silicon Zeroes, there is no pedagogical relationship to actual circuits).The main innovation is infinitely nestable sub-boards. The effect of this innovation is that problems of essentially any complexity can be solved through top-down design and modular decomposition. In turn, the levels have a very wide range of difficulty, ramping up to ""very hard"".What you get:13 tutorial levels21 regular levels20 challenge levels - one harder variant of each regular level except the final(Note that the ""challenge levels"" are called ""bugged"" levels in-game, but I don't want to call them that in a review.)ProsSome of the harder levels are exceptionally open-endedProvides a large amount of playable time if you can deal with the harder levels and/or optimize solutions.Due to nestable sub-boards, you mostly won't find yourself in a situation where you know how to solve a level but can't fit the components. (There are some challenge levels that intentionally disable sub-boards.) However, you may have wire-routing difficulties if you don't plan top-down, because sub-boards have limited in/out wires.Coherent set of components.Coherent level progression (many levels building on earlier levels)Polished art and theme (within the 8-bit aesthetic)ConsNo sandboxThe game may be too difficult for some people. This is tricky for me to evaluate, since it wasn't for me. It felt to me like the 21 regular levels split 7/6/4/4 between easy/medium/hard/very hard.Efficiency mostly doesn't matter for solving a level (just for stats), but there is a hard limit on how long a solution can run. The limit is very high, and I only hit it once, but it came as a total surprise, and violates the design of this game that you can solve anything by modularizing, at least until you optimize.Minor IssuesYou can see full inputs of each level in advance, but if you want to look through them all the UI is annoying. Fortunately, you rarely need to look at the full inputs to decide on your approach, but a few times you do. This could have been solved by stating input constraints for some levels more carefully -- there's screen room to expand the level description area. Fortunately, for the final level someone posted a Steam guide without spoilers that starts off with the full inputs for the level in easily readable text form.The leaderboards seem wrong for some harder levels, with a huge spike of impossibly good solutions. Because fixed inputs are used, I suspect some players hard-coded their solutions to generate the tested output rather than perform the task described.(The point about input constraints isn't hugely important, but just to elaborate in case the developer reads: Some challenge levels are made difficult by disabling one or more components in a regular level. Other challenge levels provide the full toolbox but have more difficult inputs than the regular level. In four of these cases, the level descriptions are the same. For example, the regular Maximum has only positive inputs and the challenge Maximum has positive and negative inputs, but the only way to see this difference is to scroll through the inputs. In contrast, the regular Multiplicator description says that inputs are positive, but the challenge Multiplicator description deletes that line. I would also have stated a limit on the list length for levels like Reverse, Sort, and Mode, and the range of possible memory indices for Processor.)"
50,2595,"The first levels are quite easy and there's roughly one level of decently challenging puzzles. Then the puzzles rapidly become tedious and very difficult to solve with any elegant solutions. Which could be fine (if a bit uninteresting) but the logic pieces are kind of broken and hard to work with, meaning you have to spend more time trying to place and route (connect everything together) rather than actually solving a puzzle. It seems like the ""recursive"" boards are a way to get around this, but I think it more highlights a problem with the puzzles then serve as good design.As an example I though the puzzle where you flip a sequence (the first time) was pretty neat. On the topic of nice things I also thought that the pretty much instant start up was really good as well!I'm usually a big fan of ""Zachtronic-style"" games, and in many ways this game has made me appreciate how hard it apparently is to make good puzzles for them. The overall style of this game is nice, even if it could be useful slightly higher resolution to make it easier to distinguish the different gates easier. But solving these puzzles with actual programming or logic gates is significantly easier, which kind of just seems wrong to me."
51,2594,"disclaimer: have only played a part of the game, about 40%.my initial impression is the following:- fun for any puzzle fan for the first challenges only.- after a little while things do start to get quite abstract but you can pick the challenges you complete.- without the right skills it might get way too frustrating for the later levels.- if you enjoy deeper asbtract logic (most programmers would for example), this game is a lot of fun!TLDR: love deeper abstract logic puzzles? go for it!"
52,2583,"I didn't expect this game to be as good as it was, but the graphics are very well polished, the puzzles are really challenging, the components force you to use some ingenuity, and you can do some really neat things with the tools provided. If it had a level editor it would be perfect, but I can forgive that because you can put ICs inside of other ICs."
53,2582,A really fun but very hard 'Zach-like'. I don't really like some of the artificial constraints of some of the components but you learn to work around them and it is always satisfying to beat a level.
54,2582,This game is pretty good.
55,2582,this game is not suitable for individuals possessing the following items:[x] - a life
56,2582,"This is a great little game about circuit design. It's close enough to real circuits that it feels very satisfying to complete, but still simple enough to play that almost anyone could pick it up. The mechanics have enough quirks that it doesn't just feel like taking a coding tutorial. Lots of fun for people of all skill levels."
57,2582,"A very competent Zack-like game, with some wonderful old-school puzzles, and a good difficulty curve. Recommended!"
58,2578,"Aesthetic is crisp, gameplay is crisp, audio is beautiful. This is the most polish you can get for $15."
59,2577,"This is just brain (the programming language) in 2D. If you like answering questions like ""how do you multiply in brain?"" or ""how do you sort in brain?"" then this is exactly for you. For a non-programmer this is a big task with high difficulty (maybe impossible if you're not mathematically talented); for a life-long programmer, this is drudge work. I judge Zachlikes on what they can offer beyond a constrained and hostile programming environment. In that respect this one ranks near the bottom. And some of the constraints are just downright perplexing. Why are there chips, that can arbitrarily extend the area used and provide modularity, but no way to reuse chips beyond clunkily going back to the last one you used and copy/pasting? Why can numbers go both directions on wires (indeed sometimes have to, when using a sorter on numbers that can be any sign), but there are no components that can act differently depending on direction of flow across them, or any way to exploit number collisions? There's just so little room for building on what you have done before, or exploring emergent complexity.The game is cheap, and I bought it on sale on top, but even so, I do not feel I got enough game for the money."
60,2577,"If you enjoy programming games, this should be right up your alley. Where this one differs is it's more of a hardware programming (vs software programming) game.To explain; values flow through your design continuously, as opposed to being explicitly picked up and taken through a process. As such, you need to worry about controlling the flow of data with locks, so your processing of the current data doesn't get contaminated. It's a small change from its spiritual predecessors, but makes for a decidedly different type of puzzle from the Zachtronics games you've played before.There's a nesting board component you can use, which eases the difficulty of some of the earlier puzzles (don't need to reroute everything if you run out of space). Later puzzles rely on it, and so you have less flexibility. The puzzles in general are for the most part well thought out (with the exception of a reorder one, whose description doesn't make any sense relative to the expected output--but you can skip puzzles, so no biggie)The one issue I have with the game is related to the icons for selecting components. These icons are miniaturized versions of the actual components, but due to the chunky retro art style they end up looking quite different, to the point where I often confused the -/0/+ sorter with the adder/subtractor, and I'd often hunt for the lock icon because it looked more like a square than a lock. I've finally trained myself to interpret the toadstool as an arrow, but that took some time too. I understand what the designer was going for with the stylized graphics, but usability suffers considerably as a result. On a related note, copy/paste is a pain to clean up after, and I'm constantly setting breakpoints by accident, but----Look, on the whole, it's a hard Play This Game from me. Even with everything I've said above, I highly recommend it.At time of this review, it looks like only a few have solved some of the later puzzles, which is a real shame. They're really interesting head-scratchers.. but a lot of fun once you dive into them."
61,2577,"Prime Mover is a great challenge, and the atmosphere of the game makes solving a problem an enjoyable experience. The beautiful soundtrack fits well with the mysterious setting and the art is very appealing."
62,2573,"This game is AMAZING. But extremely difficult if you didn't go to school for hardware engineering. I've found programming skills don't help a lot here. Awesome job by the devs here for a challenge, seriously."
63,2570,"Prime Mover is a deceptive game. Despite the charming and simple graphics style, or even the initially simple mechanics, this is a devilishly hard game. This is part of the 'Zachlike' genre of puzzle games: freeform puzzles based on constructing machines to turn inputs into outputs. Your tools here are simpler than any other in this genre, yet from this you construct elaborate and complicated machines whose functions may at first seem impossible to reproduce. This outward simplicity is its initial appeal, but also its greatest weakness. Something that may have taken a few lines of code in a Zachtronics game is now much more laborious to construct, but that brings with it its own rewards. After completing a long, arduous puzzle brick by brick, you can look back and watch as your machine comes to life, remembering all the toil that went into its design. A sample puzzle sees random numbers come in from one side of an 8 by 8 board, and by using simple pieces (adding or subtracting by 1, testing if positive or negative, and triggers that freeze and unfreeze a number) you can eventually do multiplication, test for prime numbers, and even build a processor. The key is to use an ability to 'nest' your solution inside another circuit. So, that 8x8 board can really contain hundreds of circuits and thousands of pieces. But very few players will ever reach that far. Having beaten every Zachtronics game, I can safely say that this one is the second hardest out of all of them. The final levels, for example, have less than a dozen or even half dozen people beating them. Fewer, perhaps, when solutions that don't survive a random test aren't counted. There isn't a difficulty ramp here, it's more of a cliff. There's very little time after the tutorial before the puzzles get really hard. So, I can only recommend this game to dedicated players. I suspect that the vast majority of people will stop playing before they even see half of the puzzles available.  But, judging from my hours played, you can tell that there's something compelling, if maddening, about its systems."
64,2568,"It seems like a fun game, similar to the Zachtronics games. However, a technical issue that causes click inputs to not register holds me back from recommending it."
65,2566,"Game concept is pretty good, close to Spacechem. Unfortunately controls are so terrible that is becomes unplayable.* Can't easily move parts of circuit. (you can copy, but that's not enough)* Can't slow down after speeding up* Doesn't have an in-circuit ""pause"" button like Spacechem, so debugging becomes very hardThe 8 bit graphics thing seems nice at first but mostly just makes the UI hard to read.All in all, I would recommend waiting for some improvement, then maybe giving this game another shot. It really has potential, but it's just not there right now."
66,2561,"Quite a challenging game as a puzzle with my limited tools, wire space, and brain cells,"
67,2557,"Really fun and challenging programming puzzle game.  My hours are an understatement; I would often write down the current puzzle on which I was stuck to work on during other parts of the day.  Some of the songs are absolute jams; I wish it had a more robust tracklist.  I got about 2/3 of the way through before I had to tap out (just not creative or clever enough).  Was well worth my time, and at some point I hope to come back and conquer the rest!"
68,2555,"Rating: 6/10Create and optimize solutions like in Zachtronics games.The first levels which serve as a tutorial are too easy and could use at least some optimization options to make them more interesting.After the introduction levels the game becomes extremely difficult very fast. So I was only able to solve a few regular puzzles after passing the introduction levels.The art style is nice but the symbols are a bit too blocky for my taste andthe user interface is also a bit unintuitive.So I recommend this game, but only to hard core puzzle solvers."
69,2555,Can not recommend it. If you solve the first few puzzles it seems quite delightful. Presentation and artwork look really good. But then comes the annoying later levels. The main problem is: they are not hard. The only thing that's hard about them is that the tools you are getting suck. You have to manuel SYNCHRONIZE your input. The actual problem is solved with 1 or 2 chips but then you have to add like 5 to 6 more locks just so that the results come in the right order. And then you have to deal with expremly limited pathing of your wire. The worst thing is the (+ 0 -) decider. It sorts your stuff into positive negative and zero. BUT it only has 3 connections. Which means you have to SEND ONE BACK the way it came from if you need all 3 at the same time. And if numbers collide the program is failed. Buy Opus Magnum instead. Waaaaay better game.
70,2553,"If you love games like Spacechem or Opus Magnum in which you have to create repeating circuits, this may be the game for you.It personally was not teh game for me. I seem to get this boost of confidence that I know what I'm doing, and that it's just a simple puzzle game, but it is anything but.Prepare to be challenged to a new level. I would count this game more difficult than Spacechem or Opus Magnum becase of the layer of number management.This game is like Human Resource Machine and Spacechem combined, and if you are up to the challege, feel free to give it a go.8/10 (-3 oh boy am I dumb)"
71,2551,"Wow this game is hard. Excellent little cutscenes and art style. I think the game should do a better job transitioning from the green, explanatory stages to some of the advanced concepts used in the later levels."
72,2551,"Prime Mover lulls you into a false sense of security. As you knock off the first 10 or so puzzles in about 15 minutes flat it might not feel like a very complex game, but it's only then that the steady difficulty curve turns each task into a series of mountain peaks.But, that's not a bad thing. From the moment the game opens up you'll have access to all of the tools needed to complete the rest. You can make extremely complicated contraptions by building up from the base parts; and the integrated circuit allows you to infinitely place grids inside grids - you're not gonna run out of space. There's even a challenge mode for the majority of puzzles that add a new spin to the problem, such as disallowing specific modules, dealing with negative inputs, or even putting one of your key parts in a really awkward place.You know you're in for a ride when the last level combines everything you've learned to make a mini-processor."
73,2551,"Excellent Zachtronics-like puzzle game! Bonus points for infinite nested recursion possibilities.A little awkward interface though, and test cases should be randomized to avoid hard coded solutions.And from a Norwegian developer, congratulations! :)"
74,2550,Very challenging but highly polished and a lot of fun. Totally worth it if you enjoy puzzles
75,2549,"Extremely difficult just because the tools you have absolutely suck for the puzzles involved.  Things get really awkward really quickly, due to inconsistent behavior from triggering various things or by simply not having enough control over routing.  The difficulty raises SHARPLY after the tutorial and spikes a couple more times after that, though sometimes you use solutions from previous puzzles to solve later ones.  Like, a puzzle about adding inputs (extremely difficult with the tools available) necessitates a solution that can be used in another puzzle about multiplying inputs.Later you have to sort inputs with mechanics that present no apparent way to store or retrieve information, and then for the final puzzle you get to interpret commands and compute data.  This would be absolutely impossible if it weren't for the ability to create what are essentially mini-circuitboards which you can place inside eachother.  This effectively negates the playing area restriction, which only serves to allow puzzles that ask unreasonable things of you.Maybe if you're the type of person that enjoys making complicated circuits out of redstone you'd enjoy working with this toolset.  I sure don't.The plot is presented via occasional cutscenes but the text-based narration in these cutscenes is encrypted.  It's a simple cipher but it's totally unnecessary and seems to be a heavy-handed attempt at having a ""mysterious"" or ""obscure"" plot.  In reality, the plotline is extremely simple and seems to be more of a backstory for a different game that isn't even out yet."
76,2549,It pains me to have to give this a negative vote even though it's an original game with an excellent concept and mind bending puzzles. The sole reason for the negative vote is the UI - components don't rotate or behave in ways that could simplify the design and this causes you to spend more time searching for a solution that works than necessary even when you know what you have to do. It also deters you from wanting to find an optimal solution. I've had more fun working with ancient PCB routing software thanks to it's auto-routing functionality.Verdict: Excellent game made unfun by UI. If you can look past it I highly recommend the game.
77,2544,"A puzzle game which is on par with the Zachtronics games, if you only consider the quality of the puzzles. I really hate the pixelated graphics though. Even in a small window the pixels are far too big."
78,2543,"Really good game. I like it better than ShenzenIO and recent Zachronic programming game and at the same level as SpaceChem. The difficulty curve is not that bad and you don't have to do all the puzzle in sequence so you if you are stuck on one, you can continue and come back later.Don't expect any story though."
79,2542,"Thumbs up for fans of Infinifactory, Space Chem etc, this is one of those games that will make you think and fire on all logic circuits in your brain. Completing levels is satisfying and the game features charts for efficiency and speed like other games of this kind. Be forewarned it is quite difficult and should probably only be attempted if you have some familiarity with logic circuits such as And gates or basic programming skills, or just really enjoy this type of game. Anyway, this game has my recommendation for fans of the genre, hope to see more from these guys."
80,2538,"Contains a rather challenging set of low-level computing problems. The tools on offer are few but robust. The game starts with an easy to follow tutorial, but then opens up considerably. You're left to tinker with and discover the nuances of the chips at your disposal.The pixel art is also a pretty unique feature for this kind of game."
81,2537,"One of the best puzzle game i have played so far.The problems are electronic oriented, and very challenging. You really need to think a lot to solve some problems, but when you do... the satisfaction is great.The design of the game is also very pleasant."
82,2535,"If you like 'Zach-like' open ended puzzle games, you will probably enjoy this one as well. At least up to a certain point. As stated in the game and by other reviews, the game ramps up in difficultly extremely quickly. I managed to get decently far, and I have some idea idea how to solve some of the later puzzles from completing similar ones in TIS-100, Shenzhen I/O, etc. but the limitatations the game imposes on creating the required circuity layouts and conditional logic flow , to me at least, starts to cross the boundaries of being more than just a fun challange that requiring some higher level thinking into very daunting and tedious tasks. And the controls leave something to be desired, I feel like editing my circuits layouts is more clumsly and time consuming than it could be.Lastly, I wish the developers would consider adding in 'HD' mode to the puzzle interface. I get thatr the lower res artwork may be a stylistic choice any/or less expensive to implement. But I think having a sharper look to the puzzles would be really nice for those of us with less than great vision.Overall I'd give it 7/10"
83,2535,"its a zach like, the grapichs are awesome, great retro vibe ,good soundrecommended10/10  i like to buy the same game over and over againedit: this is in my opinion THE BEST zach like on steamhad to say that because i think its realy that good"
84,2534,Good Zachlike game.
85,2533,"Prime Mover is really well done, I love the animations. The puzzles are quite difficult and have that Zachtronics feel to them. Which is quite a compliment because that's exactly what Prime Mover was going for.Also they've made some quality of life improvements that really help.While I'm pretty bad at Prime Mover I do recommend it for people who are into these kinds of puzzle games. The puzzles are pretty dang tough so it's not a matter of powering your way through. You do need to think and come up with a real solution."
86,2531,"If TIS-100 and SpaceChem had a baby, Prime Mover would be it. It's no secret that this game was heavily inspired by the Zachtronics games, but it's also fairly unique in its own way. There's a lot less puzzles in this than in your average Zachtronics game, but they're also incredibly more difficult. Often when I reach a new problem, the task will seem so overwhelmingly daunting that I will just turn the game off and stop playing for days. But all the while, the puzzle lingers in the back of my mind, until suddenly I'll get an idea for a solution and hop right back in. And to me, the high difficulty makes them all the more satisfying to solve.Thankfully the difficulty stems from actually figuring out the logic of the puzzle, rather than space constraints. The main playing board is 8x8, but the game also gives you customizable sub-boards that are 7x7 each. And you can even put sub-boards inside of sub-boards, giving you in theory infinite space to work with, assuming you can manage to get everything connected up correctly.To use another Zachtronics comparison, this makes the game a lot less frustrating than Shenzhen I/O which had very restrictive space constraints, but also much more challenging than Opus Magnum's infinite playing grid, as you need to carefully design each sub-board to interact with the boards above it in a meaningful way.As of now I've got a few more puzzles left in the game to solve. I'm not sure if I'll ever be able to solve all of them, but I'm quite sure I'll have fun trying. Due to the high difficulty I'm not sure if I can recommend it to newcomers to this genre of logic/programming puzzle games. But if you've got experience in a couple of the others I've mentioned, I guarantee this will be right up your alley. For me it was definitely worth it."
87,2531,"This game is so absurdly ugly I nearly dismissed it out of hand. As it is, it seems to have enough fun mechanics to get into, but is seriously hampered by the presentation. The pixelated graphics are an active detriment to play. Icons in the toolkit are hard to read because they all look like orange car crashes. Text is hard to read, especially if you don't put on the ""legible text"" graphics option. Even with it, cutscene text just looks like a bunch of blocks to me. Is it meant to be an alien language, or English? Not enough pixels to tell. This game may have a setting, possibly even a story. I couldn't possibly know.Puzzle space is seriously limited by the available pixels, and the developers clearly realised this, because they've included an ""Integrated Circuit"" device to extend your board. This is an interesting mechanic, somewhat like Spacechem's reactors, but I was surprised to find none of the scoring metrics acknowledge it. I suppose they'd rather people feel like they have room to move. At this point I've only solved two non-tutorial puzzles, but that's already taken a bit of fun conceptual planning and a lot of furious tinkering (often due to misunderstanding the mechanics, which can be a good and a bad feeling but is something I expect to run into early in a game like this).It's an interesting game, so far, but I really wish they'd made some different decisions on visual design."
88,2530,"Prime Mover has me thoroughly impressed. It does have a couple issues like its steep difficulty curve and the inability to take notes in the game, but these are very minor complaints. I love just about everything else the game has to offer: The aesthetic is flawless and consistent across the full experience, the obscured story was compelling enough to to keep me pushing forwards, the interactivity around the puzzle was a nice distraction when I needed it, and man oh man, the puzzles themselves are simultaneously extremely satisfying to solve, and extremely challenging; They had me experiencing the full spectrum of emotion.Don't let the difficulty put you off though, as the way it's laid out helps in that you don't have to solve every puzzle one by one. You can jump around, and if you're stuck, take a break and try something else and come back later. That said, don't expect to solve every puzzle in the game without becoming an absolute expert. As of writing, I've only finished just enough puzzles to be able to see every cutscene, and when I took a peak at the instructions for the final level, I started laughing hysterically because it looked so intimidating. I'll definitely keep jumping back in to solve my remaining puzzles, but I think I'll leave out that one!So I said Prime Mover has me impressed. That's because I normally don't see this caliber of programming-like game out of anyone but Zachtronics or (less so) Tomorrow Corporation. 4Bit Games, in one shot, have proven themselves worthy of contending with the greats of the genre, and I can't wait to see what they do next. If what you see is interesting to you, definitely check it out, and tell your friends; It's always fun to compare your speed / efficiency, and especially helpful to talk through your solutions and share ideas."
89,2530,"Prime Mover is a programming puzzle game where you drag and drop logic elements on to a circuit board to complete input and output requirements of the level. The art style is great and I like the inclusion of the circuit board element which effectively allows you to circumvent any space constraints and always produce an original solution, but this is the first one of these kinds of games that I am not recommending. The story is difficult to interoperate and the puzzle design isn't very good because each level attempts to be more punishing than the last rather than provide an interesting alteration on the previous puzzle or give the player a different perspective. The puzzles don't typically build on the logic applied in the previous solution. Partly because your solutions can be very original, but more so that the difficulty curve is pointed directly upwards. Puzzle games of old used to provide additional challenge with each level, but modern design accounts for player fatigue, attempts to promote eureka moments and asks the player to repeat what they have learned or a solution, but with subtle and insightful alterations that increase the players depth and understanding of the tools at their disposal. I recommend that you save your money and play Human Resources (very easy to pick up), Shenzhen I/O (ingenious and complex) or Infinifactory (the Minecraft of programming puzzles) instead.2/5P.S as an after thought. I should point out that all levels can be completed by disposing of the input and sending a pre-programmed output, all without producing an algorithmic way of modifying the input to the correct output value."
90,2530,"I love Zachtronics. Not for making this game (because he didn't), but for essentially being responsible for its ultimate creation.Open-ended programming puzzle games basically didn't exist until Zachtronics came along and made four of them (also, he's since made a fifth). It wasn't until then that I started to see similar Zachlikes (a term coined by someone at Rock Paper Shotgun, to mean open-ended programming puzzlers) made by people other than Zach.Prime Mover is a Zachlike, and, if you're familiar with Zach's Zachlikes, Prime Mover is the love-child of Spacechem and TIS-100. You place pieces on a circuit board, each of which has an effect similar to a command in Assembly.Something I particularly like about Prime Mover is the integrated circuit component. This allows you to place a circuit board in the circuit board, expanding a single tile into a 7x7 grid. Better yet, you can put integrated circuits inside integrated circuits. It's a board within a board within a board! I don't know how deep the maximum nested circuit is, but it's most certainly deep enough. Inception would be pleased.Something I really like about Prime Mover is its difficulty curve. It starts with about a dozen tutorial levels that demonstrate the basic workings of the game, then immediately and completely unshackles everything. It literally states that every puzzle afterward will be very hard, and it's not kidding. If you don't have a mind for low-level programming, you'll be lost in no time. And frankly, that's great, because it means that every solution to every non-trivial puzzle will be organic, and that the ranking histograms will be as true as possible."
91,2530,"If you like this type of game then yeah I mean it's good. Didn't actually finish it, I found at a certain point the puzzles were more working around the size of your board than working on solving the actual problem."
92,2530,"Wow, this is ramping up fast...It's a low-level programming game comparable to Zachtronic's games, where you have a very limited instruction set (of placeable items, no text input) to solve increasingly complex problems.The first 13 levels (of 34 total) serve as tutorial, then come 5 easy ones like building a transistor, and then it starts to get tricky and further to completely mind baffling.While there is limited space on the board (8x8 tiles), you can use integrated circuits with 7x7 tiles to enlarge your working space - even nesting is allowed (circuits inside circuits) and I haven't come across any limit for them yet. Looking at the histograms for solutions found, some of the graphs of the last levels extend to the use of several thousand elements, so there might not be a limit at all).The only negative I can think of is the absence of randomized tests for your solutions. Every puzzle has its own set of never-changing inputs/requested outputs, so to get a spot in the top section of the histograms you pretty much have to design a solution specific to the inputs instead of developing a robust, 'come what may, I can handle it'-solution.Speaking of histograms, the game uses the same approach as Zachtronics to compare you (with exact numbers) with people on your friends list - which is just great if you finally get a score better than that one guy who beats you on almost every level in all of the Zach games :)I doubt I'll ever finish it, I've about 10 levels remaining, and the descriptions alone make my head spin.The final ones are very, very advanced. But I had a lot of fun so far (about 10 hrs in) and think this game is totally worth the 10 I paid for it. Thumbs up."
93,2530,"Pretty nice Zachlike game. Its most unique twist on the genre is the ""sub-board"" feature, where you can put nested boards on your initial board, and also into each other without a depth limit. This means you can build very complex things from your simple tools, things that would be impossible with just using the initial board.I was a bit frustrated with the limitations of the chips at first. Some of them seem to be deliberately designed to be awkward to use. Once I got past this frustration and figured out useful combinations of chips to do typical tasks, it became the same kind of fun Zachtronics games are. It's definitely not for everyone, but if you've enjoyed Zachtronics games, you're pretty likely to enjoy this one, too!"
94,2529,"Great, thought-provoking puzzles."
95,2526,"Prime Mover is a great logical puzzle game. It is definitely not for everyone, but if it clicks for you, it is a lot of fun and very addicting.You have to implement different operations, like reordering or adding numbers, using a small palette of components you can place on a circuit board. After very few levels, there are no more limitations and you can lay out your circuits freely to solve the given problem. There are no more artificial constraints and the challenge becomes to master the tools you have at hand, much like exploring a programming language.This game is hard. Even if youre used to problem solving or programming, the game will present a serious challenge for you. It demands a lot of concentration and diligence. But it is also highly rewarding and I feel there is something to be gained here, like real training of logical thinking.The circuit board you have available is only spaced 8x8 tiles but you can place an infinite number of sub-chips, and sub-chips within sub-chips, each giving you another 7x7 grid. This forces you to lay out you circuit efficiently and think about the structure of you circuit. However, it should be noted that you do not actually learn about real circuits or a real computers here. The circuit boards are no real electronic circuit boards, but rather what if circuit boards worked like conveyor belts-circuit boards. I think it is a clever decision, because it makes the whole set up more appealing.The presentation is very minimalistic. There is no real story here, only some cryptic cutscenes here and there to break things up. They feature lovely pixel art and suffice to nicely set the mood for the following puzzles. Within the puzzles, there are a lot of little animations to make things feel right.I very much recommend this game, Im having a lot of fun with it and it is very addicting. But it is definitely very very nerdy."
96,2526,"## Review only applicable to state of game at time of review ##Summary: Digital pseudo-circuit designing game. Very underrated. Desperately needs expansions, or a sequel.Details: Perfect art style. Good choice of cryptic alien atmosphere. Smooth and polished gameplay mechanics. Very skill based. Good histograms. And smaller attention to detail that makes the game a masterpiece.The biggest problem with the game is how little of it there is. The soul of the game is trapped in a small body, and that is a tragedy.If there were twice as many levels, with new challenges and concepts, that would partially solve this. But letting it be how it is now just feels like a waste of a miracle.Certainly recommended to anyone with either a technical mind, or significant patience, the satisfaction of a working design is indescribable. This coupled with the interface and atmosphere of the game completes the whole experience."
97,2526,"It's very satisfying finding a solution and just being able to fast forward as it does its job. An update just came out which addresses a lot of the concerns in the earlier reviews, such as being able to change the color of the integrated circuits and having the copy/paste default to copy, not cut. Many small things have been changed that help with the overall experience. I would recommend this game if you enjoy a puzzle and not always having the solution be obvious at first."
98,2525,Tickled my brain in the perfect way!
99,2525,"Overall a good ""Zach-like"" programming/optimization game, with nice aesthetics.If you're familiar with Zachtronics' games, this is very similar to their games (even using their histogram server for high scores.) I found it to be around the difficulty level of TIS-100 (the median puzzle is probably a bit easier than the median TIS-100 puzzle, but the hardest puzzle is probably harder.)The functionality is a little rough around the edges;In later levels when you want to nest many modules and use sub-routines from prior puzzles, it would be nice if there was a way to store multiple""blueprints"", or even just being able to copy without cutting and then pasting back into place. I also find myself wishing we could set breakpoints on the inputs when my solutions fail at a partiuclar input.However these issues are relatively minor, and don't hinder the gameplay significantly."
100,2525,it's good
101,2525,"If you're a fan of Zachtronics games, I can quickly tell you that you'll enjoy this.The pixel art is charming, and the soundtrack is just right for getting the player into problem-solving mode. The difficulty of each chapter increases steeply, and later levels build on the player's existing knowledge of simpler circuits from earlier levels (for instance, a multiplication circuit requires knowledge of how to add two numbers together).Completing a level is immensely satisfying and I find myself motivated to retry them in order to minimize my solution time and cost. I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes a good puzzle."
102,2525,I had low expectations and this 100% blew them away! Great circuitry/coding game. Starts out slow but once you're out of the tutorial zone it really gets going.
103,2525,"This is a great game if you are looking for some puzzle solving. It has great art, beautiful music and it is very hard to put aside once you have started on a puzzle. I just love it!"
104,2525,"I always enjoy these programming games, especially when the programming is done in a visual way.Prime Mover is a beautiful game, with an amazing sound track and super fun problems to solve.Revisiting previous problems trying to optimize the solution to see how you fare against other players is also a fun and rewarding experience.The game has a story that unfolds as you solve problems that adds a bit of depth and mystery that is a nice touch for this kind of game.All in all, I would highly recommend Prime Mover to anyone who enjoys using their problem-solving skills!"
105,2525,"It has great pixel art that doesnt scale well with resolution and a fantastic sound track.A shame the dev was too lazy to be bothered to program any form of functionality into the tools. Theres no logic here. No inventiveness nore creativity can help you. All you do is brute force the numbers you need through logic. You can legit solve most puzzles by simply modifying the values given to get your desired out come and then destroy the rest. It's very much a work hard for something simple that could have been better if the developer got his thumb out of his @$$ and did work. You want the simplest example? theres a puzzle where you have positive and negative numbers with zeros mixed in. Remove the zeroes and send everything else. You also get a tool that sorts positives, negatives, and zeros. The catch? The idiot dev didnt make it so you could sort all 3. You can pick 2, but if the third shows up it jams up your entire machine.""oh then just divert them to different paths using some other tool no?"" I promise this sorting device is THE MOST COMPLEX tool you will ever get. It isnt even built correctly. You cant shove things onto other paths, only make them converge. You can clone  but the most interesting thing you can do is add or subtract from it. Theres no logic you implement, no mechanical integration to make things do more than just whats in the description.And as I just mentioned, half the time items arent even capable of thier full description. Get Infinifactory. Atleast the devs made a predictable system that isnt gutted by the inept developers not building out the tools correctly."
106,2525,"This is one of the first games I've seen to take Zachtronics head-on at his own game, and it does it quite well. Sound design is nothing to write home about but gets the job done, puzzles are suitably diabolical, and the spritework is really nice but a bit too low-res for the size the game displays at (with no options for window size other than manually stretching it so that the pixel-perfect ratio is ruined). Puzzle instructions are at times unclear, but you can usually figure it out just by looking at the input and output.I'm at kind of a crossroads with it, though, and one that I feel potential buyers should be aware of. The introductory ""puzzles"" are little more than a very, very simple tutorial. As soon as you hit the actual puzzles, the difficulty will skyrocket. I'm now four puzzles in and completely stonewalled less because of the puzzle itself, but because one of the ten components you have at your disposal to solve puzzles with is literally designed to be so obtuse as to be a puzzle in and of itself to operate.Basically, yes, like most of the others in the genre, this game WILL make you feel like an absolute idiot. It's not as accessible as it looks."
107,2525,Beautifully done open-ended puzzle game. If you've played any of the games that ranks your solution compared to other users you probably get the general gist of this game though the rules are different obviously. Game has a very distinct discrete mathematics feel to it in the sense that you're basically trying to create the most efficient algorithm. Game is simple (in a good way) but challenging. Probably one of my favorite of the open-ended puzzle games available if not THE favorite. Has a pretty interesting story mechanic as well.
108,2524,"Pretty steep difficutly spike, but the reward is soooo good"
109,2524,"A great problem solving game about making circuit boards, complete with histograms and the ability to save multiple solutions."
110,2524,"Zachtronics game, except not made by Zach. Pretty good."
111,2524,"All in all, it's a good game! Awesome music and pixel art. No complaints here.However, I have some issues with the game design that ruined it for me. I hope this will be taken as constructive criticism! I'd love these changes in a future update, if possible.1. PacingThe game attempts to handhold you through a couple of trivial levels with obvious solutions, and then abruptly drops you into the middle-difficulty levels. I found the difficulty spike to be a bit high. Not too bad, though.2. ControlsAs far as I know, there is no eyedropper tool for chip kinds. This makes it tiresome to make small adjustments to your circuits. The selection tool, while welcome, is cumbersome to use. It doesn't follow the ""left-click interacts non-destructively, right click deletes"" intuition all other tools build, which made me lose my work more than once (I keep right-clicking to clear space or left-clicking to enter a sub-chip). If you want to copy something into a sub-chip, you need to do many cumbersome steps: equip selection tool, right-click to discard current selection, draw the rectangle to select your desired components, equip any other tool (just so that you don't overwrite the chip), enter chip, re-equip selection tool and finally paste it. For chips to be an intended and encouraged game mechanic, this is really repetitive work (especially since it wasn't obvious to me at first that the selection tool remembers the selection in between ""equips"").3. Lack of library or snippet storageGiven the size and complexity of the later levels, the game seems to want you to reuse parts you've done in previous ones, such as using an adder to implement the multiplier. However, you're given no way to efficiently handle them. Whenever you want to copy something you needed in a previous level, you have to close the current level and go select it on the previous one. When you select what you want, it is effectively removed from the board, and so you need to paste it back down and reconnect the wires so that you don't ruin the level you've already finished.And if you need a lot of snippets, good luck remembering which is which, because all of the chips look exactly the same, with no means of customization or labeling.Also, there's no good way to rotate the sub-chip's contents, which encourages you to work around it just so that you don't have to do the whole thing again rotated 90 degrees. And, if you actually do it, there's now an additional 3 variations of the chip to keep track of (more if you do the mirror images too).All of this amounts to a lot of repetitive, unergonomic work on circuits you've already solved, that stands in the way of solving the actual level and makes you feel very unproductive. For a game that wants you to spend hours optimizing solutions, it sure makes it needlessly painful.I don't regret buying the game, but I'll put off solving the last couple levels until at least some of these issues are addressed, maybe in a future update. I just don't have that kind of free time."

113,2524,"The game starts with a comprehensive but simple (and quick!) tutorial, and then leaps over to large more open problem-solving. As a programmer i just can't get enough of this kind of gameplay where you get a logical problem/issue and it needs to be resolved. You can resolve it in the easiest way that you find, but the real thrill is in making optimized circuits with the least amount of components.The music is by the same composer that made the music to beatiful owlboy, and being able to listen to a so well pack of composed music while doing problem-solving is just perfect.The game is hoverer not completely free for bugs. Myself i experienced some issues with the resolution being incredible small, but the devs are fast to fix this kind of problems. (Just hours after i reported the bug, they reported back if i could test the beta branch to see if the problem was solved. Sure it was!)One downside to this game is the lack of keyboard and gamepad-support. (As of May 23.) (I havent tested with gamepad, but since its not specefied in the store-page and keyboard-support isnt there, i assume gamepad doesnt work as well). I have asked the devs trough their discord if this is something they will add and hopefully they will add this ASAP.I also struggled with reading the text since its in this kind of spriteart-font, but they have an ""accesibility"" option that solved that issue for me. But calling it for an accessibility-font might be an overstatement since the text is still rather small.Support for saving blueprints and even making your own problem-rulesets would be awesome!TLDR: If you like ""technical"" problem-solving puzzles this game is for you. I am four hours into the game and it seems i am not even halfway in the scenario/overworld-map, so this game is definitely worth the money!(Just for transparency: I am a huge supporter of the Norwegian Games Industry, and i've had the honour of meeting the developers on multiple occasions. Game was bought for my own money.)"
114,2524,It scratches the itch that only Zachlikes can...
115,2524,"Prime Mover is a ""zachlike"" logic puzzle and optimization game. Your goal is to process and route numbers on a virtual circuit board. Adding two numbers might sound simple, until you realize that you have to create your own addition circuit with switches, locks, buttons, comparisons to 0 and increment / decrement components. You'll also create your own designs for various math functions, logic gates, transistors, memory etc.So far (after a bit over 10 hours) I've solved 10 of what seems like 21 puzzles, plus 13 tutorial levels. If the difficulty curve keeps up its current pace, I'm sure the final task will be to create a working quantum computer. ;)  Your solutions are rated by the amount of components you've used and how many 'ticks' it took to process all the data. After verifying that your solution works, the game will display graphs that show you how your idea ranks on the global leaderboard. You're also shown how your Steam friends performed, and this is where a lot of the fun comes from, at least for me. Going back and optimizing your solutions to brag with screenshots on Discord, only to be demolished 10 minutes later. Of course you don't have to strive for perfection and it's even possible to nest infinitely (?) many sub-boards to create all the space you need.There's a feel of progression to the puzzles. If you've built your own transistor, then an AND gate is a piece of cake. You can even copy-paste parts from other puzzles, move them around the board and rotate or mirror them. You found a sweet solution for a puzzle, but it takes a while to run through all the data? Just copy it to a sub-board, duplicate it and run it in parallel!I also like the presentation and soundtrack of Prime Mover. There are little animations all around and overall the game feels polished. There's even a story. But figuring out what's it about, is a puzzle in itself. It might not be a game for everyone, but if you're looking for challenging logic puzzles then this one is an easy recommendation. Also check out the various Zachtronic games."
116,2524,"Cool little ""Circuitry"" game - If you liked Spacechem or Silicon Zeroes this might appeal to you.Pros:- Great presentation, lots of tiny animations makes the game come alive- Interesting and varied collection of puzzles, from simple to extremely complexCons:- Later game focuses on circuits inside ""chips"", but there's no blueprint library to store commonly used chips for later use- Some component limitations seem to only exist to increase difficulty and feel arbitrary, like the comparator which only allows three connections while four seems natural- Pretty steep difficulty jump from simple designs to advanced without much explanation. If you want a ""design a CPU with wires from scratch"" game, Silicon Zeroes is more educational and thorough"
117,2524,"Probably the first take on a Zachtronics game that I got to play that feels well thought out and interesting. If I had to describe it to fans of the genre, I'd say it's a more limited version of Spacechem, mixed with TIS. It'll have you performing complex tasks, with numbers as your input, with you transferring the numbers along a conveyor belt that can perform very basic operations (such as adding or subtracting 1 from the number, or alternating between two different conveyor belts), in order to manipulate those numbers to a different output. If that sounds complex, that's because it is! But the simple presentation, good visuals, good music and brain twisting puzzles make it very enjoyable to fans of puzzle games, in particular the genre of ""open solution puzzle games"" that Zachtronics like to make.Definitely recommended!"
118,2524,"Great, complicated, coding/design/puzzle game in the tradition of Manufactoria, but without some of that game's frustrations.  Specifically, you aren't hampered by space or time constraints - and the ability to make sub-boards within sub-boards means you can be as organized as you like while solving.  If you're a real masochist, you can go for a high score (minimizing ""ticks"" or chips), but the puzzles are satisfying enough to solve without any constraints on design.I'm not through the game yet, but so far haven't hit any bugs or issues.  The game is quite complicated, though, and has a few fairly abrupt jumps up in difficulty that may be frustrating if you haven't done this kind of stuff before.  If you're new to the quirky-pseudo-programming genre, maybe start with Human Resource Machine - which is solid, comparable game that's a bit more accessible.But if you're ready for the challenge, so far I think this is the best game in this genre."
119,2524,"I just completed a discrete mathematics course less than two weeks ago (Spring 2018), and this game could have taught me logic and circuitry in a much more efficient and engaging manner than my professor did. Unfortunately, my solutions are about as optimized as my former professor's lesson plan and execution. Hopefully just for now.10/10 for the game3/10 for my solutions1/10 for community college professors with nothing better to doUpdate: My solutions are improving and this game is awesome. If this subject interests you at all, get the game."
120,2524,Fun little game. Art and music are great. Puzzles get progressively harder. There appear to be 34 puzzles in total. First 13 levels being easier tutorial levels.
