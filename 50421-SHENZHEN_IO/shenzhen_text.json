But there's such a thing as \"entry experience\" in games, and the smoother that is, the better the game will fare.  There's a lesson they learned somewhere in there, when you compare the gameplay\/interfaces of TIS-100, Shenzen, and Exapunks.  TIS laid its premise and logic bare from the beginning, and it was up to the player to stare at it long enough to understand.  Exapunks went the other direction, layering story and nostalgia and abstracting the core puzzle play enough to make it interesting.But the key is that in Exapunks, the abstracted gameplay is still placed in front of the player.  With Shenzen, you re-directed twice from opening emails, asked to literally print out and tab the manual (!), and even then, the entry point into the game narrative isn't clear without some diddling about.  IMPORTANT:  Your games are ABOUT logic puzzles.  Your fans aren't afraid of them, nor need a cover story.  In Shenzen, I've never seen a cover story or abstraction so badly implemented.  Sorry, but if an interested, motivated player is left staring at a screen with no useful information, nor clear way to access said useful information, you aren't doing it right.  I'm sure I'll continue to play once I understand the silly cover story and abstractions, but it shouldn't require this much work.  Give me TIS-100 all day over this.","Possibly one of the best programming games I've played!","This game requires extensive use of the game manual to look up datasheets and such.So if you are still here after the word manual; then you'll probably like this games. The puzzles are fun and require some thought to accomplish. I've played other games in this style and they tend to have some monotonous solutions. I do feel that Shenzhen I\/O avoids that route and instead focuses on minimizing code.","Expect an unforgiving challenge, but this is a culmination of previous Zachtronics programming games.  Shenzhen I\/O's worldbuilding truly goes above and beyond to provide ample context for an enjoyable crash course in programming and circuitry.","The perfect game to introduce someone into the Zachtronics games, if you aren't already a codemonkey.I had bought a couple of their other games purely because the concept intrigued me, but the learning curve was too steep. When i picked this one up, I actually printed the manual (on a whim) and really figured it all out. That being said, there's not a single other game that has made me feel so satisfied when I figure out the solution to the puzzle. I'm not generally animated, but i find myself fist pumping and getting up to hug my daughter when I finally get it. The pacing of the game is nice, the way it introduces new ideas is slow and steady, not to mention how much thought they put into the worldbuilding. it's the little things, folks.I'll update it when i get further, but after playing the amount i have, i already plan on adding their other games to my collection.","Update: After some reading and thinking I finally realised why I don't like this game, I suck at making algorithms and due to the structure of some of the puzzles it's nearly impossible to brute force solutions like in ExapunksSo if you want coding puzzles and like making algorithms get this game, if you want coding puzzles and algorithms hurt your brain get Exapunks.Old review:I bought this because I enjoyed Exapunks, but I am not enjoying Shenzhen I\/O. I don't know if it's the differences in the documentation (helpful 'zines vs a barebones tutorial and terrible datasheets) or just because Shenzhens puzzles are a lot more space constrained, but I'm am finding the later puzzles in Shenzhen to be impossible without looking up tips or solutions on Reddit. Maybe I'm not the target audience, but I feel like the game could be a lot more accommodating if it had an easy mode (more space on the board or in the MCs) or if there was some way to get tips in game (like extra emails from Carl or Jie if you get stuck)So if you came here hoping to find something similar to Exapunks you might end up being disappointed like me."],["simply amazing"],["This is easily the most immersive puzzle game I have ever played and my personal favorite of all the Zachtronics games, possibly because I have lived as an expatriate in China similar to the player character.

You're given puzzles (in the form of serious assignments from your boss or wacky product ideas from your company's goofy \"concept guy.\")  Then you design them and see how you did compared to other players of the game.The gameplay is a little like TIS-100 in that it's programming in an absurdly limited assembly language, although some specifics of the language differ slightly.  But TIS-100 didn't give you any flexibility in the way the code modules are connected, so it never felt like you were creating something, it just felt like you were trying to find the solution to a puzzle.  Here, your design has to meet the spec and pass the tests, but you're given much more flexibility in how to approach it.  So you're not looking for \"the\" solution, you're looking for \"your\" solution.  That makes it so much more fun, and more rewarding to chase after a good solution instead of one that just barely works.The game has interesting characters and just enough window dressing that it just \"feels real.\"  TIS-100 seemed so much more sterile.  Sure, you only interact with the characters through email, but is that really that different from most NPCs in games?Presenting most of the game's documentation in the form of product datasheets... well, if you've done any electronics design, it'll seem very familiar, and it makes the game feel more realistic.Overall, it's fun, with the caveat that it is a Zachlike and so it is naturally not for everyone.  But if the idea of a game that blurs the lines between logic puzzles and programming seems fun, then give it a shot.","Really fun for the geeks out there.

As always with these games, it might be a little too difficult for me, but it's still a lot of fun to play.","Shenzhen I\/O is a programming game that kind of cleverly simulates a job. Maybe think of it as Euro Truck Simulator for software development. The home screen is made up to mimic a desktop with an email client that you use to access your assignments. Each assignment is a programming puzzle in an invented form of assembly. The game comes with a manual pdf that you must read explaining the language and hardware.To solve the puzzle you have to choose and arrange hardware elements, writing assembly to run on each of the elements. Your solution is then validated against test cases (pairs of input and expected output) to determine if you have found a correct solution. The puzzles can be quite challenging and I find it hard to imagine that anyone that doesn't already have experience programming (either in school, professionally or as a hobby) could enjoy it. That isn't because any particular real-world knowledge is required to solve any puzzles, but I think the style of thinking would just be too foreign if you didn't already have experience with it.The fictional desktop is very cute and amusing. It has really well designed 'startup' and 'shutdown' sounds that perfectly mimic retro OS sounds with a slightly oriental flair. The desktop even has a unique form of solitaire!

It really questions my abilities as a programmer - BUT FOR FUN."],["The same warnings apply as with TIS-100: This is about writing code in a made-up assembly language with absurd limitations, and drawing some (minimalistic) circuits, while reading from a manual PDF (which they recommend printing out). You will need to read the manual.It's hard to talk about a Zachtronics game, except by comparing it to others. So, this is TIS-100, plus some of the best of Infinifactory, but also some of the worst of SpaceChem.The main thing it brings over from Infinifactory is a level of polish, which delivers a real theme and atmosphere other than just \"arcane 80's nonsense\":There are recognizable characters that stick with you for most of the story. Even just having an avatar thumbnail adds so much to being able to recognize and follow these jerks through the story.There's a whole Solitaire game thrown in just because, and it's actually legitimately fun, to the point where you may find yourself procrastinating on the actual problem-solving of this game to play Solitaire!There's full Steam Workshop integration, which the game goes out of its way to encourage. When it does, I'd recommend checking out some of the puzzles people are uploaded -- I picked up a couple of tricks from some rather unique puzzles.Modern resolutions, a modern-ish UI, and some music all makes for an experience that's... I guess still charmingly retro in some ways, but much more pleasant to be in for the number of hours it will take to finish this game.Many solution slots per level -- all Zachtronics games before this restrict you to exactly three. You can use this as a poor-man's version control by copying your solution before you attempt a drastic rewiring.And one more thing it has in common with Infinifactory: Stuff you could always do, but the game holds off on teaching you how. With Infinifactory, it's the fact that you can attach pulverizers (among other blocks) to pistons. Shenzhen I\/O feels a little cheaper: There's an undocumented instruction you'll be told about later. It is actually in the manual, it's just that the manual's English translation is deliberately incomplete.But it brings back one big thing from SpaceChem that I really didn't miss: Space constraints so tight that, even once you discover that you can hold tab and draw wires\/buses underneath components, your solutions will barely fit, and most of your time will be spent finding incredibly tricky wiring to squeeze one more component in, or barely thread a signal through from one side of the board to the other, or squeezing just one more assembly instruction onto a microcontroller.I think part of it is the requirement to optimize multiple space constraints at once -- SpaceChem had limited space in each reactor, and limited space in the overworld to place those reactors and connect them together with pipelines. Shenzhen I\/O has limited space for instructions within each controller, and limited board space to place your components (including controllers) and connect them together with wires.Shenzhen I\/O also has a flaw I don't think I've seen in Zachtronics before: Vague problem specifications. Several early problems require you to read the problem description extremely carefully, not just to avoid making an incorrect assumption, but to discover assumptions that technically aren't required, but will massively simplify the problem. I found two or three problems in the bonus campaign in which inputs are guaranteed to be single-digit values, and at least one of these never actually says that. You just have to notice the pattern on the verification tab, but you are only shown the first of 80 or so tests -- the only way to see if the pattern you've identified holds true for all tests is to build an entire solution around it!I'm playing through these in release order, and Infinifactory remains my favorite. That's probably partly because of how well it avoids the above problems: It's more generous with space, and the third dimension means there's usually more flexibility in how you fill that space. It felt almost as difficult, except the difficulty was in coming up with a solution in the first place, not in subtly moving solutions around. It had metrics like \"footprint\" in case you wanted to do that kind of thing, but then it was about getting a higher score, not just about completing the level! And of course, there's never any doubt about what the goal even is.","The next time someone brags about beating Dark Souls because it's 'hard' tell them to play halfway through this game.","how about some tutorial for the dumbs?"],["I'm big dumb but this game is still really fun once you get a hang of it.","I am a bit late to the Zachtronics library, but Shenzhen I\/O is a truly excellent puzzle game.While I am also a fan of TIS-100 (only other Zach title I have played so far), as an experience programmer I found it a little shallow.The component cost and physical space restrictions (component placement) of Shenzhen I\/O add a layer of depth that I found extremely engaging.The story element, while light, is also appreciated."],["This is voluntary overtime.","'S pretty good.Kinda puzzling though.","Awesome game.

I could play these games all day.This game was amazing from start to finish, very challenging (for me anyway, ive not got any real programming experience, only these types of games) but it keeps you gripped and wanting to come back for more.You pretty much have to print off the instructions for the game, which is presented in datasheets like you would expect from real electronic components. The datasheets give you examples of instructions you can perform with various chips and microcomputers, to solve different puzzles. The puzzles essentially consist of  giving you a bunch of numbers and you have to feed the results back in a computed format.The calculations are done using the coding in the game, its pretty simple once youve done the first couple of levels.

Just don't."],["Easily the weakest Zachtronics game so far. Not terrible, but you should really play all the other Zachtronics games first.It has some cool ideas (e.g. the unique test instructions and ability to use logic gates) that made me really want to like the game, but unfortunately they're overshadowed by the fact that a majority of puzzles are just about marshaling data between the different types of pins rather than actually solving interesting problems. The quirks in the instruction set, the parts list, and the rules surrounding inter-cpu communication seem designed to constantly throw you the same annoying roadblocks, rather than providing for interesting optimization opportunities like in TIS-100 and EXAPUNKS. Because of the need to synchronize not just communication (as in TIS-100) but also sleep cycles, and because of the comically small instruction counts, a majority of code in later puzzles ends up being the same repetitive synchronization idioms.In TIS-100, there was an interesting and fundamental tradeoff when splitting code across multiple nodes. It often increased the node count, usually led to higher instruction count, and could lose cycles to communication overhead. However, it also gave you more registers to work with, as well as opportunities for parallelism, pipelining, and (in some levels) smart use of the JRO instruction. But in Shenzhen, because the game measures POWER (total instructions retired across all CPUs) instead of CYCLES (time until all CPUs are sleeping), pipelining and parallelism are no longer relevant. And obviously more CPUs is bad for cost and lines-of-code as well, so instead of an interesting tradeoff, it's now just a Thing You Never Want To Do But Usually Have To, which just feels, like, bad, man, y'know?In fact, past the first few levels, there aren't many interesting tradeoffs to be made in general. What's good for one metric is usually good for the others, so it's more like you're trying to find the \"right\" answer rather than exploring multiple possible strategies which could lead to solutions that are good along different dimensions. It's more like traditional \"puzzle solving\", instead of the \"problem solving\" that Zachtronics games are known and loved for.If you want well-designed, hard-as-balls assembly programming challenges, I recommend TIS-100. If you want to have fun squeezing every last cycle out of your programs, I recommend EXAPUNKS. The only situation in which I'd recommend Shenzhen is if you've run out of other Zachtronics games to play.EDIT: I forgot to mention, but the solitaire is good.","This is simply the best programming game out there.

What else is there to say? f you liked other Zachtronics games and you're looking for more programming puzzles, then this is a blast. Not for the faint of heart. Some prior programming experience is recommended since in typical fashion you are entrusted to read the manual on your own, and you have no idea which command or part does what. (Some find this adds to the overall work simulation experience :p ).Obviously the meat of the puzzle is not just solving the design, but also optimizing it. I found it to be most similar to TIS-100 in that you're using assembly language and putting together discrete parts with minimal lines of code. However, I found this game to be more user-friendly than TIS-100, with a definite real-job feel. I also like that you have a variety of parts that each have slightly different functions.

I definitely see the potential fun for people. There is even a level that lets you get creative with all the modules in-game (which is where I ended up stopping).If you are like me and was thinking this will be more of a programming puzzle game that progresses slowly and builds on ideas as you you go, it is tougher to recommend.----------As someone that enjoyed SpaceChem and likes the idea of learning to program, I thought I would try my hand at this game. I do not have prior experience programming, unless you count what I learned in school 20 years ago that I haven't used since, and the very beginnings of learning to program with Python (so sweet f-all).Reading the manual that comes with the game, it seemed a bit daunting and then I started the first puzzle. Let's be clear, there is no real tutorial or step-by-step progression like Space Chem to learn how to play. You are jumping right in, and while the first few puzzles aren't really that hard, you will be spending a lot of time going back and forth to the manual trying to figure out the programming language, its limitations, and why things aren't working like you want them to. Unfortunately, the manual sometimes doesn't explain things very well.Take for instance the 'nop' or no operation command. The manual says \"This instruction has no effect\". What it really should say is that this instruction can be used to pause a module in order to sync commands with other connected modules. The only reason I know this is because the frustration got to the point where I had to see examples of other people solutions, and ended up seeing a post online that actually explained the uses of some of these commands. This made me feel like it defeats the purpose of playing a puzzle game, and turned me off.I don't mind being frustrated with figuring something out, but the amount of time spent inside and outside the game felt like it would be better spent getting frustrated and figuring out a real-world language that also didn't have the game's imposed limitations.I've since moved on to Exapunks and while that game also has you reading .pdf files to learn commands, it already there are more explanations, progression, and in-game tutorials to get you up to speed.

I don't really know coding at all so this is a doubly steep learning curve.  And really the hard part is memorizing the functions so you can more easily test your code instead of referencing the manual so much.  And besides that its learning how the software reads your code and works with conditions which is super simple but you need to get your mind right or at least I did.How it playsSo far at the most basic level you are provided an input and then required to change that into what the output needs to pass a simulation.  The input has a level of intensity so to speak and your output can as well.  There is a timing aspect called sleep (slp) that allows 'time' to pass otherwise the computer chip will just keep running your lines of code.  And once you've recognized the pins and what you are attempting then you test your code till you get the match.  You can test it step by step of instructions you've got in the chip or by advancing time one increment at a time; so you can always see exactly where your fault lies.  And like modern day coding software it'll point out all the times you've done something that doesn't compute.  I'm sure other coding software isn't this simple but you've barely got a handful of basic instructions, the usual math types, conditional types (for logic, you'll be using these a lot I imagine), and that's about it.DifficultyIs it hard?  Yes, but only because this isn't a FPS like I'm used to playing these days.  It is foreign to me.  Once I have an even better grasp of the rules like I can tell I'm getting after only 4 hours then I should be testing code at an incredible pace.Besides the difficulty in the sandbox-esq way of solving problems via code the other constraints can be things like your budget and number of lines of code per chip.  Can you run this request on one chip because the PCB is so small it could barely fit two chips?I GIVE THIS A DEFINITE BUY ESPECIALLY IF YOU ALREADY HAVE OTHER ZACHTRONICS GAMES BECAUSE YOU'LL KNOW KIND OF WHAT YOU'RE GETTING INTO.

The language is not very conducive to nested loops\/conditionals or even \"else if\"s, and you only get 12 lines of code or less to work with, which could definitely be off-putting to some. But for those of us who like seeing how few lines something can be coded in, how we can make shortcuts within the limited nature of the language, and even a little bit of hardware selection, there's quite a bit of depth and some significant replayability.The solitaire is more replayable though, it's really good.","My Computer Organization class should just have been playing this game.","OK.. this is significantly more difficult than ExaPunks, due in part to the way the manual works which is seemingly less informative, but having said that you do just have to play with the parts and see what each component does or doesn't do. You may have to look up some help to understand the nuances of the game, too me a little while to understand sleep and the errors around it (looking at reddit and other places it seems it's common issue). Once you get the hang of it, it's great. This isn't for everyone, and if gaming is meant to be relaxation, don't play this. It really makes you think hard.","It's fun, especially the solitaire minigame.","Write a review for SHENZHEN I\/OPlease describe what you liked or disliked about this game and whether you recommend it to others.Please remember to be polite and follow the Rules and Guidelines.","I'm by far no where near a coder, nor a smart dude.

They do provide a manual in pdf form, which they actually recommend printing out and putting in a binder, but I found that after watching a video just explaining the basics of the assembly code they use I've been able to progress, referencing the manual occasionally. I recommend playing this game if you like puzzles and problem solving, regardless of if you know how to code. Shenzhen can be a nice way to relax after a stressful day at work, as problem solving with no stress is quite enjoyable. I will say it's worth the full price for most people but some may only be satisfied with their purchase when it goes on sale.","Excellent!","It's a game where you write assembly.

Recommended for puzzle and coding enthusiasts.","If you are into code golf, you will love this!This game is like a series of code golf challenges but the source code size is not the only thing that you are forced to optimize for in this game. Some other things that make this game MORE FUN than a typical code golf challenge:- Very limited instruction set.- Very limited number of lines of code (LOC) can fit on a single microcontroller.- Extremely limited number of registers per microcontroller.- Want to have more registers or more LOC in your solution? Add another microcontroller to the board! But this will increase the cost of the design... And it is possible that it will not fit on the board at all... (after all, you are working on embedded systems) Or if it does fit, your life is now complicated by the fact that multiple microcontrollers need to communicate with each other, which means you have to deal with very limited number of IO ports per microcontroller and waste LOC doing IO plumbing.- Even if you optimize the design cost and LOC count, there is a third metric that you can do badly on which is \"power\". It's basically the \"time complexity\" of your solution as more LOC executed means more power expended.All of this forces you to come up with super hacky solutions which captures the very spirit of code golf!Oh, and briefings for each assignment relayed to you as emails from bosses and colleagues are pretty hilarious.","Out of all the programming puzzle games I've played so far, this one takes the crown. It is also one of the hardest and does not pull any punches even at the beginning. But that also makes it so rewarding when you finally manage to beat a really complex challenge after several hours of experimenting - and then you go back to the drawing board and try to optimize your solution to beat your friends' highscores.Word of warning: It barely has any ingame tutorials and instead tries to be immersive by providing you with a 40+ pages PDF manual of the various microcontroller components that are used throughout the game and its puzzles. You may even print it out if you want the full immersive experience of being a contract worker who creates little electronic gadgets according to customer specifications. Alternatively, having a second monitor to view the PDF on the other screen instead of tabbing out of the game can help a lot.But if a game that makes you feel like doing actual work is not your idea of a relaxing evening, this one may not be the right choice for you."],["big brain game","Great solitaire game, though with 3 suits instead of 4.

You are a young electrical engineer thrust into a coding environment with only a stack of data sheets and a few vague tips on how to complete the task. Nostalgia abounds as you rifle through a printed stack of notes to find snippets of information that will help you crack the latest challenge. The puzzles are very well chosen, and are tough enough to give you the buzz of working out a difficult challenge, but the limited code lines mean that this is more about being efficient than producing long, complex code that most modern programmers would have become accustomed to. As usual there's a bit of a backstory that helps sell the immersion, and another brilliant Zachtronics minigame in its take on a mahjong solitaire.  For those who remember, this is a throwback to writing code on extremely limited PIC microcontrollers, trying to create something under crazy small limits of total lines of code. It's very rare that this old artform is called into use these days, given the insane power in modern chips. It will remind you quite thoroughly of how good we have it now, but there is something beautiful about working withing very tight constraints. Definitely one of the more difficult of Zachtronic's games, the lack of physical elements as found in opus magnum and space chem, combined with a focus on hyper efficient programs makes debugging a little more difficult.

Unfortunately, this quickly devolves into a \"Worst Parts of Coding Simulator.\"1. Terrible Documentation.The documentation for the pseudo coding language is terrible. There is no organization to it. The keyword definitions are strewn throughout the 40 page booklet. This means you have to somehow save multiple random spots in the booklet in order to explore your options. One section of the keywords is just a tiny box in the corner, on a page about something else, completely out of context. Yuck.The documentation for the hardware is even worse. They simply don't define the rules for Xbus enough.  They don't talk about how micro processors that receive xbus are not allowed to sleep after catching the xbus input. This makes no sense, as the only way to advance time is to sleep. You can definitely sleep in 2 different micro processors if you use a p input.2. Extremely Destructive WorkflowYou are not allowed to have microprocessors on the worktable unless 1) they are hooked up to the circuit and 2) they have no syntax errors. This means that you can't have a couple of good chips written and on the side, and try swapping in your different solutions as you brainstorm. You only get one idea at a time. This is particularly infuriating because there is a clearly delineated \"active area\" and \"inactive area\" of the work table. You should definitely be able to put extraneous processors in the inactive area and run the program.3. Comments Not AllowedAlthough comments are implemented, you have, like, 24 characters available in each line. And you have so few lines of code in each micro chip that using one up just for a comment is both idiotic and impossible, because you need it for actual code. You will have no ROOM to put comments in. This makes remembering what your weird-ass assembly code constructions do really hard to remember, especially because of the other limitations of the language forcing you to do very awkward flow-control.4. Archaic Error MessagingThe error messages are so vague. It points at one line of code while complaining about a different component not sleeping.If you add a sleep to the only other component it could be talking about, it complains about sleeping on that line instead. This is just one example of seemingly inane and actively unhelpful error messages.Result:As the puzzles get harder, these annoyances become greatly magnified. Its all the parts I hate most about programming rolled up into a very tight package with literally no point to my suffering because this is a fake language in a fake game. All I do is spend my time feeling frustrated about problems that the game doesn't help me solve, even though I know which problems are holding me back. It becomes a struggle against the illogical results of the mechanics, and having no clear avenue for learning \"WHY\" such a strange thing is happening instead of a struggle against knowable mechanics and a continual learning process.

You will be reading datasheets, using logic gates, and of course, writing code in a surprisingly devious form of assembly.If you can withstand the technical nature of this, it is incredible. Zachtronics has really mastered the art of producing difficult puzzles that don't have a single correct solution. Instead, you get to optimize your solution on three criteria: cost (dictated by which components you use), power consumption (given by the amount of time your embedded system spends running code vs operating in sleep mode), and lines of code. Best of all, each solved puzzle grants you a histogram of user solutions for each criterion. This is great for allowing the player to adjust their difficulty. For instance, I have been focusing on reducing the number of components (it is what feels right as an electrical engineer). As such, my challenge becomes finding out how to use the hardware I do include to its fullest. I am sure that I could make my life even more complex by paying attention to power consumption and the number of lines of code, but I am happy with my current level of difficulty.In the past I tried to get started with TIS-1000, but I found it too dense.

The basic gist of the game is to place electron components then program the micro-controllers for the desired outputs based on a simulated set of inputs.  All well and good except they don't base anything on real world micro-controllers.  They use base10 instead of binary or hexadecimal.  They restrict you to 9 or 14 lines of programming code.  I don't know of a single real world micro-controller that is that restrictive.  The only pro I can say about this game is I love the mini solitaire game they included as a mini game.  BTW: I've programmed PIC micro-controllers and done a bit with SBCs (Arduino and Raspberry Pi).  In the long run this game was just way to restrictive on the coding.  Go get Opus Magnum instead.  I fully enjoyed that one since my only real restriction was the inputs and outputs.","Come for the assembly programming, stay for the solitaire.","looked cool, figured id give it a try.

The programming and engineering puzzles start off relatively easy, but quickly become complex and challenging.  It is one of the best of it's kind, but beating the puzzles requires quite a bit of thinking and tinkering in higher levels.  Very satisfying, if a solution is found.  And it can be compared to others with the chance of trying muliple approaches on the same puzzle optimizing the own way of completing a puzzle.  For newcomers without programming knowledge I would recommend to try Opus Magnum first, for people with at least basic knowledge about programming I would recommend Exapunks first.  Opus Magnum requires creative thinking and coordinating processes, which is also needed in the other games.  Exapunks I found a little bit easier due to lack of restriction to the number of usable programming lines per item. Please take my assessment with a grain of salt, as I have not finished either of these games yet.  But I find this assessment ringing true with other gamers enjoying Zachtronics titles.Edit:  The great Shenzhen Solitaire is also available on Steam without the main coding game.","Really makes you feeeel like an electrical engineer working a 9-5 job in China","good puzzles, and amusing backstory... has some weird basis in real life","This is a strange game.

I look forward to playing more.","assembler (low level) code programming with a story telling.Definitely worth to play if you like robotics, cyber techs or want to know how is it works exactly","based and solitairepilled","good","i bought this under the impression this was going to be a light coding game that would talk you through the basics and then gradually get more complex...I was wrong!This game has no tutorial, just a manual that requires memorising\/studying. By no means take this as a bad review, i just hadn't realised what i signed up for. If this seems like your kind of game i wish you the best of luck.","This game rocks. Potentially the best game I've ever played. Don't approach this as \"this will teach me proper programming\" or \"this will teach electrical engineering\", it does these things to a very small degree, but at a conceptual level. If you love Youtuber Ben Eater and his computer wiring projects, this game is for you. this is not a \"quick\" game, it will require some study of the 50 page manual (available ingame and online). It requires an inquisitive mind. The game mentioned computer registers, so before I knew it, I had spent 90 minutes on wikipedia reading about all the details how computer registers and accumulators really work. So wonderfully stimulating. I wish that the  \"on\" was set at a value of 1 instead of 100 and \"off\" at 0 but oh well. Who knows what units of voltage are used. The puzzles are very fun, the UI is super fun. It looks like how your computer screen would look if you worked for the great Longteng corporation. Believe it or not, there is a nice immersion element to the game. The people who email you feel quite real. Music is excellent. I printed out \"The Manual\" to get that real tactile feel in a 3 ring binder.  I can already tell this game will take many of my hours. The manual feels *very very* real. I remember having to wire Chinese manufactured sensor modules in graduate school, and having to pour over pdfs *just* like the manual ingame. For my friends in the solitaire community; The solitaire game is absolutely wonderful and enjoyable. *Super* addictive version of solitaire and somewhat more difficult.I was told by several people that this is Zachtronics best. I love this game.EDIT: Played additional 10-20 hours and game is even better. Now no longer happy with correct solutions to diagrams...we need low voltage usage and lowest production cost.Best $15 ever spent game-wise. Found Youtube videos of people wiring tetris ingame...amazing.."],["A masterpiece in its own subgenre of puzzles.The only bad things i can say about the game is that the manual lacks instruction set examples which are critical for noobs and that the avalon puzzles' specifications are too poorly explained. (they literally ask the player to figure it out by themselves by reading the verification, which is a big no no considering every puzzle before were concise in what it asked the player to do.)","Love it!

Contrary to some other reviews, you need no experience with real-life electrical engineering to play, I do embedded hardware design IRL and this is substantially different.

You literally have to figure  everything yourself.","I looked into Shenzhen I\/O assuming that the gamification of its high-level concepts would mean there would be strong tutorials, but the game turned out to be a painful reminder of my life-siphoning PIC microcontroller class. That said, it's certainly simpler and more engaging than working out problems with a breadboard and oscilloscope. The fact that I can even approach some of these problems has been an engineering confidence boost, although it also reveals just how far away I am from fully comprehending foundational electronics.Any game that comes with a datasheet as a tutorial is going to require a rare state of mind to excel in. Accomplishing anything in Shenzhen feels like a real achievement. Anyone with the fluency to comfortably approach the later assignments of the game would probably already have a job working for a company like Shenzhen and essentially be working overtime."],["So I spent 36 hours playing the solitaire mini-game, so i cant really speak to how good of a game it is.

Puzzles are highly replayable - you may optimize solutions for price, power usage etc. Extremely nostalgic if you ever programmed in assembly language.","One of the best puzzle games I've ever played.The thing I really appreciate about this game is the degree of difficulty. It's a tribute to how complex things have to be before they can be simple: of how much thought has to go into a plumbing system in order for you to not have to think about plumbing. The tasks the game asks you to perform are all conceptually simple to understand and would be easy to implement were it not for the parsimony of the instruction space in the puzzle system. The difficulty\/joy of this game is in understanding how to break these larger processes into multiple (very simple) stages, usually discarding \"elegance\" somewhere along the way. In any kind of modern high-level programming language the task of reversing a list is usually as simple as typing something like \"list.reverse()\" but in Shenzhen I\/O reversing a set of data requires foresight and planning. In Shenzhen I\/O your code paths are literal paths. Enormously recommended.","One of the most addictive solitaire games I have ever played attached to another great Zachtronics coding puzzle."],["This a addicting organization game.

So it is basically useless, and could be misleading.2. Test cases are the only inputs that you can use to guess what the problem is, but the test cases are very confusing too. For example, in the case of \"virtual reality buzzer\", you don't know why when the input is 1, the buzzer power on needs to go on and off in two consecutive cycles, and it is not clear whether it is possible that two 1s are input in two consecutive cycles.TLDR: if the designer wants to make a game out of embedded systems, they better make the issue description clear (doesn't have to be realistic). As an HW\/SW eng myself, looking at the test bench and guessing what the issue is is no fun and not correct.","6.1 hours into the game 0.1 actual game and 6 hours solitair.

There is no more linux. Everything is limited, and you have to puzzle just to kick out that extra cycle and hence power usage or do you kick out even more power with unrolled loops?But don't forget, you need to relax too.

The odds of finding this page aren't that high if you're not actively looking for it. You probably already know you want it.But in case you don't, this is a game where you program faux assembly. If that sounds fun, you're in the right place. It also has a fancy Solitaire-like game in it.It's kinda hard and the tutorial is a 40-ish page manual you bind yourself (the first page of which tells you how to assemble the manual), so if you're not too big on the manual thing, I'd suggest starting with Infinifactory or Opus Magnum.

It's an innovative game, and playing it is an informative experience."],["I think anyone like me who enjoys digital hardware hacking (Raspberry Pi etc.) and microcomputer architecture would enjoy this game. I'm definitely hooked. And you get some Chinese culture sprinkled in.","Read this first, then this game becomes a recommend. The below is technically spoilers, but man it shouldn't be. Basically, they strongly tell you to read the manual, but they omit commands in the manual (apparently they're in the Chinese manual). There's a command, called gen:gen P R\/I R\/ITranslates to:mov P 100slp R\/I # first R\/Imov P 0slp R\/I # second R\/IYeah, so it's basically a command that runs 4 commands as 1 command. It generates a pulse for a given duration then sets it to 0 for a given duration. When you just start the game, and you play a few puzzles and see your friends who've had this game solve it in way fewer commands with way less power and you bang your head against a wall for hours, this is why. They tell you to RTFM, then give you an incomplete manual.Apparently you learn these commands later via emails. So you can then go back and perfect your previous things because suddenly you have a new command. I sort of wish they didn't even include this command, as it's actually not needed; your program just gets longer. But if they include a command in the language, the manual (which they heavily stress that you should read), should include all commands.I'm mainly just frustrated at the hours I just spent trying to figure it out, but nothing I could have done would have made my solution shorter. It was literally impossible because they gave incomplete information.","Great logic puzzles and a very fun entry in micro controller programming","I see Solitaire, I like"],["Excellent game, a true mind bender."],["really works your brain, my head hurts after playing this because ive been thonking too hardbut also really fun, and helps with problem solving","Perfect for when you want to take a break from work by going to work.","yeah this definetly makes my brain tingle","This game provides a fun break from programming in high level languages.

I must say that it requires for you to learn a fair bit. You will not get a guide with every command being explained and showcased in an example. You'll need to read the manual to get it. I guess it just adds to the charm.","Shenzhen I\/O is another difficult puzzle programming game from Zachtronics.The story is you're hired as an engineer by a company to design products. Each level has an email from people within the company providing some background about the product you need to make. Upon completing a puzzle, a new email will be sent adding a little more to that story. You'll get to know the characters and their personalities a little better as the game goes along.This is easily the least accessible of the Zachtronics games I've played. Learning the basics is difficult, but once you know them, it's easy to play. One of the early emails provides you with the instruction manual which you are going to be required to read if you want to play this. The manual adds some immersion as it reads like a company printed document. It recommends printing it out and shows you how to put it together in a binder if you would like. I just grabbed a sheet of paper and wrote down all the basic commands along with examples of how they work and had it in front of me.The game consists of 31 levels plus some bonus levels once you finish the main campaign. Levels typically consist of input(s) and output(s). You're given basic information about what the program requirements are and can then click on the verification tab to get graphs showing what the inputs will be and what the expected outputs are. Part of the puzzles, especially later on, is that you need to be able to read the graphs of multiple inputs and outputs and interpret what's expected of you. You place computer chips on the board and then write your program to get the desired results. You're limited in the amount of space you have to place chips on the board, creating connections between those chips with inputs\/outputs\/other chips, and the number of lines of code each chip can execute. Basic $3 chips have 4 registers and hold up to 9 lines of code. The $5 chips take up more room but have 6 registers and can hold up to 14 lines of code. There are other chips you'll utilize to make your programs function.The first couple levels function as a sort of tutorial, only requiring the basic functions to finish. The first level has one chip filled in, showing you how to properly put commands into the chips. All you need to do is put the proper commands into the second chip and connect it to the output. The second level requires you to to take an input, multiply it by 2, and then output it. Things get more complicated from there on out. The levels are usually interesting as they have you making devices that you could find in real life. One level has you making a program that takes in coins of various values and then outputting the proper change. Another level has customers pressing a button on a sandwich vending machine and you need to create a program that makes a sandwich with the proper toppings. Some levels require you to refer to the manual for instructions on how a specific chip\/program will work.Upon completing a level, you're given totals on how well you did in 3 categories (production cost, power usage, and lines of code). You're then shown graphs of how well you did compared to everyone else who has played the game. If you have friends who played the game, their results are displayed in number form below the graphs showing who did better in each category. Part of the fun of the game is that once you've gotten better, you can go back to previous levels to optimize your solutions to compete with friends or to make yourself feel better about how you did compared to the rest of the world.Fairly early on, you're sent an email that contains a playable version of a solid variant of solitaire. You can freely play this over and over as much as you wish.The most difficult part of this game is probably figuring out how the registers (pins and xbuses) work. Each have their advantages and disadvantages. Pins can hold numbers from 0-100, will always remain on until you instruct them to turn off, can be read from multiple times without the number being used up, and can stay on without causing your program to error out. Xbuses can hold any number from -999 to 999, can only be read from one time before their number is used up, and a number that you output must be read by another chip\/output or it will cause your program to error out.Of the Zachtronics games I've played, I'd say the order of difficulty from least to most difficult goes: Opus Magnum, Infinifactory, Shenzhen I\/O, TIS-100, Spacechem. In terms of accessibility from least to most difficult to learn goes: Opus Magnum, Infinifactory, Spacechem, TIS-100, Shenzhen I\/O.Shenzhen I\/O, it's a really good puzzle programming game."],["one of the biggest thonks of my life. 10\/10.","A well-designed puzzle game, that helps the player develop an intuition for low level coding.
