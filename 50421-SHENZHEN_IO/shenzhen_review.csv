0,2704,I'm too stupid to play this game.
1,2704,"Extremely well-designed game! That solitaire achievement though, am I right?!"
2,2704,"Love it, fun game!"
3,2704,"Very challenging. I only took a Java 101 back then in the Uni. Only issue with this game is it lacks instruction. The textbook pdf has all the code language but not enough example. Also, as a bilingual person I sometimes need to switch back to English for more accurate instruction. But overall it is a good game. The mini-game is great, and has some room of improvement."
4,2704,Any game that makes you print out datasheets is an easy recommendation.
5,2703,i cant
6,2703,My brain hurts. At least there is that amazing solitaire game when you need a break. PROTIP: READ THE MANUAL. If you don't have another monitor to reference it definitely print it out. (Otherwise you won't get very far)
7,2702,I write assembly at work so I get paid to buy games that let me write assembly at home :/
8,2702,spent most of the time playing solitaire 10/10
9,2701,my head explode
10,2701,I think I've found this the hardest one out of all of Zachtronics games. Some puzzles took me several days to solve. Will really get that hamster inside your brain running!
11,2700,Fun programming puzzle game. With the emphasis on efficiency. Really gets your mind going.
12,2700,"Ingenious abstraction and simplification of a real world of embedded devices.So much suitable for children education.Definitely not for everyone, should have some basic knowledge about hardware and low-level programming to enjoy this game."
13,2699,"Best game ever, just. It's just like work, but without the soul crushing ambiguity."
14,2698,"Best puzzle game for any sort of engineer (even upcoming). It's a lot of fun trying to find the optimized solution, though also just as much fun seeing what sort of alternate variations you can come up with. The ""prototype"" areas act as a sandbox and really lets you run wild with ideas and experimenting.The use of a physical manual, the fake OS, and the emails all add an extra immersive level mixing realities together. You almost feel like you're doing the real thing going between the manual pages, emails, and the CAD software. Though I should add it's a lot more fun and rewarding than that sentence may initially lead you to believe haha.Even the included solitaire game is good. The extra card sets in addition to the ""usual"" solitaire gameplay offers more fun and thinking than the usual fair.Overall, a great puzzle game that not only gets you thinking, but actually teaches you some assembly language and even some circuitry too."
15,2698,"worth the money, a bit weird how it uses some assembly code but not really. felt a bit limited with jmp (ex: can't use jmp with offset or jne / jeq). wish the game could give the user a bit more freedom and maybe allow us to create parts."
16,2698,My favorite solitaire game ever. It also comes with some kind of programming mini-game attached. That's pretty good too.
17,2697,Good solitaire game.
18,2696,Good and addicting game.
19,2696,"like most zachtronics games, it's a little overpriced, but I think that is because there is little competition in this genre.  it's worth the sale price though"
20,2696,Have you taken a machine language programming class or aspire to take one? This game gives you something to do with that.
21,2695,"Not for everyone, but if you feel you may like this, then go for it"
22,2695,"The game is great, but you can't reset it and play it again, as Steam resynchs your progress from the cloud backup and there doesn't seem to be a good way to stop it. If it weren't for this, I'd give it a thumbs up."
23,2694,An interesting puzzle game with the veneer of software engineering. Electrical or Software Engineers may find it difficult to adjust to the unique control model and circuit design.
24,2694,learning...
25,2694,Good puzzles
26,2693,"Hmmm... just need to figure out this one thing and I'm done with the puzzle...OH WAIT, I can just do thi- nope...Oh actually, if I just do tha- hmm no...Wait, I just figured it out, it was so obvious, all I have to do is- nevermind..."
27,2693,"As always, a great Zachtronics game. My favorite of all the Zachtronic games I played, and on top of the zachtronic-like games as well. I like it more than Opus Magnum, SpaceChem or the strange hex thingy. I find it harder than the other ones as well."
28,2693,Bought this for the programming and just ended up playing 150 hours of solitaire instead.
29,2693,"A great puzzle game to remind myself that I am not that smart, and not good at puzzle games."
30,2693,Got this after playing a decent bit of TIS-100. The additional layout challenges + the more fluid UX makes me enjoy this even more than TIS-100.
31,2692,"If you are an electronics engineering student like me, this game is a great start. 10/10"
32,2692,It's a really joyful and meaningful game.
33,2692,Learning programming tricks can be fun
34,2692,You like programming? You like Zachtronics? You like ROBUST and SIMPLE code? Get this game.
35,2692,"amazing game, worth every dollar."
36,2691,Great game. The puzzles are enjoyable and can get somewhat frustrating toward the end.
37,2691,"yeah I just bought a raspberry pi yesterday, how could you tell?"
38,2691,Hahahahahhahahaahhahahahahahaha I wish I could go back to blissful ignorance when I didn't know about race conditions
39,2691,"Cool game -- though if you plan to 100% the achievements, be prepared to play a lot of solitaire."
40,2690,teq game good+ recommendslp 1
41,2690,100 % The best solitaire I have ever played.
42,2689,Assembly is fun :3
43,2688,simple enough if you take the time to read the booklet but complex enough to keep you busy and i have learnt a lot
44,2688,Absolutely
45,2688,"If you are an actual controls engineer, as I am, you will find the following too intensely frustration to enjoy this as a game in the long term: 1. Gimmicky and limited instruction set.2. Gimmicky and limited programming boxes. (arbitrarily limiting your lines of code, in a time when everything in the world has 1gb micro sd cards embedded on them now)3. Gimmicky and un-natural io points / mounting locations. Instead of designing things to have clean straight lines, and ease of interconnection, its so forced to have to snake stuff around in the limited boxes.I'm sure its a good and fun game, and I've had some limited fun, but I just don't recommend this if you are a real programmer - it is not enjoyable like real programming is."
46,2687,Procrastinate that difficult integrated circuit by playing solitaire in-game.Cry over the tiny space you have and your poor space management.Become frustrated when you see how poorly your circuit performs against others.This game is the Quintessential Engineer Experience.
47,2687,"I really wanted to give a negative review but this is what I opted in myself, like, I read the reviews and everything and I know what it's gonna be like and I still bought it...So I'm not gonna blame the game... Instead Ill just call myself an idiot."
48,2687,I love it 
49,2687,No idea what I'm doing but the struggle is fun.
50,2687,"not for the faint of heart. if you don't like reading documentation and experimenting, this game isn't for you. there's also at least one crucial piece of information that isn't included in ""the documentation"" thats needed to solve a particular puzzle, just FYI. I think it's somewhere in ""your emails""i enjoyed this, though i was very frustrated at some points, but i guess thats the nature of puzzle games"
51,2687,needs vim keys.5/5
52,2687,999/999 would nerd snipe again
53,2687,p. good
54,2687,Signed up for an assembly puzzle game but got distracted by solitaire instead.10/10 The puzzles are a great sidequest
55,2686,Good puzzle game if you like programming. It can be hard if you are not good at programming.
56,2685,"It's a must-have if even mildly interested in assembly style programming.Difficulty is high, but only if aiming for optimized solutions like those in the histogram. Otherwise, it's not very difficult."
57,2685,"Ahh, after a whole day of doing embedded system job, nothing beats the refreshing feeling of another embedded system job at home10/10 will make you wondering all day how tf does people designed machines that are way more optimized than yours"
58,2685,this game is super fun & requires critical thinking. 9/10 from me
59,2685,"oh no, im learning"
60,2684,"Awesome game if you like assembly and programming. Not for the faint of heart though, some puzzles get really difficult and take some time to work through. But it is an overall super fun experience and I'd buy it again in a heartbeat."
61,2684,"Recommended...with some caveats.Its a decent puzzle game, and if you're the sort who enjoys programming in your off time you'll probably get a kick out of it.As someone who's day job involves a lot of systems coding, I found the game sort of frustrating at times. Yes, its ""realistic"" in the sense that it (sort of) a lot like ""real"" assembly programming. But I found the limitations imparted to make it a puzzle, often more frustrating rather engaging.  In some ways its ""harder"" than the real world. Not in the actual problems, or even the solutions themselves, but in the super limited abilities of the various pieces. Which hey, if I didn't work in code day-in, day-out It wouldn't bother me as much. So tl;dr;. Fun programming logic and puzzle game, but wasn't exactly for me."
62,2684,great
63,2682,pretty cool
64,2682,"Definitely an accurate experience of how it is work with assembly.My only real problem with the game is that the documentation is absolute bollocks. Highly recommend traversing the internet's version of the documentation instead.Yes people, ""gen x x x"" is a command and you will fall in love with it."
65,2682,"Fun, gets harder towards the end, beyond my programming abilities. Read the manual or you will be utterly hopelessly lost.If you already have significant programming experiences you can solve the puzzles in a few minutes, but they all took me 30 min - 1 hour."
66,2681,This game is for engineers who don't have enough engineering to do.
67,2681,must play
68,2680,one of the biggest thonks of my life. 10/10.
69,2680,"A well-designed puzzle game, that helps the player develop an intuition for low level coding. Including documentation and spec documents with the various puzzles is a wonderful way to add flavour to the game."
70,2680,"If you're interested in a granular frame by frame approach to programming, then I think you may enjoy this, as it's a fun way to play with an abstraction of Assembly on micro circuits.  I found it to be challenging, and am still working through the later levels.Great buy."
71,2679,"I can't decide whether this ""game"" is being used to 1) Teach, 2) Challenge, or 3) Help the developers exploit the skills of gamers to help manufacturers make better products to compete with international competitors."
72,2679,A very interesting game for people interested in programming. I must say that it requires for you to learn a fair bit. You will not get a guide with every command being explained and showcased in an example. You'll need to read the manual to get it. I guess it just adds to the charm.
73,2679,"Shenzhen I/O is another difficult puzzle programming game from Zachtronics.The story is you're hired as an engineer by a company to design products. Each level has an email from people within the company providing some background about the product you need to make. Upon completing a puzzle, a new email will be sent adding a little more to that story. You'll get to know the characters and their personalities a little better as the game goes along.This is easily the least accessible of the Zachtronics games I've played. Learning the basics is difficult, but once you know them, it's easy to play. One of the early emails provides you with the instruction manual which you are going to be required to read if you want to play this. The manual adds some immersion as it reads like a company printed document. It recommends printing it out and shows you how to put it together in a binder if you would like. I just grabbed a sheet of paper and wrote down all the basic commands along with examples of how they work and had it in front of me.The game consists of 31 levels plus some bonus levels once you finish the main campaign. Levels typically consist of input(s) and output(s). You're given basic information about what the program requirements are and can then click on the verification tab to get graphs showing what the inputs will be and what the expected outputs are. Part of the puzzles, especially later on, is that you need to be able to read the graphs of multiple inputs and outputs and interpret what's expected of you. You place computer chips on the board and then write your program to get the desired results. You're limited in the amount of space you have to place chips on the board, creating connections between those chips with inputs/outputs/other chips, and the number of lines of code each chip can execute. Basic $3 chips have 4 registers and hold up to 9 lines of code. The $5 chips take up more room but have 6 registers and can hold up to 14 lines of code. There are other chips you'll utilize to make your programs function.The first couple levels function as a sort of tutorial, only requiring the basic functions to finish. The first level has one chip filled in, showing you how to properly put commands into the chips. All you need to do is put the proper commands into the second chip and connect it to the output. The second level requires you to to take an input, multiply it by 2, and then output it. Things get more complicated from there on out. The levels are usually interesting as they have you making devices that you could find in real life. One level has you making a program that takes in coins of various values and then outputting the proper change. Another level has customers pressing a button on a sandwich vending machine and you need to create a program that makes a sandwich with the proper toppings. Some levels require you to refer to the manual for instructions on how a specific chip/program will work.Upon completing a level, you're given totals on how well you did in 3 categories (production cost, power usage, and lines of code). You're then shown graphs of how well you did compared to everyone else who has played the game. If you have friends who played the game, their results are displayed in number form below the graphs showing who did better in each category. Part of the fun of the game is that once you've gotten better, you can go back to previous levels to optimize your solutions to compete with friends or to make yourself feel better about how you did compared to the rest of the world.Fairly early on, you're sent an email that contains a playable version of a solid variant of solitaire. You can freely play this over and over as much as you wish.The most difficult part of this game is probably figuring out how the registers (pins and xbuses) work. Each have their advantages and disadvantages. Pins can hold numbers from 0-100, will always remain on until you instruct them to turn off, can be read from multiple times without the number being used up, and can stay on without causing your program to error out. Xbuses can hold any number from -999 to 999, can only be read from one time before their number is used up, and a number that you output must be read by another chip/output or it will cause your program to error out.Of the Zachtronics games I've played, I'd say the order of difficulty from least to most difficult goes: Opus Magnum, Infinifactory, Shenzhen I/O, TIS-100, Spacechem. In terms of accessibility from least to most difficult to learn goes: Opus Magnum, Infinifactory, Spacechem, TIS-100, Shenzhen I/O.Shenzhen I/O, it's a really good puzzle programming game."
74,2678,"best solitaire game out there imoi like the assembly coding minigame it has tho, kinda distracts the purpose but still"
75,2678,Good Solitaire game 11/10
76,2677,"Yes, the programming part is fun, but what I loved most about this game is the theme and story. Opened my eyes about how the chinese gadgets we take for granted are pitched, designed and optimized."
77,2677,Gotta admit that I got lost in the first puzzle and didn't know what I was supposed to do.Takes some reading just to get started.Very good and addicting solitaire game.
78,2677,"Won't lie, the solitaire game in this is very good."
79,2676,"really works your brain, my head hurts after playing this because ive been thonking too hardbut also really fun, and helps with problem solving"
80,2676,Perfect for when you want to take a break from work by going to work.
81,2676,yeah this definetly makes my brain tingle
82,2676,This game provides a fun break from programming in high level languages. The backstory is amusing at times too. $16.32 well spent.
83,2676,"Feels like work, but fun!"
84,2675,"Excellent game, a true mind bender."
85,2674,I think anyone like me who enjoys digital hardware hacking (Raspberry Pi etc.) and microcomputer architecture would enjoy this game. I'm definitely hooked. And you get some Chinese culture sprinkled in.
86,2674,"Read this first, then this game becomes a recommend. The below is technically spoilers, but man it shouldn't be. Basically, they strongly tell you to read the manual, but they omit commands in the manual (apparently they're in the Chinese manual). There's a command, called gen:gen P R/I R/ITranslates to:mov P 100slp R/I # first R/Imov P 0slp R/I # second R/IYeah, so it's basically a command that runs 4 commands as 1 command. It generates a pulse for a given duration then sets it to 0 for a given duration. When you just start the game, and you play a few puzzles and see your friends who've had this game solve it in way fewer commands with way less power and you bang your head against a wall for hours, this is why. They tell you to RTFM, then give you an incomplete manual.Apparently you learn these commands later via emails. So you can then go back and perfect your previous things because suddenly you have a new command. I sort of wish they didn't even include this command, as it's actually not needed; your program just gets longer. But if they include a command in the language, the manual (which they heavily stress that you should read), should include all commands.I'm mainly just frustrated at the hours I just spent trying to figure it out, but nothing I could have done would have made my solution shorter. It was literally impossible because they gave incomplete information."
87,2674,Great logic puzzles and a very fun entry in micro controller programming
88,2674,"I see Solitaire, I like"
89,2673,I simply love this game!
90,2673,A very fun & cool little indie goldie for anyone enjoying both programming and games. Strongly recommend
91,2673,+
92,2673,"If you're trying to convince somebody that this game is great and they aren't immediately on board at the idea of printing the paper documents to put in a binder, they're probably not going to like it."
93,2673,"'A well-designed, casual solitaire game to kill time with many bonus contents, which are not quite necessary.'"
94,2673,"Great game, runs on Mac M1 without issue if anyone was wondering."
95,2673,"A lot of fun. It's an innovative game, and playing it is an informative experience."
96,2672,Excellent game.
97,2672,"my brain go hurtif you don't want your brain go hurt, i'd recommend opus magnum - probably my favorite Zachlike yet"
98,2671,"So after people told you that software based PWM on linux in userspace is stupid and can not be done, and you just have finished a product that animates several throbbing leds in software based PWM with nothing more than a lua script with enough cpu time to spare for the cpu not to kick into higher gear, nor the that does not kick in because it doesn't use enough power.When you did all that, it's time to relax, and start Shenzen I/O. There is no more linux. Everything is limited, and you have to puzzle just to kick out that extra cycle and hence power usage or do you kick out even more power with unrolled loops?But don't forget, you need to relax too. So if you have delivered your design, you can play some puzzles to relax a bit more.Shenzen I/O should be extremely interesting for those that were brought up with computing in the 70's and 80's."
99,2671,Good game
100,2671,"Good, challenging programming puzzles. Playing this game might be a good way to learn about efficiency in programming algorithms."
101,2671,"Guys, it's a Zachtronics game. The odds of finding this page aren't that high if you're not actively looking for it. You probably already know you want it.But in case you don't, this is a game where you program faux assembly. If that sounds fun, you're in the right place. It also has a fancy Solitaire-like game in it.It's kinda hard and the tutorial is a 40-ish page manual you bind yourself (the first page of which tells you how to assemble the manual), so if you're not too big on the manual thing, I'd suggest starting with Infinifactory or Opus Magnum. Similar vein of games, no manual needed."
102,2671,great game an fun coding challenges
103,2670,"If you like spending hours of your day trying to come up with a solution to these puzzles, this is the game for you."
104,2670,"There are two types of people: Those who like to play games to escape reality, experiencing a waterfall of rewards, and always looking for the next hit.And those who play games to put their brains through pain to come out the other end feeling proud of their hard-work and smarts."
105,2670,This is my favorite of the Zack games. It scratches the programming bug without feeling like I took on a third job.
106,2670,"This game requires you to use your monkey brain, and it is hard. People joke that it's ""work simulator"" and they're not wrong, but if you're like me and you love solving open-ended logic puzzles you will like this."
107,2670,Super challenging and doesn't hold your hand. Read the damn manual.
108,2670,Assembly Simulator
109,2670,Im not smart enough for this game
110,2670,this game is hard
111,2670,Gave me ptsd flashbacks to assembly homework from one of my college CS classes.
112,2670,It's a good way to get into coding.
113,2670,"Awesome solitaire simulator, supposedly it has some assembly language puzzles on the side as well but I wouldn't know anything about that."
114,2669,"expected much more. poor documentation, boring quests."
115,2669,"It's like TIS-100, but EVEN MORE.And it comes with a way to slack off from virtual work that is also really compelling."
116,2669,It's like the incredible machine for people who want their brain to hurt. Also they made me pay money for solitaire. I'm enjoying it
117,2669,"1. The information provided by the problem description is very vague, and sometimes even conflicting with the test cases. So it is basically useless, and could be misleading.2. Test cases are the only inputs that you can use to guess what the problem is, but the test cases are very confusing too. For example, in the case of ""virtual reality buzzer"", you don't know why when the input is 1, the buzzer power on needs to go on and off in two consecutive cycles, and it is not clear whether it is possible that two 1s are input in two consecutive cycles.TLDR: if the designer wants to make a game out of embedded systems, they better make the issue description clear (doesn't have to be realistic). As an HW/SW eng myself, looking at the test bench and guessing what the issue is is no fun and not correct."
118,2669,6.1 hours into the game 0.1 actual game and 6 hours solitair. Nice!
119,2669,damn i'm so stressed out by coding let me cool off with coding
120,2669,"Pretty fun puzzles, especially for someone who likes coding."
121,2668,This a addicting organization game. With limited assembler like commands you solve interesting problems for automata. Very cool!
122,2668,Very challenging and fun.
123,2668,Teaches you Assembler programming
124,2668,"I like it, only played for 5 hours but i think its very good."
125,2668,Frustrating and totally worth learning
126,2667,"Zachtronics never fails to impress!  This game trains you to think like a software engineer, and solving the challenging puzzles is extremely rewarding.  The music is great too!"
127,2667,embodies the fun parts of assembly programming
128,2667,:D
129,2667,"Really difficult game, but fun."
130,2667,Best solitaire sim on steam
131,2667,please add more parts to the gameplease
132,2667,remind me to play this game 4 year later when i finish my electrical engineering degree
133,2667,Solitaire is great
134,2667,"Quite challenging. Puzzles are highly replayable - you may optimize solutions for price, power usage etc. Extremely nostalgic if you ever programmed in assembly language."
135,2667,"One of the best puzzle games I've ever played.The thing I really appreciate about this game is the degree of difficulty. It's a tribute to how complex things have to be before they can be simple: of how much thought has to go into a plumbing system in order for you to not have to think about plumbing. The tasks the game asks you to perform are all conceptually simple to understand and would be easy to implement were it not for the parsimony of the instruction space in the puzzle system. The difficulty/joy of this game is in understanding how to break these larger processes into multiple (very simple) stages, usually discarding ""elegance"" somewhere along the way. In any kind of modern high-level programming language the task of reversing a list is usually as simple as typing something like ""list.reverse()"" but in Shenzhen I/O reversing a set of data requires foresight and planning. In Shenzhen I/O your code paths are literal paths. Enormously recommended."
136,2667,One of the most addictive solitaire games I have ever played attached to another great Zachtronics coding puzzle.
137,2666,"So I spent 36 hours playing the solitaire mini-game, so i cant really speak to how good of a game it is. However, the 20 or so minutes I played of the actual game were okay."
138,2666,I played space chem a while back and I liked it however I enjoyed this game a lot more! It feels like two thirds coding/problem solving and one third puzzle space management. Also a really subtle mysterious story throughout the game.
139,2666,"If you like coding and have a great mind, this puzzle for you!"
140,2666,"fun programming puzzles. the NPCs are also enjoyable. if you like the ""paper manual"" aspect of Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes, then look forward to experiencing that again."
141,2666,assembly good javascript bad
142,2666,"This game is fantastic! I'm thoroughly enjoying all the puzzles so far, the learning curve is not too steep, yet still presents a good challenge. The UI is very easy to use and looks very clean, which further elevated my experience. 10/10 would recommend this game to anybody who loves problem solving."
143,2665,"A masterpiece in its own subgenre of puzzles.The only bad things i can say about the game is that the manual lacks instruction set examples which are critical for noobs and that the avalon puzzles' specifications are too poorly explained. (they literally ask the player to figure it out by themselves by reading the verification, which is a big no no considering every puzzle before were concise in what it asked the player to do.)"
144,2665,"Love it! Kinda like exapunks but with a great electrical engineering touch, and very similar to how real world digital logic works."
145,2665,This game gives you homework and will fail you if you don't love it.
146,2665,Learned more in my first hour than I did in a 200-level CS class. A seriously great game.
147,2665,Good
148,2665,It's like learning to code with your feet and hands tied behind your back and you're thrown in a swimming pool. Also it has solitaire.
149,2665,"Definitely one of the harder Zach-Like puzzles.  Contrary to some other reviews, you need no experience with real-life electrical engineering to play, I do embedded hardware design IRL and this is substantially different.  I would recommend some very basic programming knowledge, although a bright player should be able to pick it up quickly.  READ THE MANUAL."
150,2665,Love it so far!
151,2665,This triggers so much of my uni engineering course PTSD
152,2665,It's a good game for people already familiar with coding. Also this game doesn't hold your hand. You literally have to figure  everything yourself.
153,2665,"I looked into Shenzhen I/O assuming that the gamification of its high-level concepts would mean there would be strong tutorials, but the game turned out to be a painful reminder of my life-siphoning PIC microcontroller class. That said, it's certainly simpler and more engaging than working out problems with a breadboard and oscilloscope. The fact that I can even approach some of these problems has been an engineering confidence boost, although it also reveals just how far away I am from fully comprehending foundational electronics.Any game that comes with a datasheet as a tutorial is going to require a rare state of mind to excel in. Accomplishing anything in Shenzhen feels like a real achievement. Anyone with the fluency to comfortably approach the later assignments of the game would probably already have a job working for a company like Shenzhen and essentially be working overtime."
154,2664,This game is a great thing to focus on while I ignore my engineering lectures.
155,2664,half of my hours are probably in solitaire
156,2664,"if you dont have any experience programming, dont get this.you could learn how to program but i think it'll be quicker to just do some python, this will require you to think more outside of the box than thatbut if you have a decent amount of experience, this might be a fun way to do some projects in assembly"
157,2664,The puzzles are really great and best enjoyed if you already know a bit of programming. The solitaire game included is also pretty great and also fun & challenging.
158,2664,"Programming's boring. It's always ""ooOoOHH mAkE tHe cOdE rEaDaBLe""... which is good advice, but damn premature optimizaton is so FUN. And this is basically premature optimization the game. So get it all out out of your system here, and when you go back to work write the long safe code."
159,2664,"1) DO NOT buy this game if you're really not into programming. Or at least solitaire. I saw a couple of people complaining online that its impossible to play without basic assembler knowledge and yes, it pretty much is (unless you're really motivated).2) DO NOT check stuff online while playing it. In attempt to see how much I could optimize the first task, I spoiled myself an undocumented command.It only took a couple of reviews and, as a programmer, I immediately knew that I had to have it. First day and about 8 hours in one sitting.In my free time I usually think of programming tasks and complete them, but this game allowed me to both emerge into its story (yep it has a story!!!) and its own programming constraints. The game has no tutorial, it rather gives you a 47-page PDF file which is both amazing and sometimes even funny, written in true fashion of actual hardware and microprocessor specifications.The tasks are demanding but nothing feels better than seeing yourself at the top of the chart when you're done. So far I'm absoultely enjoying it. But I'll never disrespect an integer variable again in my life."
160,2664,You probably have to have some interest in programming and/or electronics to enjoy this game.  I do and I love it so far!  The card game is fun too.
161,2664,This game has it pros and cons.  In the long run I don't recommend it.  The basic gist of the game is to place electron components then program the micro-controllers for the desired outputs based on a simulated set of inputs.  All well and good except they don't base anything on real world micro-controllers.  They use base10 instead of binary or hexadecimal.  They restrict you to 9 or 14 lines of programming code.  I don't know of a single real world micro-controller that is that restrictive.  The only pro I can say about this game is I love the mini solitaire game they included as a mini game.  BTW: I've programmed PIC micro-controllers and done a bit with SBCs (Arduino and Raspberry Pi).  In the long run this game was just way to restrictive on the coding.  Go get Opus Magnum instead.  I fully enjoyed that one since my only real restriction was the inputs and outputs.
162,2664,"Come for the assembly programming, stay for the solitaire."
166,2664,"looked cool, figured id give it a try. Got given no tutorial just a manual and after staying up all night solving problems my head feels worse than a hangover but all in all was great fun. If you enjoy challenging puzzles and getting so close yet failing to being read/write locked over and over its worth the price."
167,2664,Why am I so bad at solitaire
168,2664,"This is one of two games I play after a bad meeting or bad day at work (I am a systems engineer as of writing this). The second being the Kerbal Space Program. This game makes me feel smart and happy. I don't need to call meetings to tell people that they are dumb; I don't need to explain to my project manager why I can't do 8+ experiments that take 8.5 days each and report back in a week. Basically, it is a game that makes me feel good about my life choices."
169,2664,great coding practice
170,2664,probably the most polished and fun zachtronics game. really good stuff
171,2664,..I think I'm starting to regret my career choice.
172,2664,I used to play games when I took a break from my CS classes.Now I study when I take a break from this.
173,2664,"Very good game, excellent polish.  The programming and engineering puzzles start off relatively easy, but quickly become complex and challenging.  It is one of the best of it's kind, but beating the puzzles requires quite a bit of thinking and tinkering in higher levels.  Very satisfying, if a solution is found.  And it can be compared to others with the chance of trying muliple approaches on the same puzzle optimizing the own way of completing a puzzle.  For newcomers without programming knowledge I would recommend to try Opus Magnum first, for people with at least basic knowledge about programming I would recommend Exapunks first.  Opus Magnum requires creative thinking and coordinating processes, which is also needed in the other games.  Exapunks I found a little bit easier due to lack of restriction to the number of usable programming lines per item. Please take my assessment with a grain of salt, as I have not finished either of these games yet.  But I find this assessment ringing true with other gamers enjoying Zachtronics titles.Edit:  The great Shenzhen Solitaire is also available on Steam without the main coding game."
181,2664,Really makes you feeeel like an electrical engineer working a 9-5 job in China
182,2664,"good puzzles, and amusing backstory... has some weird basis in real life"
186,2664,"This is a strange game. It feels like it's a hard way to learn how to code, meanwhile the purpose of the game is to teach you concepts in CS that relate to assembly. I also have no idea why solitaire is added, you code in assembly, then play solitaire for whatever reason, that's the game. Worth it for 5$ and I plan on playing it more and following it in the future."
187,2664,Engineering is buck nasty.
188,2664,never thought of programming simulator XD very good game if you wanna start learning the art of programming from ground
189,2664,To quote the first level in the game:  mov 0 p0  slp 6  mov 100 p0  slp 6 # why is this# so hard? :(
190,2664,"I am a computer science major, I knew what I would have been getting into when I bought it. I opened it, opened the manual then my brain melted. Honestly if I had more willpower I could do it, but I don't.10/10"
191,2664,I've always been curious about this game but I have never bothered to try or look into it.  I bought it today on sale and to my surprise it was not what I first expected. The game throws a 50 page manual in your face and tells you to go to town. Very interesting idea for a game and a new experience apart from the hundreds of games that I have played over the years. There is nothing else like this. This game is the perfect game for someone interested in computer science/ engineering like myself. I look forward to playing more.
193,2664,"assembler (low level) code programming with a story telling.Definitely worth to play if you like robotics, cyber techs or want to know how is it works exactly"
200,2664,based and solitairepilled
201,2664,good
202,2664,"i bought this under the impression this was going to be a light coding game that would talk you through the basics and then gradually get more complex...I was wrong!This game has no tutorial, just a manual that requires memorising/studying. By no means take this as a bad review, i just hadn't realised what i signed up for. If this seems like your kind of game i wish you the best of luck."
203,2664,"This game rocks. Potentially the best game I've ever played. Don't approach this as ""this will teach me proper programming"" or ""this will teach electrical engineering"", it does these things to a very small degree, but at a conceptual level. If you love Youtuber Ben Eater and his computer wiring projects, this game is for you. this is not a ""quick"" game, it will require some study of the 50 page manual (available ingame and online). It requires an inquisitive mind. The game mentioned computer registers, so before I knew it, I had spent 90 minutes on wikipedia reading about all the details how computer registers and accumulators really work. So wonderfully stimulating. I wish that the  ""on"" was set at a value of 1 instead of 100 and ""off"" at 0 but oh well. Who knows what units of voltage are used. The puzzles are very fun, the UI is super fun. It looks like how your computer screen would look if you worked for the great Longteng corporation. Believe it or not, there is a nice immersion element to the game. The people who email you feel quite real. Music is excellent. I printed out ""The Manual"" to get that real tactile feel in a 3 ring binder.  I can already tell this game will take many of my hours. The manual feels *very very* real. I remember having to wire Chinese manufactured sensor modules in graduate school, and having to pour over pdfs *just* like the manual ingame. For my friends in the solitaire community; The solitaire game is absolutely wonderful and enjoyable. *Super* addictive version of solitaire and somewhat more difficult.I was told by several people that this is Zachtronics best. I love this game.EDIT: Played additional 10-20 hours and game is even better. Now no longer happy with correct solutions to diagrams...we need low voltage usage and lowest production cost.Best $15 ever spent game-wise. Found Youtube videos of people wiring tetris ingame...amazing.."
204,2663,"Best solitaire game ever (I think there is some other game attached to it but I don't know about that, looks complicated)"
205,2663,always enjoyed super low level programming games. This one is really cool because you also get to put together circuit boards. Has a good variety of levels and different parts to interact with.Would also recommend 7 billion humans + the other game by them if you like this one
206,2663,"A lot like TIS-100, but with more flexibility... and also some different limitations. Lots of signal processing. Takes the ""read the manual"" aspects of TIS-100 and expands on them. Lots of fun. I wish there were more games like this. Highly recommended."
207,2663,"First thing first: this game probably isn't for you if you aren't technically inclined. You will be reading datasheets, using logic gates, and of course, writing code in a surprisingly devious form of assembly.If you can withstand the technical nature of this, it is incredible. Zachtronics has really mastered the art of producing difficult puzzles that don't have a single correct solution. Instead, you get to optimize your solution on three criteria: cost (dictated by which components you use), power consumption (given by the amount of time your embedded system spends running code vs operating in sleep mode), and lines of code. Best of all, each solved puzzle grants you a histogram of user solutions for each criterion. This is great for allowing the player to adjust their difficulty. For instance, I have been focusing on reducing the number of components (it is what feels right as an electrical engineer). As such, my challenge becomes finding out how to use the hardware I do include to its fullest. I am sure that I could make my life even more complex by paying attention to power consumption and the number of lines of code, but I am happy with my current level of difficulty.In the past I tried to get started with TIS-1000, but I found it too dense. However, I think that this game does a good job of blending the main challenge of writing assembly with the challenge of selecting and placing components onto the PCB, something that I certainly appreciate. Who knows, once I finish this game I might be able to tackle TIS-1000!"
208,2663,I enjoy it.  Unrealistic in some places.  But that is okay.  Games don't need realism; they only need fun.
209,2663,"Some of the puzzles are absurdly difficult. I didn't get to the end, because I reached the limit of my patience and/or ability.  That's OK, I got my money's worth out of this game."
210,2662,"The game is fun as hell, but nowadays I really just come here for the solitaire when VALORANT gets boring. 11/10, 2016 GOTY."
211,2662,Thank you for making it so easy for me to procrastinate inside of a video game.
212,2662,"I consider a puzzle game to be great if I can continue to think about or dream about problems long after I put down the keyboard. This is an example of one such game. If you enjoy this and have not already, definitely check out TIS-100 and Exapunks."
213,2662,If you are into programming micro controllers this game is definitely for you!
214,2662,10/10 helped me learn assembly
215,2661,"It's literally programming.It's programming.It's like pybat with a nice interface and steam achievements. Oh yeah, the language is a made-up assembly language.I swear to God I spent more time playing the solitaire minigame than actually playing the game."
216,2661,"If you love solving puzzles and writing code, this game is going to tickle your brain like none other."
217,2661,"came for the circuit design, stayed for the solitaire"
218,2661,I started my career in technology as an embedded firmware engineer. I am not a technical contributor anymore and long for the fun parts of my old job: the endless puzzles. This game scratches that itch and more. I love it.
219,2661,It's too hard for me eventhough i've been programming with C# and C++ for more than a decade. It's boring to have to use workthrough guides to be able to progress in the game.
220,2661,Drains your printer ink then drains your ability to think straight
221,2661,"The traditional cop-out review: if you like programming games, you'll like Shenzhen I/O. A lot of Zachtronics Games output seems to iterate on ideas, and in this case, Shenzhen I/O feels like an iterative improvement on the mechanics of TIS-100 - in both cases, the challenge is solving challenges with networks of limited-capacity processors, rather than monolithic solutions. Also, there's an excellent Solitaire variant that at about 50% of my playtime was spent on..."
222,2661,Nice game for people who like programming. Not to hard and easy going.
223,2661, this game. I love it!
224,2661,"Jogo, maaaas, como no programo  DIFICIL PRA PORRA MERMO kkkkkmas vale a pena, melhor maneira de matar o tempo"
225,2660,"come for the coding, stay for the solitaire"
226,2660,"5 hours making circuits and stuff, 100+hours playing Solitaire. @1500 wins at the time of writing. ezClap"
227,2660,"Good game for programmers, both if you're well versed in assembly, or you just dabble, or want to learn more.The puzzles do a good job of presenting realistic and interesting jobs that show up in the real world so you aren't just programming another divide algorithm for the 100th time. The MCUs are also pretty good at balancing real world and fun. The PDF material was a good touch too, and the realism and attention to detail shines very brightly. I could have swapped it with a real datasheet and no one would notice.The multiple campaigns are good at providing closure without crushing you, or leaving it open to tackle some much harder puzzles.Really no complaints here at all. Thanks for the Linux port!"
228,2660,Great game to learn basic ASM
229,2660,"An excellent Zachtronics title, perhaps the most zachtronicy of all the games published so far. This one has plenty of great, hard puzzles and a good narrative to tie them all together. The tools you're given to solve the puzzles give you a ton of room for creativity, but also heavily constrict you. It's most similar to Exapunks and TIS-100 in that it's a true programming (as in coding) game. Probably a step harder than Exapunks but a step easier than TIS-100. If you haven't played other Zachtronics games I'd probably steer you towards Exapunks only because of the difficulty of this game, but if that's not a concern Shenzhen I/O is really one of the best puzzle games I've played. It's relentlessly challenging, innovative, and allows for a surprising breadth of creativity. Plus the solitaire minigame is very good too :)"
230,2660,spending my time away from work still working
231,2660,nice solitaire game
232,2660,I only play solitaire
233,2659,"I enjoyed both infinifactory and TIS-100, but Shenzhen I/O is just too much all at once.  5-6 levels in, you unlock a sandbox level where you can use all the parts, and the fluff text tells you to try building a video game. And apparently, if you're not up to the task of building a working game of some kind right there after the first few levels of this game playing with deliberately unhelpful microcontroller parts, maybe put your pacifier back in and  back off to Mario.Look I'm  sorry, okay?"
234,2659,this game is for me but it may not be for you
235,2659,"When you are just bored and wanted to do some programming/exercise your brain, this is the game."
236,2659,"MOAR BELTS, MOAR MAGAZINES!"
237,2658,this game makes my brain hurt in frustration.I like it
238,2658,Makes my brain hurtin a good way. Solidly recommended
239,2657,"fun, but better if you know programming first"
240,2657,"As an Electrical Engineering student, I can confirm this satisfies the itch for digital design without the headache of working with hardware description languages."
241,2656,Why am I still at work at home?
242,2656,Can't say I've had the privilege of playing a game that came with a literal manual :D 10/10 Would Pog over assembly again
243,2656,"I dont really have had much internet lately and thus couldn't have asked for a better way to stimulate my brain, highly recommend Molek-Syntez both 10/10"
244,2656,"As someone who writes Python at work relatively often, and who enjoys logic puzzles and min-maxing games, I was really expecting to enjoy this game. Unfortunately, this quickly devolves into a ""Worst Parts of Coding Simulator.""1. Terrible Documentation.The documentation for the pseudo coding language is terrible. There is no organization to it. The keyword definitions are strewn throughout the 40 page booklet. This means you have to somehow save multiple random spots in the booklet in order to explore your options. One section of the keywords is just a tiny box in the corner, on a page about something else, completely out of context. Yuck.The documentation for the hardware is even worse. They simply don't define the rules for Xbus enough.  They don't talk about how micro processors that receive xbus are not allowed to sleep after catching the xbus input. This makes no sense, as the only way to advance time is to sleep. You can definitely sleep in 2 different micro processors if you use a p input.2. Extremely Destructive WorkflowYou are not allowed to have microprocessors on the worktable unless 1) they are hooked up to the circuit and 2) they have no syntax errors. This means that you can't have a couple of good chips written and on the side, and try swapping in your different solutions as you brainstorm. You only get one idea at a time. This is particularly infuriating because there is a clearly delineated ""active area"" and ""inactive area"" of the work table. You should definitely be able to put extraneous processors in the inactive area and run the program.3. Comments Not AllowedAlthough comments are implemented, you have, like, 24 characters available in each line. And you have so few lines of code in each micro chip that using one up just for a comment is both idiotic and impossible, because you need it for actual code. You will have no ROOM to put comments in. This makes remembering what your weird-ass assembly code constructions do really hard to remember, especially because of the other limitations of the language forcing you to do very awkward flow-control.4. Archaic Error MessagingThe error messages are so vague. It points at one line of code while complaining about a different component not sleeping.If you add a sleep to the only other component it could be talking about, it complains about sleeping on that line instead. This is just one example of seemingly inane and actively unhelpful error messages.Result:As the puzzles get harder, these annoyances become greatly magnified. Its all the parts I hate most about programming rolled up into a very tight package with literally no point to my suffering because this is a fake language in a fake game. All I do is spend my time feeling frustrated about problems that the game doesn't help me solve, even though I know which problems are holding me back. It becomes a struggle against the illogical results of the mechanics, and having no clear avenue for learning ""WHY"" such a strange thing is happening instead of a struggle against knowable mechanics and a continual learning process. I do this for work. I have no idea why you'd want to do it for fun.You need to be totally in love with programming in order to enjoy this game. I should've picked Opus Magnum or EXA Punks."
245,2656,"Wow, didn't expect it to be that good.I have never written any assembly programs in my whole career, this game makes the assembler language entry point so smooth and soft, like a nice role of premium toilet paper.Enjoy !"
246,2656,I like to relax after a long day working as a programmer by pretending to be a programmer
247,2656,"Amazing game. Really fun, great puzzles. Only play if you have basic knowledge of how computers work and logic, as some of the puzzles are very challenging."
248,2656,"RTFM, mate!  Assembly & circuits!"
249,2656,"A game that feels like work, but not in a bad way."
250,2656,Great puzzle/logic game. As you learn new skills you can go back to previous puzzles and implement them.Highly recommend
251,2655,"One of the best educational games on Steam. You can tinker with hardware, without having to buy a IoT platform like Arduino. The built in assembler language is not too complicated. As a Software Engineer, I enjoy playing this game in my spare time, although it almost feels like a second job."
252,2655,Really fun game for folks who are learning or work with ASM!
253,2655,"Excellent solitaire game. Might also have a programming puzzle game in it, I wouldn't know."
254,2654,a great offering in line with zactronics other computer-centric puzzle games
255,2654,"Fun game, good puzzles, very clean UI."
256,2654,"I agree with another comment I heard.  Electrical Engineering the video game.  Very well designed, and easy to pick up.  the ""programming language"" they use in game is fairly basic, but also similar enough to actual programming that the skill transfers over. Also includes a mini solitaire game which is pretty fun."
257,2653,This is a great game for just writing some assembly
258,2653,Been playing this instead of studying for my actual cs final. I dont regret it :D
259,2653,It's fun
260,2652,"If you dont use all the space on the circuit board you're being wasteful - me with 9  MC6000stop tier game though, print out the manual."
261,2652,"This game following up the same assembly language puzzle game like TIS-100, only now you also got electronic logic added on top of it.It does complicate the game somewhat, but it also make it easier to seperate puzzles into each own container.Contrary to what some reviewers has said, you will learn how to do very basic assembly with this game, but of course you won't be fluent in assembly because of it."
262,2652,Really good and almost realistic. Playing this may actually generate the interest in micro-controller based systems and programming.
263,2652,"Well designed, challenging puzzles"
264,2652,Another awesome game from Zachtromics
265,2651,This game is really hard but its a great feeling when you win.
266,2651,Tons of fun and challenge! Great variety.
267,2651,A surprisingly fun game despite being similar to an embedded system engineer's work life. Just like in real life I end up playing more solitaire than doing actual work.
268,2651,"A great game for any programmer.So far it's been nicely contained and challenging little projects with lots of room for optimization.The solitaire is fun, too. =D"
269,2650,I print and put manuals in hardcover folder.That's my passion for this game.
270,2650,"just learning how to play this puzzle game is rewarding in its own right. Then, once you grasp the mechanics it really opens up."
271,2650,The game creates a funny atmosphere and the hardware puzzles you have to solve are funny and challenging.
272,2650,Really fun game when I want to chill out and do a little programming without it having a worky sort of taste
273,2649,"Great game if you like programming. Starts very easy but gets more and more demanding. The language is simple and easy to learn yet powerful enough. Even if you solved every single puzzle it's still challenging to reduce the number of lines of code, the costs and the power consumption. Great puzzle game. Highly recommended."
274,2649,Very good solitaire
275,2649,Challenging but very satisfying
276,2647,Great solitaire game with a fun little programming minigame on the side.
277,2647,"Less of a puzzle game, more of a workplace simulator. You are a young electrical engineer thrust into a coding environment with only a stack of data sheets and a few vague tips on how to complete the task. Nostalgia abounds as you rifle through a printed stack of notes to find snippets of information that will help you crack the latest challenge. The puzzles are very well chosen, and are tough enough to give you the buzz of working out a difficult challenge, but the limited code lines mean that this is more about being efficient than producing long, complex code that most modern programmers would have become accustomed to. As usual there's a bit of a backstory that helps sell the immersion, and another brilliant Zachtronics minigame in its take on a mahjong solitaire.  For those who remember, this is a throwback to writing code on extremely limited PIC microcontrollers, trying to create something under crazy small limits of total lines of code. It's very rare that this old artform is called into use these days, given the insane power in modern chips. It will remind you quite thoroughly of how good we have it now, but there is something beautiful about working withing very tight constraints. Definitely one of the more difficult of Zachtronic's games, the lack of physical elements as found in opus magnum and space chem, combined with a focus on hyper efficient programs makes debugging a little more difficult. The limitations mean that you're unlikely to brute force your way through too many puzzles."
278,2647,"It is pretty much just my normal job, but with more solitaire. The game is a mix of being a hardware and a software engineer. I would put this in the same realm of controls engineering, but instead of having a PLC with a proprietary language you are just using a flavor of basic."
279,2646,"I picked this game up on a whim and was transported back to my youth where I sat at the soldering bench, stack of datasheets and reference diagrams from sketchy chip providers in hand, flashing PIC MCUs and teaching myself microelectronics.  Highly recommended, even if you're not EE-inclined."
280,2646,"Amazing game so far; completing the circuit designs is half the battle, the other half is optimizing them (in particular to cost). It is a game about Engineers (Software Engineers/Electrical Engineers) for Engineers."
281,2645,11 lines of code out of 10
282,2645,"I mean, if you like signal problems and playing with microcontroller logic"
283,2645,"Great game, an interesting challenge. Sometimes feels a bit like hard work, but then you can always enjoy slacking off from your fake job with a game of cards!"
284,2645,"dont like idea of needing to print manual for reference during game, but feel that was cool option. Like old days when computer games came with a paper manual in the box. lolI personally got tired of trying to 'win solitaire game' when cards fall in a way that makes hand unwinnable. be better if it was catered to level of game play. ie. easy play can win solitaire 1 out of 5, hard win 1 out of 35 ?the rest of the game is tolerable on easy so far.  Looking forward to playing more later."
285,2645,Incredible.
286,2644,pain
287,2644,Documentations is missing key operations and explanations. Both game and documentation does nothing for a new player not experienced with coding. Would rather code Java than this sh*t.
288,2644,EXCELLENTthe perfect sequel of TIS-100
289,2644,"Solving the puzzles at all is an enjoyable challenge that most will be able to accomplish with some time investment. Optimising them in comparison to the leaderboard can take me hours or days, and sometimes I don't manage to hit the best-possible on each metric, but it's very satisfying when you do -- it usually involves truly creative uses of the hardware's (sometimes undocumented!) behaviour."
290,2643,"Game provides documentation which is incomplete, many early problems are made trivial with operations not included in documentation, poor game design, should not falsely add complexity by providing poor or misleading instructions."
291,2642,"This game is awesome. True corporation. Internal assembly language with not complete, partially Chinese documentation. Would recommend. 10/10"
292,2642,"Truly OUTSTANDING!  This rates, like TS-100, 10/10 stars.  Excellent job!"
293,2642,"Another fantastic Zachtronics game.   Same great puzzle solving, and pseudo assembly-language programming.  Could not recommend more highly for future programmers!"
294,2641,"Imagine working at an engineering firm that's together enough that they don't change the specs while you're working on a project. That's the fantasy that this game provides, and it's a powerful one."
295,2641,"As a developer, its a great game for thinking algorithms"
296,2641,"Top notch puzzles from Zachtronics, as always + I love all the stories, ad emails, and character development they put in the game"
297,2641,It's good
298,2640,"Fun puzzle game where you have to connect components on a board and control them using an assembly programming language. The best part is that a lot of the puzzles use custom components that you learn to interface with only for that specific level which keeps it fresh, unlike some similar games where you basically have all the same tools from the start of the game. For a puzzle/coding game, it has a surprisingly immersive story with some funny characters in it.This would be a great way to start learning real life assembly programming, and if you already know how to do that (or higher level coding) then you will probably really enjoy this game. In general, it's paced well so you will learn progressively more complicated techniques. The one game mechanic that really confused me for a while was the two different types of data transfer (simple I/O and xBus). They have totally different rules and you'll often need to use both."
299,2640,A game I digitally purchased made me print out it's manual for reference.
300,2640,"A game where you solve problem by designing a circuit with a microcontroller in the middle that you program with assembly (sort of) language. If your into electronics or programming, this is a must in my opinion.Also solitaire mini game is really good."
301,2639,Not recommended for those without foundation of assembly language.
302,2639,"Difficult, but not a bad way to learn a little about coding and hardware."
303,2639,Enjoyable.
304,2639,Love it.
305,2639,"I spend hours writing code and optimizing it as much as possible. And then after work I'll open Shenzhen I/O and spend hours writing code and optimizing it as much as possible. My friends often joke that it seems more like working a second job than playing a game. While that may be true, it is fun nevertheless."
306,2639,"IC programming-esque puzzles, what's not to like. The in-game solitaire is quite satisfying too. Looking forward to playing more."
307,2639,"Fun and challenging programming puzzle game in a rare genre that lets you feel like a badass assembly programmer without actually sucking your soul through your face like real assembly might. The best part is that every puzzle has you deciding whether you want to build solutions that optimize one of execution speed, production cost, or memory (total code lines) which means each puzzle will have multiple solution that you can replay and find."
308,2639,other than the fact that my brain feels like its melting every time i play it its really fun
309,2638,big brain game
310,2638,"Great solitaire game, though with 3 suits instead of 4. The game also has a fun side mode where you write assembly code in small boxes."
311,2638,Fun game!
312,2638,Absolutely brilliant!
313,2638,Juegazo!
314,2638,It helps you cry: Open a question. Feel the pain. RTFM. Curse the line limitations. Finish a spaghetti while crying. Search the Internet for better answers and cry more. Go to next one. Rinse and repeat.*For robots and programmers: You don't cry. You're ruining the scene.
315,2638,Game created by engineer for engineers :>
316,2638,"One of the most fun games I've ever played. The language is quirky and a bit limiting which can sometimes be frustrating, but overall makes the problems more challenging and therefore more fun."
317,2637,"Challenging puzzles (sometimes too hard for me!), but rewarding once its done. Recommended for puzzle and coding enthusiasts."
318,2637,"If you are into code golf, you will love this!This game is like a series of code golf challenges but the source code size is not the only thing that you are forced to optimize for in this game. Some other things that make this game MORE FUN than a typical code golf challenge:- Very limited instruction set.- Very limited number of lines of code (LOC) can fit on a single microcontroller.- Extremely limited number of registers per microcontroller.- Want to have more registers or more LOC in your solution? Add another microcontroller to the board! But this will increase the cost of the design... And it is possible that it will not fit on the board at all... (after all, you are working on embedded systems) Or if it does fit, your life is now complicated by the fact that multiple microcontrollers need to communicate with each other, which means you have to deal with very limited number of IO ports per microcontroller and waste LOC doing IO plumbing.- Even if you optimize the design cost and LOC count, there is a third metric that you can do badly on which is ""power"". It's basically the ""time complexity"" of your solution as more LOC executed means more power expended.All of this forces you to come up with super hacky solutions which captures the very spirit of code golf!Oh, and briefings for each assignment relayed to you as emails from bosses and colleagues are pretty hilarious."
319,2637,"Out of all the programming puzzle games I've played so far, this one takes the crown. It is also one of the hardest and does not pull any punches even at the beginning. But that also makes it so rewarding when you finally manage to beat a really complex challenge after several hours of experimenting - and then you go back to the drawing board and try to optimize your solution to beat your friends' highscores.Word of warning: It barely has any ingame tutorials and instead tries to be immersive by providing you with a 40+ pages PDF manual of the various microcontroller components that are used throughout the game and its puzzles. You may even print it out if you want the full immersive experience of being a contract worker who creates little electronic gadgets according to customer specifications. Alternatively, having a second monitor to view the PDF on the other screen instead of tabbing out of the game can help a lot.But if a game that makes you feel like doing actual work is not your idea of a relaxing evening, this one may not be the right choice for you."
320,2636,"Exactly what I expected :) Much like Human Resource Machine in terms of puzzle/algorithm solving, and optional more optimal solutions. The game gives sufficient enough info that you can code, yet at the same time little enough info to give you room to figure things out on your own; and that also improves the realism theme :) The manual is very playful and fun to read (for a technical reference, that is)"
321,2636,"This game is strange, as it's a puzzle game imitating a job, and a large part of its initial difficulty is the lack of tutorial, tips, or even explanations about anything. They do provide a manual in pdf form, which they actually recommend printing out and putting in a binder, but I found that after watching a video just explaining the basics of the assembly code they use I've been able to progress, referencing the manual occasionally. I recommend playing this game if you like puzzles and problem solving, regardless of if you know how to code. Shenzhen can be a nice way to relax after a stressful day at work, as problem solving with no stress is quite enjoyable. I will say it's worth the full price for most people but some may only be satisfied with their purchase when it goes on sale."
322,2636,Excellent!
323,2636,"It's a game where you write assembly. The tutorials start you off quite easily, if you have any programming background, but you'll soon run into some tough problems, mostly trying to shave off an instruction here or there. Probably one of the best ways to learn how to optimize code, though."
324,2635,"I really like the solitaire variant, keeps me on my toes.As a side note, the main game is a whimsical take on embedded development that makes artistic simplifications while still conveying a very real sensation of programming in assembly language. Complete with an occasional poorly documented datasheet, which I've heard hits home a bit too hard for actual embedded developers. If it's your job to program microcontrollers for extremely cost-optimised products, this might not be the game for you. On the other side, if you don't like programming puzzles, this is definitely not the game for you. The language is not very conducive to nested loops/conditionals or even ""else if""s, and you only get 12 lines of code or less to work with, which could definitely be off-putting to some. But for those of us who like seeing how few lines something can be coded in, how we can make shortcuts within the limited nature of the language, and even a little bit of hardware selection, there's quite a bit of depth and some significant replayability.The solitaire is more replayable though, it's really good."
325,2635,My Computer Organization class should just have been playing this game.
326,2635,"OK.. this is significantly more difficult than ExaPunks, due in part to the way the manual works which is seemingly less informative, but having said that you do just have to play with the parts and see what each component does or doesn't do. You may have to look up some help to understand the nuances of the game, too me a little while to understand sleep and the errors around it (looking at reddit and other places it seems it's common issue). Once you get the hang of it, it's great. This isn't for everyone, and if gaming is meant to be relaxation, don't play this. It really makes you think hard."
327,2635,"It's fun, especially the solitaire minigame."
328,2635,Write a review for SHENZHEN I/OPlease describe what you liked or disliked about this game and whether you recommend it to others.Please remember to be polite and follow the Rules and Guidelines.
329,2635,"I'm by far no where near a coder, nor a smart dude. So this game is easily mind boggling BUT it turns out to be a lot of fun, spending time just trying to figure something out and coming out on top is so damn rewarding. Definitely challenging just to complete, even more challenging to optimize, but still very very entertaining.An upgrade to TIS-100, both visually and mental-poking."
330,2635,Masochism and problem solving made fun!
331,2634,Feels like a job. I love it.
332,2634,"a game all about programming. the language isn't really something very modern, but it teaches the principles of coding, so you actually are learning while having fun; well, having fun if you like to solve problems."
333,2634,"No tutorial, just an unintuitive or dare I say counterintuitive PDF filled with bloat-fluff emails and lazy photocopies random .People are just afraid to give this crappy game a negative review because they think it'll make them look dumb for not understanding how circuits work.Why would a game just drop you in the deep end and have you referencing a PDF to find out what these super abbreviated terms mean? As it's a programming game I'm fine with the idea of referencing a PDF but really i should be able to do that  in game without tabbing out. It's just eye straining and too similar to real life. Games are escapism and this is not escapism if I've got to reference a PDF and nor is it real life meaning it's stuck in this limbo of being a waste of time. You wanna learn about circuitry? read a  book"
334,2634,"Featuring a higher level programming language than the one in TIS: 100, Shenzhen I/O is closer to modern day programming and, subsequently, should appeal to more players in general, newcomers and industry veterans alike. For the computer-engineering interested, but still unitiated folks, Shenzen I/O might not teach you a useful programming language, but it is great for learning programming in general."
335,2634,"If you ever wanted to build things but didn't understand how a microcontroller worked on a PCB with the rest of the componets this, THIS is what you NEED.  Also do read the manual included in the game. Gives the very basics of what assembly code commands do. My background is more mechanical design so this is a itch that always bugged me. It's still there but improving. This game get a 9/10 from me, I really feel it to be a 10 but the manual isn't strucutured correctly so it losses a point. This type of game is a first for me so take that into context.  Buy it only if you want to learn how ""computers"" work in a general sense. This is one of those in it for the long haul game. Like dark souls but in no way similar."
336,2634,"I have been interested in programming and have learned higher levels of programming like java and python, but this game is a great way to learn assembly. I have had the most fun by going back to older puzzles and trying to beat my friend's score."
337,2634,very straightforward
338,2634,"Man I'm just getting started and I'm having so much fun. These challenges are just that, actual challenges, and not only that but I'm familiarizing myself with programming assembly which to me is so cool that you can do both in a single game. Thanks devs, you're great"
339,2634,this is basically what i studied in school and what i do for a lving
340,2633,"I'm still working through the game slowly... to be honest, I spent a lot of my play time on the Solitaire game inside this game. It's great... not hard, but a very fun variation of solitaire.Regardless... I love the atmosphere of the game. It's very immersive, has thoughtful writing, and so far I'm having a lot of fun building these various devices. You should play it!"
341,2633,"a bit tough to get going, but well worth it if you are fan of Exapunks or TIS-100"
342,2633,Very nice concept. Surprisingly easy once you get the hang of it. I recommend printing the assembly instructions.
343,2632,"One of the best games for people that like circuits and programming, its a good way to understand small yet important concepts of embedded systems and have a clue of how Assembly and low level microprocessor and components works."
344,2632,"EVERY ee student should buy this.But if you really do, you may realize it less fun compared with Altium Designer"
345,2632,pretty good if you have the time to learn
346,2631,"I've been a hobbyist programmer since the days when the C=64 was new, and a puzzle fan for even longer, and this game lets me exercise both these parts of my brain, wrapping it in a decent if not compelling storyline -- add in the interesting take on Mah-jong Solitaire, and this has had me hooked since 2016!"
347,2631,im not even that good at computer programming
348,2630,"Completing even the first few puzzles has been extremely satisfying.  I don't really know coding at all so this is a doubly steep learning curve.  And really the hard part is memorizing the functions so you can more easily test your code instead of referencing the manual so much.  And besides that its learning how the software reads your code and works with conditions which is super simple but you need to get your mind right or at least I did.How it playsSo far at the most basic level you are provided an input and then required to change that into what the output needs to pass a simulation.  The input has a level of intensity so to speak and your output can as well.  There is a timing aspect called sleep (slp) that allows 'time' to pass otherwise the computer chip will just keep running your lines of code.  And once you've recognized the pins and what you are attempting then you test your code till you get the match.  You can test it step by step of instructions you've got in the chip or by advancing time one increment at a time; so you can always see exactly where your fault lies.  And like modern day coding software it'll point out all the times you've done something that doesn't compute.  I'm sure other coding software isn't this simple but you've barely got a handful of basic instructions, the usual math types, conditional types (for logic, you'll be using these a lot I imagine), and that's about it.DifficultyIs it hard?  Yes, but only because this isn't a FPS like I'm used to playing these days.  It is foreign to me.  Once I have an even better grasp of the rules like I can tell I'm getting after only 4 hours then I should be testing code at an incredible pace.Besides the difficulty in the sandbox-esq way of solving problems via code the other constraints can be things like your budget and number of lines of code per chip.  Can you run this request on one chip because the PCB is so small it could barely fit two chips?I GIVE THIS A DEFINITE BUY ESPECIALLY IF YOU ALREADY HAVE OTHER ZACHTRONICS GAMES BECAUSE YOU'LL KNOW KIND OF WHAT YOU'RE GETTING INTO.  If you haven't played a Zachtronics game before maybe don't start here."
349,2630,This is an electronics engineer simulator. Great Game
350,2630,Really hard but really fulfilling when it works!
351,2630,"I really want to like this game, but it needs an in game lead in and it doesn't have one.  That's a deal breaker for me.  I don't want to keep a web page open to read a manual while playing the game.  And I don't have a printer to print it out like they recommend so I have to keep alt-tabbing out to look at it anyway.  Nope.   Not going to happen."
352,2629,"Lots of flexibility in puzzle solution, lots of room to improve over time. If you get stuck on one puzzle you probably have others to do in the meantime.Also, the solitaire game is entrancing. I'm not surprised it got its own standalone option.Update: Most of my play time on this game is for the solitaire, now."
353,2629,"Amazing ""game."" I played it first when I was in high school, and loved it then. I am now in college and a computer science major, and I have got to say, understanding real assembly language was a breeze thanks to this game. I loved solving all the puzzles in this masterpiece, and it helped me realize that computer science is the field for me.This is the most educational game I have ever played, and it is truly a masterpiece.Highly recommended"
354,2629,I think I forgot to eat. All I've done is move microcontrollers and machine code around for 3 solid days.
355,2628,"A fun and challenging puzzle game that incorporates programming and hardware design.  While it won't land you a real job working with microcontrollers, it certainly gives you a taste for the kinds of things that go into making little gadgets."
356,2628,The best Zachtronics game.
357,2628,"Everything I love in a puzzle game. Interesting problems presented for free-form solving with a cohesive tool kit and just enough restriction to keep it mind-bending. After a long day of programming at work, I do love to unwind with a bit of programming."
358,2628,"AMAZING!  If you like Software or Electrical Engineering, you'll love this.  The solutions aren't hard to figure out, but getting it to fit into the limited lines of code, board space, and number of open ports is what makes it challenging.Also I like how there's not just one answer to everything; you can go back and optimize your solutions for power consumption, cost, or lines of code, and see how you stack up against your friends."
359,2627,"When I finish a design, I get stats about how I did in terms of parts cost, power consumption and lines of code, compared to other players. So, naturally, if my design turns out to be too expensive, I'm tempted to go and optimize it. On one of the designs I spent HOURS trying to bring it to the optimal solution. And was not able to. The reason? It turns out that the manual does not contain all available instructions, and you only learn about them later in the game.Really annoyed by this, no desire to continue."
360,2627,"This game is quite enjoyable. It's puzzling and the puzzles are reasonably difficult -- they don't take too long and the game feels like it progresses nicely. Also, the music is really nice. I very much enjoy it. It's a great option if you like a calming sort of excitement."
361,2626,Connect things to things
362,2626,"It's very satisfying, and the combination of laying out the board and connecting everything makes it feel quite immersive. The learning curve is perhaps a little steeper than Spacechem or Opus Magnum, but as long as you RTFM and keep the quick reference handy it is easy to become fluent pretty quickly."
363,2626,solitaire is fun when you're watching livestreams
364,2626,Zachtronics games all feature extremely well defined game interfaces. The programming games like Shenzhen IO all have a variety of puzzles at different levels of difficulty and great story lines.
365,2626,The most empowering and immersive puzzle game I've played in a long time. I play this on weekends for fun and then feel fresh and pumped up to code at work during the week. Brilliant concept for a game!
366,2626,Best solitaire game ever made.(yes I played nearly 500 hours without solving any of the puzzles!)
367,2626,"Amazing programming/puzzle game, with a bit of a story."
368,2626,My mind sink in this game.
369,2626,"This is a tough one to recommend. It's also a tough one not to recommend for some people.TL;DR review:----------If you enjoy programming, and working with space limitations (limits to the number of programming lines, and hardware space), I would recommend this game. I definitely see the potential fun for people. There is even a level that lets you get creative with all the modules in-game (which is where I ended up stopping).If you are like me and was thinking this will be more of a programming puzzle game that progresses slowly and builds on ideas as you you go, it is tougher to recommend.----------As someone that enjoyed SpaceChem and likes the idea of learning to program, I thought I would try my hand at this game. I do not have prior experience programming, unless you count what I learned in school 20 years ago that I haven't used since, and the very beginnings of learning to program with Python (so sweet f-all).Reading the manual that comes with the game, it seemed a bit daunting and then I started the first puzzle. Let's be clear, there is no real tutorial or step-by-step progression like Space Chem to learn how to play. You are jumping right in, and while the first few puzzles aren't really that hard, you will be spending a lot of time going back and forth to the manual trying to figure out the programming language, its limitations, and why things aren't working like you want them to. Unfortunately, the manual sometimes doesn't explain things very well.Take for instance the 'nop' or no operation command. The manual says ""This instruction has no effect"". What it really should say is that this instruction can be used to pause a module in order to sync commands with other connected modules. The only reason I know this is because the frustration got to the point where I had to see examples of other people solutions, and ended up seeing a post online that actually explained the uses of some of these commands. This made me feel like it defeats the purpose of playing a puzzle game, and turned me off.I don't mind being frustrated with figuring something out, but the amount of time spent inside and outside the game felt like it would be better spent getting frustrated and figuring out a real-world language that also didn't have the game's imposed limitations.I've since moved on to Exapunks and while that game also has you reading .pdf files to learn commands, it already there are more explanations, progression, and in-game tutorials to get you up to speed. We'll see how far I get into that one."
370,2625,It's great.
371,2625,"Zachtronics classic. What else is there to say? f you liked other Zachtronics games and you're looking for more programming puzzles, then this is a blast. Not for the faint of heart. Some prior programming experience is recommended since in typical fashion you are entrusted to read the manual on your own, and you have no idea which command or part does what. (Some find this adds to the overall work simulation experience :p ).Obviously the meat of the puzzle is not just solving the design, but also optimizing it. I found it to be most similar to TIS-100 in that you're using assembly language and putting together discrete parts with minimal lines of code. However, I found this game to be more user-friendly than TIS-100, with a definite real-job feel. I also like that you have a variety of parts that each have slightly different functions. The game becomes a balance between the most efficient coding and the most cost-effective use of product, pushing you to find new and creative solutions.There is also a fun little Solitaire game that is a subtly hilarious send-up of the time honoured tradition of dinking around on your computer when you should be working."
372,2625,"Welcome to another assembly language 101 (or microprocessor programming 101?). I think I enjoyed this game, but I'm not going to recommend this to my friends, as it is a little bit too much programming...In some ways, it is also kind of realistic: costdown, undocumented feature, ..."
373,2624,`goto` statement is the true devil !!!
374,2623,good game for programmers
375,2622,"hardware programming, the game"
376,2622,Interesting approach.
377,2621,"Jesus this game. This game is tough if you don't know much about circuit design. Luckily I have some knowledge on programming theory which came to my aid. I'm about 4-5 levels in and I can honestly say this game is super fun. There is a learning curve, no doubt about that but if you don't mind looking at a manual learn to play a game then boy oh boy do I have a recommendation for you.TL;DR if you want a hard but rewarding puzzle game then I wholeheartedly recommend this."
378,2621,"Maybe (almost certainly) I'm just not as smart as I like to think I am, but the apparently simple tasks in Shenzhen I/O will twist your brain (in a good way). Also a good game to play as a primer for assembly and microcontrollers, although TIS-100 might be a slightly easier introduction to the logic machine puzzles that are Zachtronics games.The aesthetic and documentation, as per usual, is clean and offers surprising insights to one who digs. These aren't the kind of games you play to blow your eyes out, but it offers good feedback and a satisfying visual reward when you manage to get things working. OPEN THE DATASHEETS.Overall would highly recommend to any fans of logic puzzles and optimisation games. I'd say it's my personal favourite of the Zachtronics releases thus far.Tip: gen p x y"
379,2621,Great game!
380,2621,"Really fun electronics simulator game. If you're interested in programming or logic, this game is for you."
381,2621,This game realized my dream of becoming an embedded system engineer. Missed the time of reading data sheets and figuring out pins and memory.
382,2621,If you think assembler is fun
383,2621,Very challenging to someone unfamiliar with assembly language but the manual is useful and concise.
384,2621,yeah gotta say this solitaire game is pretty good
385,2621,"This is my favourite of all Zachtronics games. I particularly enjoy this game's UI that's custom made and unique for every puzzle. Its colors, its look and feel, even its sounds are just incredibly pleasant to experience even when I'm not really progressing through the story. Also reading chinese manual for a microcontroller without proper translation has never been so enjoyable.Disclaimer: like any other Zachtornics game, this one will not teach you real programming. Someone compared programming in Shenzhen I/O to programming in boxing gloves: basically you encounter problems that you never encounter in real development. However, it's very fun."
386,2620,"Easily the weakest Zachtronics game so far. Not terrible, but you should really play all the other Zachtronics games first.It has some cool ideas (e.g. the unique test instructions and ability to use logic gates) that made me really want to like the game, but unfortunately they're overshadowed by the fact that a majority of puzzles are just about marshaling data between the different types of pins rather than actually solving interesting problems. The quirks in the instruction set, the parts list, and the rules surrounding inter-cpu communication seem designed to constantly throw you the same annoying roadblocks, rather than providing for interesting optimization opportunities like in TIS-100 and EXAPUNKS. Because of the need to synchronize not just communication (as in TIS-100) but also sleep cycles, and because of the comically small instruction counts, a majority of code in later puzzles ends up being the same repetitive synchronization idioms.In TIS-100, there was an interesting and fundamental tradeoff when splitting code across multiple nodes. It often increased the node count, usually led to higher instruction count, and could lose cycles to communication overhead. However, it also gave you more registers to work with, as well as opportunities for parallelism, pipelining, and (in some levels) smart use of the JRO instruction. But in Shenzhen, because the game measures POWER (total instructions retired across all CPUs) instead of CYCLES (time until all CPUs are sleeping), pipelining and parallelism are no longer relevant. And obviously more CPUs is bad for cost and lines-of-code as well, so instead of an interesting tradeoff, it's now just a Thing You Never Want To Do But Usually Have To, which just feels, like, bad, man, y'know?In fact, past the first few levels, there aren't many interesting tradeoffs to be made in general. What's good for one metric is usually good for the others, so it's more like you're trying to find the ""right"" answer rather than exploring multiple possible strategies which could lead to solutions that are good along different dimensions. It's more like traditional ""puzzle solving"", instead of the ""problem solving"" that Zachtronics games are known and loved for.If you want well-designed, hard-as-balls assembly programming challenges, I recommend TIS-100. If you want to have fun squeezing every last cycle out of your programs, I recommend EXAPUNKS. The only situation in which I'd recommend Shenzhen is if you've run out of other Zachtronics games to play.EDIT: I forgot to mention, but the solitaire is good."
387,2620,"This is simply the best programming game out there. You can enjoy it at all levels, from a beginner who learns enough coding to complete a few levels to the amazing efforts of a few hardcore fans who get to the top of the various league tables."
388,2619,"Shenzhen IO is quickly becoming my favorite Zachtronics game. While SpaceChem probably had more ""cool factor"" in theory, it turned out to be more frustrating and time consuming in actual practice. What Shenzhen lacks in appeal it more than makes up for in the balanced difficulty and excellent resources. The manual is very helpful and the puzzles are fun and interesting. The OS and interface are also very nice. I feel like the screenshots don't do this game justice. I was initially turned off but later decided to try it out and I'm glad I did.SpaceChem is also a lot of fun, but I am finding this game much more replayable and less head-bashingly frustrating. That's probably because I'm a programmer and not a mechanic. SpaceChem has more to do with using space wisely while this is more about writing good code, although space factors in a little bit."
389,2619,Best version of solitaire out there. There is a pretty neat hardware coding puzzle game included as well.
390,2619,"Tries to be immersive, and disgustingly fails its job, by trying to do it too well. Don't buy this. Just don't."
391,2618,Difficulty level: studying and taking notes. Lots of challenges to face
392,2618,"If you liked TIS-100 you'll like Shenzen I/O. Shenzen 1/0 builds on TIS by adding more components and a much less structured workspace, however the coding is very much the same. You'll do well to RTFM for this game as well."
393,2618,"You probably want to have a good understanding of at least one programming language before playing this game, it will not teach you programming.What it will teach you is how to be creative in problem solving, patience, checking references (the manual) and persistence.I'd probably add this game to my resume/C.V. in future, if I complete it, it's that much of a challenge."
394,2618,Nothing better than programming after a long day of programming at work
395,2618,Excellent game
396,2617,The dude who said voluntary overtime sums it up well
397,2617,Already more than 70 hours playing this game and still exited when discovering new levels. This is really a great game (only for those who love programming :) ).
398,2617,"Another amazing game from Zachtronics. I could play these games all day.This game was amazing from start to finish, very challenging (for me anyway, ive not got any real programming experience, only these types of games) but it keeps you gripped and wanting to come back for more.You pretty much have to print off the instructions for the game, which is presented in datasheets like you would expect from real electronic components. The datasheets give you examples of instructions you can perform with various chips and microcomputers, to solve different puzzles. The puzzles essentially consist of  giving you a bunch of numbers and you have to feed the results back in a computed format.The calculations are done using the coding in the game, its pretty simple once youve done the first couple of levels. (Although i will say it does seem daunting at first) I did struggle with a puzzle towards the end of the game, but i was determined to get through it. You could look up a solution i guess, but that just ruins it, the thrill comes from solving a particularly challenging puzzle.I honestly can't recommend this game enough. The idea is top notch, the music is really good and fits the style well and the fact that you can download additional puzzles from the workshop makes this game amazing value. The story was a bit naff but its not a big deal, the game isnt really about that.If you've played Exapunks and enjoyed it you will love this.Zach keep bringing these games out. 11/10"
399,2617,Fun Game to sit back and think. The fun comes in trying to improve your score beyond just completing the objective.
400,2617,"Another great hit of a puzzle game from this developer. Shenzen I/O puzzles flow in two phases---a macro-level question of what pieces to use and where to place them, and the micro-level question of configuring / coding the individual pieces to solve the puzzle. Coupled with an interesting story, it's a fun play."
401,2617,Needed a lot more hand holding in the early game.
402,2617,"If you ever wanted a way to easy yourself into the world of Assembler syntax, this is it..It's got all the MOV's !"
403,2616,good programming game
404,2616,good
405,2616,This is simply an excellent game.
406,2615,Interested in embedded engineering or solitaire as a hobby? A must have.
407,2615,"Highly addictive puzzle game, especially if you love electronics and coding."
408,2615,"This game makes you think.  Once you've solved a challenge you can how others compared (lines of code, cost, power consumption).  You can the go back and rethink through the problem solving exercise and find where you can optimize code and new ways to apply logic."
409,2615,"Rip My Headthis game is awesome, it is a puzzle programing game that require you to read an actual manuel of 30 pages to actually play the gamethe game require you to really think.other than that, there is not much to saythe music is kinda great, the puzzles are hard."
410,2614,Get it for solitaire.
411,2614,Like solve problems?  Like to make stuff do stuff?  You'll like Shenzhen IO.Zachtronics really knocked it out of the ballpark with Shenzhen.
412,2614,I thought I was a smart man. Then I played this.
413,2614,Not very intuitive at first but the manual idea is great and ctrl-f-ing through it is very fun
414,2613,"MORE THAN A GAMEShenzhen I/O (prounced -> Schenjen) is, for me, the best coding and design game so far!You have to solve certain problems with the help of modules, which you can connect with each other, assembler code and your creative mind.@ add 1

slp 1That's how the code of one module could look like.You will learn it, if you gonna read this guide, and by playing the game!https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=780561888This game is giving me a new view on the approach of problems and helps me to think out of the box. This is an excellent and playfull way to improve one's problem solving skills. #Discussions_QuoteBlock_AuthorYou learn it, by doing it!"
415,2613,"Really interesting game. If you've played TIS-100, this is similar but with new puzzle aspects. A good way to start learning Assembly language, too, if you have never played around with it on any architectures. The puzzles are challenging, and the UI (which is based around an email app in a fake OS) is engaging with some story elements. Absolutely recommended!"
416,2613,I enjoy how this makes my brain feel.  It's not for everyone but if it looks interesting to you it's worth a shot.
417,2613,good solitaire
418,2613,"Actually better than work for people who have to read emails, fill excels and prepare powerpoints now instead of working on actual code."
419,2613,"The first enjoyable ""work game"" I ever played."
420,2612,VERY good
421,2612,"Very fun game, a really good way to improve your problem-solving skills."
422,2612,Good puzzles of moderate difficulty. Worth the price if you are interested in puzzles that challenge you on designing code within a constrained environment.
423,2612,"The puzzles are fun and challenging. Printing the physical reference sheets really makes the game feel immersive, even for a puzzle game."
424,2612,"Work for me is intellectually straining, so when I come home I want a cup of cocoa, my socks off, and to play a mind numbingly easy game, and this game does the trick for me. Just so you know, I do surgery from ground control through quantum worm holes using rockets."
425,2612,This game is a giant brain menuever. It uses an older version of assembly then what it taught today but is an amazing game.
426,2611,This is voluntary overtime.
427,2611,'S pretty good.Kinda puzzling though.
428,2611,Awesome game. Remembers me about Spacechem. LOVE IT
429,2610,I'm big dumb but this game is still really fun once you get a hang of it.
430,2610,"I am a bit late to the Zachtronics library, but Shenzhen I/O is a truly excellent puzzle game.While I am also a fan of TIS-100 (only other Zach title I have played so far), as an experience programmer I found it a little shallow.The component cost and physical space restrictions (component placement) of Shenzhen I/O add a layer of depth that I found extremely engaging.The story element, while light, is also appreciated."
431,2609,"The same warnings apply as with TIS-100: This is about writing code in a made-up assembly language with absurd limitations, and drawing some (minimalistic) circuits, while reading from a manual PDF (which they recommend printing out). You will need to read the manual.It's hard to talk about a Zachtronics game, except by comparing it to others. So, this is TIS-100, plus some of the best of Infinifactory, but also some of the worst of SpaceChem.The main thing it brings over from Infinifactory is a level of polish, which delivers a real theme and atmosphere other than just ""arcane 80's nonsense"":There are recognizable characters that stick with you for most of the story. Even just having an avatar thumbnail adds so much to being able to recognize and follow these jerks through the story.There's a whole Solitaire game thrown in just because, and it's actually legitimately fun, to the point where you may find yourself procrastinating on the actual problem-solving of this game to play Solitaire!There's full Steam Workshop integration, which the game goes out of its way to encourage. When it does, I'd recommend checking out some of the puzzles people are uploaded -- I picked up a couple of tricks from some rather unique puzzles.Modern resolutions, a modern-ish UI, and some music all makes for an experience that's... I guess still charmingly retro in some ways, but much more pleasant to be in for the number of hours it will take to finish this game.Many solution slots per level -- all Zachtronics games before this restrict you to exactly three. You can use this as a poor-man's version control by copying your solution before you attempt a drastic rewiring.And one more thing it has in common with Infinifactory: Stuff you could always do, but the game holds off on teaching you how. With Infinifactory, it's the fact that you can attach pulverizers (among other blocks) to pistons. Shenzhen I/O feels a little cheaper: There's an undocumented instruction you'll be told about later. It is actually in the manual, it's just that the manual's English translation is deliberately incomplete.But it brings back one big thing from SpaceChem that I really didn't miss: Space constraints so tight that, even once you discover that you can hold tab and draw wires/buses underneath components, your solutions will barely fit, and most of your time will be spent finding incredibly tricky wiring to squeeze one more component in, or barely thread a signal through from one side of the board to the other, or squeezing just one more assembly instruction onto a microcontroller.I think part of it is the requirement to optimize multiple space constraints at once -- SpaceChem had limited space in each reactor, and limited space in the overworld to place those reactors and connect them together with pipelines. Shenzhen I/O has limited space for instructions within each controller, and limited board space to place your components (including controllers) and connect them together with wires.Shenzhen I/O also has a flaw I don't think I've seen in Zachtronics before: Vague problem specifications. Several early problems require you to read the problem description extremely carefully, not just to avoid making an incorrect assumption, but to discover assumptions that technically aren't required, but will massively simplify the problem. I found two or three problems in the bonus campaign in which inputs are guaranteed to be single-digit values, and at least one of these never actually says that. You just have to notice the pattern on the verification tab, but you are only shown the first of 80 or so tests -- the only way to see if the pattern you've identified holds true for all tests is to build an entire solution around it!I'm playing through these in release order, and Infinifactory remains my favorite. That's probably partly because of how well it avoids the above problems: It's more generous with space, and the third dimension means there's usually more flexibility in how you fill that space. It felt almost as difficult, except the difficulty was in coming up with a solution in the first place, not in subtly moving solutions around. It had metrics like ""footprint"" in case you wanted to do that kind of thing, but then it was about getting a higher score, not just about completing the level! And of course, there's never any doubt about what the goal even is."
432,2609,The next time someone brags about beating Dark Souls because it's 'hard' tell them to play halfway through this game.
433,2609,how about some tutorial for the dumbs?
434,2608,"Too big brain game  for you, don't buy it."
435,2608,Very fun. Very Zachtronics.
436,2608,"Game is simple and a lot of fun. I'd recommend this to anyone who's thinking about getting into embedded systems, or an electrical engineer who's just looking for a fun game to relax with. Best for people who have no experience and are looking for a fun introduction into what it's like."
437,2608,Great game. It really questions my abilities as a programmer - BUT FOR FUN.
438,2607,"i study computer science and this is not that different from the type of homework we get assigned. only gripe I have about this ""game"" is that you don't get any college credit for doing something that feels like work. but if that's the kind of fun you'r into - get it right away!"
439,2607,SOLID GAME!!!!!
440,2607,Nice one!
441,2607,Awesome.

448,2606,"Fun puzzle game, great aesthetics!"
449,2606,"All the Zachtronics games are great and this one is no different. I did enjoy Spacechem and Opus Magnum more than this one, but i've still racked up 150 hours on it so it's not like I was disappointed.If you enjoy programming and puzzles, this game is a must-buy."
450,2605,this game is hard. its really hard. still fun though. 7/10
451,2605,
452,2605,"Not for everyone but a brilliant, hard little puzzle game"
453,2605,"This is truly a fun and challenging game that pushes my understanding of programming to a different space. While this won't necessarily be a good introduction to programming, I still enjoy the puzzles and then finding ways to tweak and improve my solution a little."
454,2605,Only played the included Solitaire variation so far... can recommend wholeheartedly!
455,2604,Almost too much like real life. love it.
456,2604,"I don't know why this game might appeal to you; it doesn't appeal to most people I know.  It might inspire someone to learn software development and hardware engineering.  I don't honestly know.  I play it because if I go a few days without creating something, I just don't feel right.  If you have that itch, this will scratch it most effectively."
457,2604,200iq game
458,2604,"This game is excellent entry level assembly puzzle. It reminds me my 8051 and PIC programming days.Pros:- Challenging- Improves logical thinking (better than Sudoku)- Introduces difficult assembly programming concept in interesting and engaging way- Teaches principals of embedded systems programming - I/O, registers, math and logical ops- Loads of fun for programming nerds (as myself)Cons:- It may not be for everyone- Not easy - RTMF may not be fun when you're just looking to shoot things on the screen :P"
459,2604,Very good logic training.
460,2604,Great solitaire experience with some circuit/low level programming built-in.

466,2603,"great game couldnt get past the ""PASSIVE INFRARED SENSOR"" level but solitaire is pretty good"
467,2603,"If you like programming, this game is wild fun. The genre of games that boil down to ""program in Assembly, but like a really weird Assembly"" is far too small. TIS-100 is another good one if you like this genre."
468,2603,"- it's another programming puzzler- though there's a spatial element to it, e.g. position of boards, there are no puzzles built around that. Most of your decisions will be how to achieve solutions with sets of boards. The space itself serves a general upper bound on the number of boards you can use.- in the chronology of Zach games, this one had more personality than the others before it (subjective)- puzzles are not ""tight"" similar to TIS-100 but rather how can you efficiently achieve solutions to which, you find self-imposed constraints that make the puzzles feel ""tight"".- there are sometimes animations of the device you're implementing. No impact to the puzzles but very fun eye candy.- Solitaire is addicting, I don't know why.Anecdotal:- My favorite part of this game is the personality, feeling like a newcomer to a country and company and learning about the culture of both.- My 2014 Macbook Pro 13"" huffs and puffs like crazy for some reason playing this."
469,2603,Is there any logic remaining in your brain after hours of 3D battles? If there is you may enjoy this.
470,2603,"Great zachtronic. As always with these games, it might be a little too difficult for me, but it's still a lot of fun to play."
471,2603,"Shenzhen I/O is a programming game that kind of cleverly simulates a job. Maybe think of it as Euro Truck Simulator for software development. The home screen is made up to mimic a desktop with an email client that you use to access your assignments. Each assignment is a programming puzzle in an invented form of assembly. The game comes with a manual pdf that you must read explaining the language and hardware.To solve the puzzle you have to choose and arrange hardware elements, writing assembly to run on each of the elements. Your solution is then validated against test cases (pairs of input and expected output) to determine if you have found a correct solution. The puzzles can be quite challenging and I find it hard to imagine that anyone that doesn't already have experience programming (either in school, professionally or as a hobby) could enjoy it. That isn't because any particular real-world knowledge is required to solve any puzzles, but I think the style of thinking would just be too foreign if you didn't already have experience with it.The fictional desktop is very cute and amusing. It has really well designed 'startup' and 'shutdown' sounds that perfectly mimic retro OS sounds with a slightly oriental flair. The desktop even has a unique form of solitaire! Overall I definitely enjoyed Shenzhen I/O and its close relative, TIS-100. Both are extremely similar so I would recommend them both!"
472,2603,Nep Nep Nep Nep
473,2603,Great game! Print the manual if your company doesn't watch their printer too closely.
474,2603,"If someone ask you how it is to be an engineer, give him this game saying only ""Finish it without cheating... The deadline is this friday"""

478,2601,What's better than some coding after a day of coding?
479,2601,"Recommended for people wishing to feel like making hardware and code assembly. Basic reading skills required to learn the programming language/read the fine manual. :-) This is an interesting puzzle/coding game where the player get to design, wire and program devices to meet task criterias (a.k.a. to function properly). Results from running program is then split into different categories allowing for some replayability. Players can also compare their results against other players results to compete in making more and more efficient solutions."
480,2601,This game makes me feel really stupid but the solitaire is really good.Honestly as hard as it is fiddling with electronics is still more fun than shooting people.
481,2601,This game is very logical and a very unique puzzle game using embedded design using real life documents. Best to print the 47 odd pages into a folder or a second screen for the PDF file. Its a lot of fun but very hard too.
482,2601,"Love this game! Now I sit all day at work, finish it as quickly as I can in order to get home and do almost the same stuff in this game! :D"

485,2601,Brainbusting and addictive!
486,2600,"Considering I've reset the game multiple times just to play the same levels over and over again, because it's that fun, yeah, thumbs up!"
487,2600,Good puzzle game for a somewhat special audience. If you're into digital electronics and/or computer science this is recommended for you.
488,2600,"The best Zachlike since SpaceChem.  (Are they really Zachlikes when they all come from Zach?  Aren't they just... Zachs?)Much like SpaceChem, it's a going-to-work simulator.  Why is this fun?  It sounds like it shouldn't be.  But it is.  You're given puzzles (in the form of serious assignments from your boss or wacky product ideas from your company's goofy ""concept guy."")  Then you design them and see how you did compared to other players of the game.The gameplay is a little like TIS-100 in that it's programming in an absurdly limited assembly language, although some specifics of the language differ slightly.  But TIS-100 didn't give you any flexibility in the way the code modules are connected, so it never felt like you were creating something, it just felt like you were trying to find the solution to a puzzle.  Here, your design has to meet the spec and pass the tests, but you're given much more flexibility in how to approach it.  So you're not looking for ""the"" solution, you're looking for ""your"" solution.  That makes it so much more fun, and more rewarding to chase after a good solution instead of one that just barely works.The game has interesting characters and just enough window dressing that it just ""feels real.""  TIS-100 seemed so much more sterile.  Sure, you only interact with the characters through email, but is that really that different from most NPCs in games?Presenting most of the game's documentation in the form of product datasheets... well, if you've done any electronics design, it'll seem very familiar, and it makes the game feel more realistic.Overall, it's fun, with the caveat that it is a Zachlike and so it is naturally not for everyone.  But if the idea of a game that blurs the lines between logic puzzles and programming seems fun, then give it a shot."
489,2600,"Really fun for the geeks out there. Also a pretty good way to teach learning a computer language. The asm used in the game is really simple and easy to get, and the way you have to look up data sheets and stuff is really realistic, but simple at the same time. Fun game especially for those who already have a good understanding of computers."
490,2600,Cool game.
491,2600,"Zachtronics makes the best code golf games, and this one has arguably the most mechanically interesting hook, as it feels very practical; you could pretty easily take the things you learn/write in pseudo-ASM in this and convert it over to Arduino. Definitely not a substitute for actually programming, but good to keep those skills sharp and come back every now-and-then for some golf."
492,2600,"Just don't become a communist, and realise this is a game that celebrates the capitalist utopia we currently live in, then you'll enjoy the game."
493,2600,"The main campaign is fun, although it does get challenging towards the end. The story although only told through e-mails really engaged me. The bonus campaign felt too much of a chore. I still keep going back to the Solitaire game :-)Also, they're not kidding. Read the manual."
494,2600,Great Solitare simulator with a bonus programming minigame.
495,2598,Accurate China electronics simulator
496,2598,"If i wanted to do my work for 'fun' i would do my job on the weekends. I code IRL, coding games do nothing to me but just burn out, the challenges are cool, but i really dont like them"
497,2597,This is a great programming puzzle game. You have to read an actual manual to play it. Gets harder and harder as you progress through the campaign. Also hard to get back to the game after you didn't play it for some time because you forget how everything works.
498,2594,I was craving more Exapunks and saw this was an earlier Zach gameI feel I was spoiled by Exapunks and the language in this game is just inferior and frustrating and is not very enjoyable like Exapunks is. I think Exapunks will probably be the only Zach game I will have any interest in.
499,2592,"This is a fantastic gameI just finished every puzzle including the bonus campaign, optimized for price to the best of my capabilities and I just noticed how many hours I spent on this game to reach this point...10/10 would pull my hair over the lack-of-space-to-cram-that-f***ing-final-intruction again"
500,2592,"so far so good, i'm not far into the game yet but i'm enjoying everything about it"
501,2592,R T F M
502,2590,"My printer is busted so I can print out the instructions on how to play the regular game, but the Solitaire is top notch."
503,2590,"As an electronics maker and C++ / JavaScript coder by day, trying to work with 16 instructions max and 2 bytes of memory per chip is deeply offensive.But Shenzhen also includes, hands down, the best version of Solitaire ever made, so at least pick it up for that."
504,2590,Fantastic game once you read the manual. If you don't... It'll gather dust in your library.
505,2590,Very good game for friend competition
506,2589,"This is easily the most immersive puzzle game I have ever played and my personal favorite of all the Zachtronics games, possibly because I have lived as an expatriate in China similar to the player character. Printing the manual and really living in the world of Shenzhen was a truly unique experience. EXAPUNKS is similar and probably more fun, but it did not have quite the same sense of accomplishment when completing a task. TIS-100 is also similar and more challenging, but it is almost entirely abstract. This game is a real sweet spot of all the things that make Zachtronics special."
507,2589,"Don't buy this game with the expectation of relaxing. First you have to study the commands out a pdf document. With my procrastination traits it took some time to finally get into this game, the example codes in there weren't helping at first sight. After spending some time studying the document I finally could get started. It's really satisfying when you solve the problems and find more efficient ways to do so. This game can be very exhausting or I'm just too dumb."
508,2589,Very good.
509,2587,simply amazing
510,2586,"This was a tough thumbs down, as I own and love all Zacktronics stuff.  But there's such a thing as ""entry experience"" in games, and the smoother that is, the better the game will fare.  There's a lesson they learned somewhere in there, when you compare the gameplay/interfaces of TIS-100, Shenzen, and Exapunks.  TIS laid its premise and logic bare from the beginning, and it was up to the player to stare at it long enough to understand.  Exapunks went the other direction, layering story and nostalgia and abstracting the core puzzle play enough to make it interesting.But the key is that in Exapunks, the abstracted gameplay is still placed in front of the player.  With Shenzen, you re-directed twice from opening emails, asked to literally print out and tab the manual (!), and even then, the entry point into the game narrative isn't clear without some diddling about.  IMPORTANT:  Your games are ABOUT logic puzzles.  Your fans aren't afraid of them, nor need a cover story.  In Shenzen, I've never seen a cover story or abstraction so badly implemented.  Sorry, but if an interested, motivated player is left staring at a screen with no useful information, nor clear way to access said useful information, you aren't doing it right.  I'm sure I'll continue to play once I understand the silly cover story and abstractions, but it shouldn't require this much work.  Give me TIS-100 all day over this."
511,2586,Possibly one of the best programming games I've played!
512,2586,This game requires extensive use of the game manual to look up datasheets and such.So if you are still here after the word manual; then you'll probably like this games. The puzzles are fun and require some thought to accomplish. I've played other games in this style and they tend to have some monotonous solutions. I do feel that Shenzhen I/O avoids that route and instead focuses on minimizing code.
513,2586,"Expect an unforgiving challenge, but this is a culmination of previous Zachtronics programming games.  Shenzhen I/O's worldbuilding truly goes above and beyond to provide ample context for an enjoyable crash course in programming and circuitry."
514,2586,"The perfect game to introduce someone into the Zachtronics games, if you aren't already a codemonkey.I had bought a couple of their other games purely because the concept intrigued me, but the learning curve was too steep. When i picked this one up, I actually printed the manual (on a whim) and really figured it all out. That being said, there's not a single other game that has made me feel so satisfied when I figure out the solution to the puzzle. I'm not generally animated, but i find myself fist pumping and getting up to hug my daughter when I finally get it. The pacing of the game is nice, the way it introduces new ideas is slow and steady, not to mention how much thought they put into the worldbuilding. it's the little things, folks.I'll update it when i get further, but after playing the amount i have, i already plan on adding their other games to my collection."
515,2586,"Update: After some reading and thinking I finally realised why I don't like this game, I suck at making algorithms and due to the structure of some of the puzzles it's nearly impossible to brute force solutions like in ExapunksSo if you want coding puzzles and like making algorithms get this game, if you want coding puzzles and algorithms hurt your brain get Exapunks.Old review:I bought this because I enjoyed Exapunks, but I am not enjoying Shenzhen I/O. I don't know if it's the differences in the documentation (helpful 'zines vs a barebones tutorial and terrible datasheets) or just because Shenzhens puzzles are a lot more space constrained, but I'm am finding the later puzzles in Shenzhen to be impossible without looking up tips or solutions on Reddit. Maybe I'm not the target audience, but I feel like the game could be a lot more accommodating if it had an easy mode (more space on the board or in the MCs) or if there was some way to get tips in game (like extra emails from Carl or Jie if you get stuck)So if you came here hoping to find something similar to Exapunks you might end up being disappointed like me."
516,2585,"Like most Chinese stuff, IT DON'T WORK! waste of money!"
517,2585,Awesome game for hobbyist coder.
518,2585,"Another great programming puzzle game from Zachtronics. If you're reading this, you probably already know whether this game is for you or not."
519,2585,"If you have to code hacks, do them in this game and not in you workplace."
520,2585,"So it turns out I'm mediocre at embedded systems but really good at solitare, so that's nice."
521,2585,Best programming game I've ever played. Super.
522,2585,This would have to be the worst game of solitaire I have ever played. You cant get achievements without playing solitaire so for those that are achievement hunting forget this game.Trying for the achievements I have spent 5 hours getting 5 wins on the stupid solitaire game. At this rate to get the 100 wins it will be 100 hours. Average 30 seconds per game till stuck that's 600 games so far. This is worse than putting a maze in an adventure game it makes it look like it is a good game to spend time on. Except the experience of gaining the achievements is not there.
523,2585,Good solitaire
524,2585,Got it on sale for 5 bucks after looking through some of the reviews and man oh man was it worth it. Really clever puzzles with multiple possible solutions keeps you hooked until you find the answer and then it won't let you go until you optimize/refine it which programming is really all about.
525,2585,"If you hate assembly, this will prob help you hate it less"
526,2585,tfw you can't afford to buy real electronics so you play a game about fake electronics
527,2584,"Ah, this games reminds me why I stopped programming...I suck at itReally really suckLet me simulate it one more time"
528,2584,
529,2584,"Very challenging, but very much fun."
530,2583,I wish I had known that this was the type of game that has a binder of a manual necessary to play.  If you have a cerebral or otherwise mentally intensive job then this is not the game for you.  After 9 hours of calculations the absolute last thing I want to do is play this game.  When I become a full time hobo I'll reconsider giving this game a shot.
531,2583,After complexity of MIPS-like assembly code of Integrated Circuits from the Stationeers game this feels much easy to understand from beginning.
532,2583,
533,2583,"I can write assembler just fine, But not play solitaire."
534,2583,"Fantastic solitaire game. There's also some minigame about programming I think, which you can play if you get bored?"
535,2583,nice puzzle game
536,2583,The solitaire's pretty good.
537,2583,"Oh, is the sun rising? I gotta go to bed!"
538,2583,Fun game that have a good lengin cruve
539,2583,I would never have thought programming embedded microcontrollers could be this fun
540,2583,"Honestly one of my favorite Zachtronics. All his games are easily the best programming games around and this one is perhaps my favorite. If you like programming and want a fun game to sharpen your skills on, this is perfect for you!"
541,2583,what the 
542,2583,RTFM
543,2582,"What a masterpiece in logic puzzle design. The amount of satisfaction you feel from getting your designs just that tiny bit more efficient is incredible, especially when you get your scores lower than your friends. If you are a perfectionist, this is the game for you."
544,2582,Nice game
545,2582,"Even before I picked up on the concepts of procedural programming, SHENZEN I/O would have appealed to me and after playing it for several hours already I'm hooked! If you love programming and puzzles or if you're like me and have to program something even while you're supposed to be on vacation, then this game is for you!"
546,2582,love it !! really nice programming puzzle ... looking forward to solve it all ^^
547,2582,"Real programming, wonderful problem solving and optimization. I recommend this to just anyone who loves programming."
548,2582,"Come for the programming puzzles, stay for the surprisingly good solitaire game."
549,2582,Pretty great and challenging puzzle game. Much harder than some other zachtronics games like Opus Magnum. It can feel a lot like actual work at times but I like that sort of thing.
550,2582,"Wonderful little puzzle game, especially if you're into these sorts of things. Might learn a thing or two about programming as well."
551,2582,Love it !
552,2582,"Absolutely fantastic, can't get enough of Zachtronics' games"
553,2582,"Another great entry in Zachtronic's programming/logic suite of games. Solid, difficult."
554,2582,Great but could have more parts.
555,2582,Never have I had so much fun feeling so inadequate.
556,2582,Interesting concept
557,2582,Probably one of my favorite puzzle games ever created!It has the perfect balance between being so challenging you never get anything done and being boring it is just the perfect puzzle game!I love all the games from Zachtronics and can only highly recommend all of them.
558,2582,One of the best Zachtronics games out there by far.
559,2582,An amazing little puzzle game that is essentially doing electrical engineer homework.  Highly recommended to those who are into that sort of thing.
560,2582,Kinda TIS-100 taken to the power of ten.
561,2582,"Many of the puzzles are confusing, the reliance on the manual is annoying, and the best part of the game is the solitaire."
562,2582,"Definitely a great game if you're interested in hardware design. Puzzles are interesting and fun, and there is a lot of content to keep you going. The aesthetic is also great. If you don't have patience, I can see how this game might be frustrating, but it can be quite rewarding if you can stick with it."
563,2582,"cool stuff, ngl"
564,2582,"A very good puzzle game from Zachtronics. If you enjoy technical, programming-esque logic puzzles, I'd highly recommend this.The gameplay is a combination of figuring out the physical logic connections of a set of chips, and programming the assembly code for said chips. It's definitely not for everyone, but if you have enjoyed any of the other Zachtronics games, give this one a go too."
565,2582,"The last time I felt this unprepared for a project, I had to redo my senior year! 10/10"
566,2582,Finally you can work after work or on a weekend. What else can you dream of?
567,2582,lit
568,2582,A great game to challenge your thinking. Working in a restrained environment leads to you having to think about how every part of your programming works and how to change it. This game makes me feel dumb in a good way.
569,2582,"A game that emphasize on problem solving and optimization, hell, I learn more this game than in Programming classes."
570,2582,The solitaire game is sooo awesome :)
571,2582,Bought this game and spent all my time playing solitaire instead of actually playing the game...so exactly like work
572,2582,"Hey, it's not every day that someone can make programming microcontrollers fun, can it?Well, it's a start!"
573,2582,"Think of TIS-100's assembler but with a focus on hardware. Designing circuits, using logic gates, making the most design possible, etc. You have open ended tasks where you can have a few approaches. The Shenzhen, China setting is also really cool. Highly recommend."
574,2582,This could easily be used as advertisement for the study of computer science and introduces you to the subject of machine code with less hassle than many universities would
575,2582,"Best game of zachtronics for me so far. If you've enjoyed tis100 go for it , well worth the price"
576,2582,challenging and yet addictive. would recommend 10/10
577,2582,Fun game
578,2582,"Very cool (and extremely hard) little game about programming, which forces you to think at a really low level and try to optimize down to very few lines of code. It also requires reading through a PDF manual in order to understand how different hardware components work, just like you'd do in real life. If you already know the fundamentals of programming, I definitely recommend it."
579,2582,Love it !Spent hours outside the game reflecting on the best ways to do things ! I improved my logic even if it is far from a real assembly language.
580,2582,"Love going back from my programming job, to do some more programming in a game."
581,2582,"Nice programming ""simulator"""
582,2582,"Shenzhen I/O Is amazing!If you enjoyed TIS 100 you will certainly love this game as well.Like TIS 100, this game will come with a manual that you have to read in order to learn the code and chips.There are many ways to solve a puzzle, but what really shines in these games is having friends who will compete with you.You can always optimize your code and get better scores which is part of the fun.It includes sandbox in which you can even make amazing games or programs and of course, an amazing Solitaire version that is as addicting as the game itself."
583,2582,"SHENZHEN I/O, or Zachtronic games in general, are a great way to relaxwith a nice puzzle where you can think through solutions before trying them out.If you are not bothered by typing or simple programming,I can highly recommend this game to you."
584,2582,"I understand the Chinese more than the game unfortunately. Wish the manual were formatted properly ingame, the printing it out mechanic's cute but I don't want to have to do that to function."
585,2582,"Bought for the puzzles, stayed for the solitaire."
586,2582,The solitaire is pretty neat.
587,2582,I always wanted a circuit kit to play around with. Don't need one now.
588,2581,As with all Zachtronics games this is a masterpiece of original and unique challenges for the mind.
589,2576,"This is great!  Solving the puzzles is fun, and it mirrors a lot of the considerations that go into embedded software and systems design.  The big hook is not just solving each puzzle, but optionally doing so as efficiently as you can (by using cheaper, less capable parts, and doing so using as few lines of code as you can).  Sometimes I've had a solution in mind, but would fret over a feeling I couldn't shake that I could do it just a little better.Presentation of the game seems really fitting and engaging (for as sparse as it is).  Calls back to old-school games with objectives and character development advanced by email.  Don't worry about ""being a coder"" to enjoy: The coding language is just a few very simple commands.  They are what you use to navigate the math/logic puzzles (spoiler: that's what programming is, at its core).  You can even create you own free-form project, using the components added to your tool kit along the way.  If the description/screenshots appeal to you, grab this, it rocks!"
590,2574,"This game is so awesome. Perfect design, good instruction, together with a mah-jiang freecell game. Can't love it more."
591,2574,"Game won't start on latest Windows 10, Ridiculous."
592,2574,"Good game to use to introduce someone to Assembly language, though the difficulty curve takes a sharp turn.  Also comes with a solitaire game (that I found harder than the main game)."
593,2573,These guys continue to do it right.
594,2573,After 162 hours I just hit 1337 win count in Solitaire and I barely managed to play the actual game.10/10 - would ignore whole experience because of stupid mini-game again.
595,2572,
596,2570,8.5/10
597,2569,"Remove a chip here, a phone jack there. COST MINIMIZED!!!Don't improve sound quality just amplify it! BEATS HEADPHONES MADE!!!Blame China for shady practices! *Winking Finger Guns*This game is amazing! You should buy it right now.May fruitarianism cleanse our society forever and ever amen. ...Genius? *soft chuckles*"
598,2569,A brilliant game that gets the brain going and is incredibly satisfying. You don't need to be a programmer or to be good at puzzles to get into Shenzhen I/O you just have to learn how to approach tasks in different ways.I would highly recommend the game.
599,2568,the only game in which I play solitaire in order to procrastinate playing the game10/10
600,2568,"I love this game. If you're familiar with code golf, this is assembly putt-putt. For each puzzle, you're given an electrical engineering task, and the straightforward solution isn't going to work because you won't have enough ports, memory, or board space. You'll then have to optimize, rearrange, and cuss at your solution until you manage to pass the tests. After you pass, you'll see that other nerds have created a better solution, so you'll go back and see what else you can optimize.This is a difficult game, and if you're unfamiliar with programming, the difficulty will be amplified. The game also doesn't hold your hand. You're given a manual and expected to figure it out. I did and think it's great."
602,2566,I'm addicted... halp.
604,2566,"RTFM.Seriously, you will have to read the PDF manual to play (and often consult while playing). This is a very polished programming puzzler where you design and program circuits primarily using idealized microcontrollers. It's hard for me to gauge the difficulty of the game, as I have previous experience with assembly and microcontrollers, and I've played Zach's TIS-100.It starts out easy, and gradually steps up in difficulty.I spent about 30 hours on the main campaign, but there's a bonus campaign I haven't tried yet.It's very challenging at times, but equally rewarding.This is an easy recommend."
606,2565,It's more fun to program a real microcontroller in assembly.
608,2563,"Brilliant little game that makes you feel like getting into micro-controllers and assembly. You get to feel good when you end up being at least as efficient as your smart friend. My only complaint is that the game failed to launch on my favorite distro, NixOS, but I solved it by running Ubuntu in Docker :)"
610,2563,SOBAT SET
612,2562,"Thanks to this game, I'm breezing through my x86 assembly class. Highly recommended for a no pressure way to get the basic concepts of assembly programming embedded into your brain."
614,2562,"Well, , I didn't expect this to be actual assembly.It even opens up a PDF manual.Pretty cool and educational. One of the hardest games out there.As someone who hated assembly in college, I have mixed feelings.It's still fun to play with."
616,2562,"I wish there were a middle ground between upvote and downvote, but there isn't, and this just doesn't warrant an upvote. Its biggest problem is that a PDF manual is not a replacement for an in game tutorial, especially for a game where complex behavior based on state is a core feature. Severe spatial constraints on both code and circuit board add challenge, which could be fun except where's the more forgiving work area to try out rough concepts first? Instead of building a progression path where you unlock more interesting controllers to address more difficult assignments, after the tutorial the game literally tells you ""okay I'm unlocking everything now but you really shouldn't use it yet"". Fun core concept that needed a lot more thought around why it was fun and how to draw players in - a surprising swing and a miss given Zachtronics' track record."
618,2560,"maybe not the game for everyone, but for those who like programming and logic a ton of fun."
620,2559,Makes you feel retarded in the best kind of way!
622,2559,"People keep saying the main problem is that the puzzles (besides the first 1 or 2) are too hard and require you to have a background in programming. That just isn't the case. There are only a few rudimentary commands to learn and some basic syntax, which is all explained briefly in about 1 or 2 pages of the manual. Beyond that, there is no need to read the manual until you find yourself using a new part and are trying to learn its function. The code you must write definitely isn't easy, but with a little bit of patience and critical thinking you'll do fine. Also if you get frustrated and want to take a break you can always play solitaire to cool down."
624,2559,"This is such a great game! You need to like programming, if you dont then just pass this game. But if you do, prepare for a challenge in another great Zachlike game"
626,2558,mov 2 manualmov 2 guidesmov 2 discussionsadd 1 line of codeslp 1
628,2557,This Game is way to complicated.
630,2556,"Zachatronics is running totally unopposed in the straight puzzle category. You'll never find a more difficult or unique challenge. SpaceChem was like going from 2D right past 3D into VR for the puzzle genre;  your PopCap,  your Big Fish,  all of that. Zachatronics is killing it."
632,2555,Computer Science - The Game
634,2555,"Very good game, only a few instructions for the fake ASM to learn and a lot of fun."
636,2555,"Were I not a full-time programmer, this would be a great game to practice assembly. I do see enough code during my day, so going home to play programming something that doesn't have a tangible/usable result isn't worth it.Not my cup of tea."
638,2555,"This puzzle game is a maturation of the concepts used in KOHCTPYKTOP and TIS-100. Pseudo-assembly programming of electronic components to make products like card readers or fake Chinese haunted dolls. Well, whatever pays. As board space is limited, the puzzles are quite challenging. I especially like the whole setting and the original tasks that your corporation needs you to solve to earn your place on the market.Ohhh, and it comes with a nice big manual that you can print and show to all your friends to convince them you also play normal games that are nothing like working a job!"
