0,2756,"Uh, so is it just like, doing some 'jobs' cause no money?Overall, the story I still don't get it XDStill a good idea on how to execute some stuff..Some bugs on the typing (especially numbers)I give 4/10 cause good job on the experience they wanna give but on the same thing they didn't LOLJust felt like some of the part isn't really right or close, I would recommend Hack RUN than this :DNOTE: YOU WOULD NOT LEARN HOW TO HACK/PROGRAMMING ON THIS GAME"
1,2756,Meh.
2,2753,"Although the game is not long, but i liked it very much, thanks!!!"
3,2739,"This is actually one of the worst experiences I've ever had playing a game.You have about 2-3 actual mechanics, none of which are fun. The story is nonexistant and very often there is no logical connection between the things you actually have to do.Inputs very often are not taken... so don't wonder when you have to click something 20 times until it gets registered... and the programming sections... like why did the developer have the need to let us hammer aimlessly on our keyboards for 5 minutes?The idea was okay, but there are games that do it WAY better.1/10"
4,2734,"I would REALLY like to give this game a thumbs-up, but I just can't. The game's visuals don't look pleasing to the eye, the translation to English has a lot of holes and doesn't really make sense (so much so that I can't understand what I'm supposed to be doing), you can't drag windows around and I couldn't finish the first chapter, so I skipped to the second, but I couldn't understand that one either. I have no idea how I'm meant to progress in this game."
5,2724,eh
6,2720,hack me hack you.
7,2717,"Hack Me is the beginning of a hack simulator gaming trilogy which no longer appears on the Steam Store. It was originally created by 2 Belarus Indie Developers Egor Magurin https://twitter.com/IndoversStudio and Eugene RadaeV. I find it ironic that these developers themselves were VAC banned and caught for cheating/hacking CSGO within 76 hrs of gameplay. Who better to sell us a hacking simulator than 2 has-been wannabe noob CSGO hackers? Thats poetry right there.If youre expecting this to be a realistic hacking simulator you will be quickly disappointed. Its more a press spacebar or left mouse button simulator, with all the hacking jive being filled in for you. When you do come across areas where you do get to type, you better put in the exact info needed or the game sort of locks up by not responding properly when you put in the correct answer soon thereafter. When this happens, you will need to escape back to main menu and reload chapter. There are 10 mission all up with 14 chapters, all of them involving you to toy around with at least one of the 3 hacking programmes on your desktop and either check your mail or chat for job information. There is also a hint button on the right-hand side to help you if you get stuck.The music is absolutely a dreadful choice from the developer and can only assume it was chosen because it was free. One cheesy soundtrack looped, which is also deafeningly loud as there is no setting menu to turn it down. Undoubtedly a common amateur Indie oversight which has already vexed many streamers and youtubers to stab it with negative reviews.Since the developers are from Belarus, the language translation from Belarus to English is not that fluent numerous times and seems to add to the whole, adolescent student project vibe, I was getting. Also the constant childish digs at Macrosoft instead of Microsoft, Dalve instead of Valve and the vexing mechanic of needing to press spacebar 300+ times so that it can display gibberish made up hack text came off as salty developers making out something that they are clearly not  and that is Good Hackers https://youtu.be/cFj2u3TLn_AIf you enjoyed reading this review feel free to subscribe to my curator page.

8,2713,"It's really good, something like you acting like a hacker =)))not so bad at all.Not so easy and not so hard."
9,2660,"Awfully bad simulator. Only the very exact commands work in a shell, no basic commands or other things. This is the worst and most unrealistic thing ever, In addition, once you click away the information about the very specific commands, you often cannot see them again. Go for ShenZen instead! Far better simulator."
10,2658,Good game.
11,2656,pretty intresting!
12,2649,"Really bad game, DON'T BUY THIS! It's very glitchy and has no copy or paste. So you're basically memorising for the whole game."
13,2638,"The game is super buggy and far from self-explaining. You have to type everything on your own, there is no help, no auto-complete and no copy & paste. You cannot open multiple windows at once, so you have to remember or write down IP addresses, paths and whatever you want to do.Once you do a single wrong or unexpected thing that deviates from the game's script you are stuck. E.g. hacking a nearby WIFI works only on first occurrence - if you close the hacking tool, it will never start again...Finally the game does only support russian and english keyboard layout, there is no chance for any other input style...Don't buy and get other hacking games, there are by far better ones on Steam..."
14,2638,i hack so hard that i found out who joe is
15,2636,    
16,2635,"That's not how hacking works.While yes, a bruteforcer may get that result, it will take much much longer. And the other 'programs' on there may get those results, but that is not how you use them or how they work. This game is more the script kiddie simulator than the hacking simulator. And while the hacking sims and games aren't supposed to be super realistic or even close, this one takes the cake. It's not entertaining or fun in story, the person telling you to hack things is conceited and arrogant sounding the entire time and the game feels like you're trying to be loluber1337.There's misspellings everywhere, you can't have more than one window open on the desktop, so if you forget passwords or like the IP, you have to keep going back and forth or write it down. And for the love of god, the command prompt you're given literally only accepts the command for the direct file, rather than you know, listing files, going to directories, things that a normal terminal console would give.... There's way better hacking simulators or games on steam that don't make you feel like a complete skiddie and with actual entertaining stories that don't talk down to you.Also, more points taken off for breaking in the middle of the pong-game loading."
17,2635,r/masterhacker
18,2633,Hack Games are nice for me !Great Game!!!
19,2626,Good but short
20,2623,you can't switch of music!!!you can't move the windows. That would be a basic featuremany un-clickable menus and buttons.
21,2623,its not bad got bored quite fast but overall not bad
22,2621,Honestly not really that great. The GUI is pretty bad and the tutorials sometimes don't explain things so you are stuck for a good while. I found many bugs that made the game crash the last time I played it. Honestly its a good idea for a game though I don't think its worth $4
23,2621,"I bought this game for like 1.5$ so I won't complain a lot nor I won't waste my time writing a detailed review for this game.This game is bad in too many cases, actually there are so many wrong things that I won't be able to talk about em all.Buy it, play for an hour, see how bad it is and give it back. The reason I am writing this review is, please don't let this game make you think that hacking games are . I played lots of hacking/programming games and this is far worse then the second worst game."
24,2618,"Overall very meh. They get points for realism, but lose them all in gameplay that gets stale quick.Worth the price but maybe not your time."
25,2614,that's my game
26,2610,Not recommended. It's like a typing simulator lol. Suited for wasting a few hours of time. That's all.
27,2609,A badly done clone
28,2603,"Just doesn't work.  1st mission is impossible, capital letters in console is a nono, entirely memory with commands, no copy-paste.  Garbage Russian game that wasn't tested at all."
29,2597,Very easy game. I finished it but didn't like it at all. Don't buy and waste your time.
30,2596,"Uh oh, I thought it was a hacking game but it's just a ""game"" where you follow instructions. No brain needed. One huge flaw with hack_me is that the so called hacker you play as doesn't even have a notepad on his ""computer"".Poorly designed. Poorly translated. Ridiculous price tag. Will ask for refund. Yeah I know, it's just 4 bucks, but it's so bad that it's not even worth a single buck.There are good hacking games available, and hack_me is clearly NOT one of them."
31,2588,"This is NOT worth even $0.99, let alone $3.99Overall a terrible game, there is a reason people don't like it. When you start up the game, seconds into playing it asks you to type in a full IP address. Once that message closes, you better hope you wrote it down or memorized it, because you can NEVER see that message again.Even further with issues, you have no control. It's like watching a YouTube video, but you have to remember all that garbage. Its barely even a game at this point. It crashes constantly, and when you close the game, your progress has a 50/50 chance of vanishing. Overall a horrible game, and feels completely unfinished. Don't play this garbage. Just go watch YouTube or something."
32,2582,I really like this game..
33,2582,"This game was alright. Took less than an hour to play, little bit of plot. The idea behind it was met, but it was a bit disappointing. I don't regret playing it, but it was kinda a waste of time."
34,2582,This game is fantastic!
35,2582,Great Game
36,2576,"Fun. Kind of short. If you pay five bucks for a game, you'll get your money's worth but not much else."
37,2563,ITS 
38,2559,"You know, I can't really recommend this game. I bought it while it was with a good discount, and I thought it was one of those good hacking games, like Hacknet. It's not.The game suffers from some bugs, and if you don't write the important stuff down, like IPs, you need to restart to the last checkpoint. It's made in Construct 2, and it looks like an incomplete flash game. I couldn't even pass the Tutorial, since the game wasn't letting me use UpperCase Letters. If you have patience and some sticky notes, you can give it a try if you haven't got any other games. His sequel learned a lot from the first one, adding the option to copy important messages and hear a cool small soundtrack ingame. But still, it just lacks that extra polish and bug testing. Also, the email app in this game is just a screenshot of Gmail in Russian.I believe this could have been a great game, but it just needed some polish. But it's a great game to have on your Hacking Shelf."
39,2557,"this game is gud , but sometimes I get confused because the the bad english translation .and sometimes it little bit buggybut yea this game not bad , i like this game :) #Fsociety:)"
40,2556,this game in a nutshells in kind of ass
41,2555,Too easy and does not have any guns.  I was told this was like call of duty.  More like call of nothing.  Empty and even more empty.  It was very difficult and too easy.  There were too many guns to choose from.  I've been jonny on the spot.
42,2555,"Short interesting game, i like it."
43,2549,5/10
44,2543,"Unforunately the german keyboard is not supportet so I am unable to type backslashes  just normal slashes that don't work.Tried every combination of buttons with shift, alt, altGr, ctrl, rightshift + signs,numbers,letters etc. but couldn't figure it out.I'd recomment to add a 'on-screen'-keyboard to enable input via mouseclicks at the bottom of the screen.____Ok, now the game is fun  !"
45,2539,"interface has many buttons that don't work, very frustrating"
46,2536,"Complete and absolute trash.Cons:-Weird UI.-Limited possibilities.-Only one window open at a time.-Even tho I selected English at the beginning there's tons of russian words and buttons scattered around.-Being a bit nitpicky but the grammar is bad at times.-A lot of misdirecting buttons on every program that doesn't do anything other than confuse you by being there.-No way of backtracking, clicking away new info too fast and it's gone.-In some menus, pressing ESC will leave you with a ""back to game"" only, no quit or ""back to main menu"" option.-Quit the game instantly when I had to play a game of ""Ball brick breaker"" and it got stuck bouncing horizontally from left to right endlessly.Pros:Sadly none.Conclusion:Do not buy unless you wish to waste money.Sad : ("
47,2534,The game is fun at some points. But a couple of times it feels like they did things just to expand playtime.Like when it took about 1 or 2 hours for a number to get to 500000.I did like the concept though.
48,2534,THE TRYPING SIMULATORindie and kinda fun
49,2533, Deborah de Luca @ Chteau de Chambord for Cercle    : / :    ]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEbrvMljMCg
50,2531,cool game but i stopped playing
51,2531,"this game doesn't connected to real life at all. thout, there will be some IT challanges... but found very weak realization of unreal things with lots of mistakes: ip address is a integer from 10000 to 99999 so as a port number. this is sucks."
52,2531,This game is literally aids and thats alot coming from me.
53,2529,awful
54,2528,"easy game, 100% in less than an hour"
55,2526,good game
56,2522,"no copy paste text, no multitasking if you forget something you have to restart the entire level"
57,2521,"impossible to play  just as i enter the first mission, i am asked to write ""D:\documents\bank\logpass.txt"" the problem? it counts the shift key as a void key and only makes it sound in-game, without applying the changes that key implies like writing in uppercase or extra characters (it's not the same to put ""D:"" or to put ""d.""). for some reason, the ""\"" works just fine even if i have to use two keys to write it, but still, without being able to write uppercase or extra characters, the game is simply impossible unless i hack it (and i know not how to hack a game like that)"
58,2521,"Dude, the game is practically unplayable. I am sorry, but it has some seriouis bugs needing to be fixed, like on stage 3 when I press enter on a fully correct input on the 2nd program and it doesn't go past ""Checking login"" to even say it is incorrect, or stage 4 when the password will never enter."
59,2521,"It killed some time!It has some bugs. It had some spelling errors.Plus I liked the fact that I had to chose ""American"" as a launguage :)6/10"
60,2520,yes
61,2520,"Little and a short hacking simulation game. I bought the hack_me collection bundle when it was 1 euro, and it was really worth it. But, before I really decide if this game is the most better one, I need to try all other hacking simulation games on Steam. I will start with hack_me 2.10/10"
62,2520,JUST BAD!!!
63,2515,good game
64,2513,game 
65,2511,nice
66,2510,"I typically enjoy hacking games, but this feels terribly broken. I wanted to like this game. I really wanted to."
67,2509,Not worth 4 euro...
68,2508,"it's bad, as in REALLY BAD"
69,2508,I like this game because this is very fake had a great time with my friends debunking all of this stuff :D
70,2508,"Nice game, but don't play it with a mechanical keyboard"
71,2508,Super short and monotonous
72,2505,"I feel this game could be amazing, but it is missing key details throughout the game. I think that if you dont have an idea about hacking you will be lost and not be able to continue along through the levels. The fact that when you know what to do it doesnt let you go through the steps unless it is exactly how the game runs. I further think that you shouldnt purchase this game unless you really understand hacking."
73,2505,FIRST TIME MY  STUCK IN THE TOASTER WASTE OF TIME
74,2504,GOOD GAME the game gives you feeling like hacker 10/10
75,2504,"WOULD NOT RECCOMEND.hack_me looked really cool at first. The name draws you in, and the snapshots look cool. But you can see something is wrong when you look at the video(s). The videos are just the first segment of gameplay! You would expect a game chraging your hard-earned money to at least have a trailer. If this didn't convince you to turn back, wait for the gameplay.Tee gameplay is glitchy and confusing. At times I had to look up guides because I acedentally missed a dialouge box or numbers don't match. Also, the graphics. The widows almost all use the same white-and-purple color pallete, and nothing looks polished. It looks like someone went into MS Paint and used a bunch of the shapes to make something resembling a computer window.And one thing that really annoyed me through my ten minutes of enjoying the game was the windows themselves. I can't move them around, and when I close a folder containing something open, it close that too! I can't even type in a text file! Most of the windows feel like cruddy .PNGs that someone put in a game and said, ""Meh. Good enough.""Long story short, do not buy this game. It is unfinished, and would be expected of a sixth-grade coding class."
76,2503,    P.S.   =3
77,2503,"Play video, Wont Redirect you, will play on profile <3https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0ii3Tcz6a8"
78,2502,buggy game; don't pay more than $0.2
79,2502,
80,2501,"I thought hack_me was an okay game. I got the game for a discounted price of eighty cents, but I wouldn't say the game is worth four dollars. I think I have a bit of a neutral input on this game, maybe around 5/10 stars. It's a bit short for its original price with one to two hours of gameplay. If you get bothered or bored rather easily, this might not be a good game for you as it can likely get repetitive to those who are. I personally enjoyed the game and I am glad I got it for the price I did, but for all you other people, I reccomend you not to spend your money on this unless you really feel like it'd be a great game (or if you also get a really good discount). In the end, this game's worth $0-$1 in my own opinion. Whether you enjoy the game or not is based upon how much you bought it for and how your own personality corresponds with the content and gameplay, if that makes sense."
81,2500,"This game sucks,it's only a ""computer"" gameon where you need to hack somebodyand, is all russian,i want refund."
82,2500,Really fun game and totally recommend it! I just wish it was a bit longer.
83,2499,"-The so called ""h4ck1ng"" is a little silly but its a fun game if you crave more of the ""un-named show"" that happens to have many similarities to events and characters in this game.-It's a neat pretend, no-harm no-foul atmosphere where you can imagine you are ""un-named protaganist"" from ""popular h4ck3 tv show"".-It has a few trophies and trading cards. It's short and sweet.Mostly a once or twice play through."
84,2499,"Lots of bugs, bugs and bugs.Do not buy it yet.-1/10"
85,2499,"When I first saw It I thought it would be a nice programming game but in reality it's terrible. Graphics are bad, awful story, bad scripted missions. This game is so bad that I will never play it ever again"
86,2498,absolute maximum garbage
87,2498,"This game is interesting.Pros:   It's a nice looking hacking simulation  The music is nice  If your looking for a short game, this is it.Cons:  It's pretty linear  The English is pretty bad (it might be better in other languages)I beat it in one hour, but I used this walkthough https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=836608393.Overall I enjoyed it and I would recommend it (expecially since the price is so cheap)."
88,2495,"Game is poorly designed, full of bugs, the english translation (i guess translated from russian) is as well full of mistakes and typos and the story behind the game is . As well you basically do the same things over and over again and if u are dumb enough to fail at this (besides bugs where you have to restart a level sometimes), you can always look in the top right corner to see what to do next. Luckyly i bought this on a sale for -80%. Would not recommend!"
89,2494,good game
90,2494,"Worst hacking game in the books. The game is broken as hell, to the point that you can't play the game. 0/10."
91,2492,hack_me ..... very good quality; only programmer prefers videogame ...... good sound.
92,2492,"I played through this game in one sitting, it was mildly amusing to begin with but there is very little the player can do. To write a virus you mash keys as fast as you can to pass the time, and unfortunatly the mini games are bugged. I will be trying out hack_me 2, because this game did have some interesting concepts that I believe with more work could make the game more fun, more user interaction and choice ratehr than following a limited story line."
93,2491,i really think the game itself woudn't be that bad but most of the time it is unplayable because of bugs...
94,2491,"Nice game, cool contente and fun story by the way."
95,2491,"0/10Totally buggy, Ingame keyboard is a mess, you cannot finish the game because wifi password in chapter 4 is always wrong. You need to write down every comand because your virtual-pc is not able to have more than one window open at once.Shame on you developers. Instead of finishing/fixing hack_me you already released hack_me 2. You are a great example for a company trying to release games as fast as possible to make some money and don't care about quality in games.Guys don't buy that game until it has an discount of 100%."
96,2490,"Probably one of the worst 'hacking games' for it's price.The game is boring, poorly translated, stupidly over-the-top and not challenging at all.I bought the game in a bundle when the game was -80% off, I'm glad I didn't buy it at it's full price tag."
97,2489,"Unless you have extremely great memory and like to press your keyboard for random things for about forever, I wouldn't recommend this."
98,2488,an extremely short game with a horrible story to it.
99,2487,OwKay xD
100,2487,The game is very intuitive the only problem being the price. You get games such as Endless Sky that are free-to-play with a ton of work put into it and should be praised a lot. And then you get this game which is not free-to-play and costs you your hard earned money in my opinion is is garbage and not worth buying at all. Also if there was more content I could definitely see a change in my opinion but for now it still remiains the same.[PLEASE DO NOT BUY!]
101,2486,binary
102,2483,"Badly developed game. Very buggy. Forces you to memorize passwords and addresses. Instructions appear only once so if you forgot something you have to restart mission. Lost potential here.It would be good candidate as Game Jam winner, but it's not ready for Steam."
103,2483,"Sh**tiest game ever.  No flexibility, just press buttons and make double clicks... Stu*id and no-sense-making story.I wouldn't recommend to buy this """"""""""GAME"""""""""" to anyone.  The guys who recommend it even confuse between Linux and Windows!"
104,2481,"Really? You cannot copy or paste or read instructions again. And you ""hack"" the bank by just inserting a password you get? And ""bruteforce"" by clicking on a button, or ""hacking"" a pc by inserting the name into a program? Thats not hacking, thats pressing your left mouse button"
105,2479,"Bad game, not flexible, has no real aim and is too plain, not worth the buy."
106,2478,Very intresting game.It learn you the way of hacking in a very basic level. The OS is like linux or maybe Windows xp. Generally i recommend to buy it.
107,2478,Game can be buggy sometimes and make sure you write down the steps before you close the tutorial window because you can not reopen it.
108,2478,"Extremely linear, boring and not challenging - waste of time."
109,2478,It's a good game at least for its price. But don't look for something like Hacknet.
110,2478,I learned how to hack GG. Worth the price.
111,2478,"This game can do nothing to you with storytelling.I mean, at the end, the kidnappers release Elena, and Elena says ""We'll never see each other again."" for god sake, I got confused!Did they kill her and lied to us? Did they forced her to not hack anymore? Did Elena hate you? What the flying Frisk!Also, you can open 2 or more programs, but that is only for SOME programs.You can't control the chat, it is random (for me), or extremely hard to control.The game becomes repeatant at some point (chat quests), you won't learn any new hacking ways.Some programs come when it is needed. WHAT THE FRISK DEVELOPER, YOU CAN JUST MAKE IT STAY!Pros:Somewhat cool virus codingCons:Disappearing programsBad storytellingBad storyRepeatativeKeyboard input is not the same as the game output.Conclusion:DONT BUY THIS GAME. I JUST BOUGHT IT BECAUSE IT'S TRADING CARDS ARE TOO CHEAP."
112,2478,"Srsly, this game is bugged as hell, but, i got the hacker aura while im playin' it"
113,2477,really crappy. I've seen better games On Scratch. not worth time.
114,2477,Terrible interface
115,2476,If hacking was this easy Anonymous would be ruling the world already.
116,2475,"Looks like a flash game, plays like a flash game. And a bad one at that. Completely unpolished, russian language leftovers everywhere.  Yuck. Horrendous game."
117,2474,"This game is bad but not unplayable. I'm giving it a negative review because of the fact that this game is pitifully short if you know what you're doing you can finish it in 50 minutes.EDIT:just remembered this I have a couple of questions for y'all:1. Do you like to press keys for no damn reason to make a ""hack""? If yes than get out. Also this game is for you!2. this isn't a question I just really hate this game. It isn't fun, the plot is non-exsistant, and not to mention if you forget anything than guess what, YOU CAN'T PLAY THIS DAMN GAME!Don't buy this trash.EDIT 2:Like I mentioned in the first ""question"" to code a hack you have to mash your keys on your keyboard. The second hack you have to code takes two literal minutes of solid key mashing and worst yet you can't hold down a key to code quickly. I'm not going to edit anymore this game is trash not worth it and you shouldn't buy it."
118,2472,"Not for everybody, it is obvious to see the hated comments. It is more than a puzzle game..."
119,2472,"Fantastic idea but very very poorly executed.To say the game lacks polishing would be an immense understatement. The creators are displaying the empathy level of a rock and there is no love of detail. Immersion is almost non existent. It'd have been relatively easy to introduce the game's concepts in a much cleverer way and to improve the GUI. Noone is expecting fancy graphics in such a title, a hacking game should be, by default, about something else. In the current state it's crap. I'd be interested in the concept though if a clone would comes out which would be created with the proper love such a project deserves."
120,2471,extremely difficult but fun!
121,2469,its meh... really short but its ok
122,2468,"U,,N;"
123,2467,Still no keyboard layout fix.
124,2467,"Meh, It's worth $2 tops. This is a game that I had semi-high expectations for and ended up being a disappointment. It could be a bit longer too. It took me just under an hour to beat it. Boring."
125,2467,y
126,2467,:(
127,2466,Bad game...There is only 10-20 missions. The game is too easy. Good for easy acievements. Good for money waster. When you get in the game there is almost no plot at all4/10-Bad Game overall
128,2466,"I bought this on sale really cheap just to support the development of the idea, because it sounds like a good one, but the execution of it is very very poor. It's actually unplayable. I literaly can't get pass the tutorial because the key you press on the keyboard doesn't match the one that shows up on the screen. It's impossible for me to type : for instance, and the symbols / and \ are not the same as the physical keyboard. Which makes it impossible for me to type ""D:/Documents/Bank/logpass.txt"" and go on with the story.Also it simulates a Windows XP envoiroment, but you can't move the windows around the screen, so basically you have to Alt-Tab the game and make notes on notepad about the thing you have to do, or memorize everything. I'm not a potato at memorizing, but I think not everyone will be able to memorize a full profile or an IP address on the spot like that.Hope devs patch it somehow."
129,2465,"Pretty rough game, kinda buggy and boring."
130,2465,i dont really know much about the game as if you know little about hacking it is unplayable as the instruteons are lackluster and can't be re-vewed after
131,2465,Complete garbage.
132,2465,I hope hack_me 3 will come out soon! It was a great game! Uploaded it on YT! Check me out @Gage Sweet
133,2465,"nunca conseguia salvar o progre;o, e divertido mas deixa a desejar em muitas areas como a multi janelas do windos explore, programas, emails, e a falta de  um save point ja que nem todos conseguem gravar um IP em apenas um segundo"
134,2465,"Dont buy thisI bought this cause i thought, well its on discount what can go wrong. Everything.If you forget something Restart"
135,2464,    
136,2464,"Even though it was really cheap, i wouldn't recommend it.- The fact that i can't move the windows or use the CTRL+C and CTRL+V shortcuts is really annoying, since you always have to keep remembering nonsense passwords and web URLs.- There are some bugs that are game breaking, like the Wi-Fi login one.- It's boring. You're doing the same things all the time. I've played it only for an hour (then Idle Master XD), but i always was told to use only those 3 hacking methods."
137,2464,"Feels like this game would've been used to stage those hacking scenes in movies. Not convincing, though. Not that fun as I thought it would be also."
138,2463,It's the basic game to hack through the world
139,2463,"Totaly waste of money+trading cards and achivements+Nice badges+Quick ending-poorly designed-Nothing to do with hacking (except if you thing script kiddos are considered as hackers)- at 40% of game you will reading messenges and at 20% you will mash keys to write "" cmd scripts"" or replying on messenges.- No minimize,drag and drop,copy-paste...... and 99% of anything else in windows enviroment dosnt work.2/10"
140,2463,Better then LoL.
141,2463,"Given the discount, I've bought this little game where you're an hacker, trying to take down big corporations. No, I'm kidding, in reality, you're just doing stuff to please others without real plot, even if there is a try at it.It's hard to say that some missions are just reading mail and nothing else (you can see that when you're selecting chapters). Seriously, while I understand the need to divide the game in episodes for the weak plot, it would be great to have divided chapters in real ones.There is also a major bug in the first mission for people with AZERTY keyboards: the backslash (\) and the colon (:) aren't working.... well, to be more accurate, it's mapped without any sense (due to the engine apparently). I found the corresponding keys: SHIFT + $ for : and  for \.Anyway, while it's kinda enjoying using available tools, there is also a major flaw: the fact that you need to touch a key for the game to write ""virus"" or ""chat answers"". One by one. So, if it's was short stuff, it's not annoying but you have one long part and after that, it's tricky to exit.While the graphics aren't bad, you're just in a virtualized Windows. The music was perhaps the strongest point of the game, even if it's the same track, but well, I enjoyed it.And well, should I mention that sometimes, selecting a chapter will end up in black screen or deformed screens?hack_me is void of options. It could have been a good game if only more efforts were put for the plot and for varying missions. People complained about Hacker Evolution, yet, Hacker Evolution was much versed into a real challenge than hack_me.True, hack_me with a 80% discount is perhaps a good deal, after all, there are wallpapers AND trading cards AND achievements. But for the full price, it's just a game you should avoid. In other words, while I've enjoyed some parts of it, I can't really recommend it. I will probably buy hack_me 2 but not at full price."
142,2463,"Came here looking for an Hacknet-like game. It wasn't that. You're only allowed to put in what the game asks of you. Not at all a sandbox game or whatever. Not really to my liking, but that's just my 2 cts."
143,2463,"DO NOT BUY. The so called game is a bunch of scripted tasks in pseudo-windows environment that is neither fun nor educative, and looks like hastily slapped together mspaint drawings. Usability issues start to boggle you since the very start of the tutorial - it tells you to input an IP-address that is nowhere to be found after you close the tutorial memo. It was the bloody game restart for me just to reread the tutorial and write down the address with pen and paper!Then, the plot is non-existent, the icons and buttons are really small and unresponsive, the interface is lame altogether. I played like 11 minutes and decided that it would be my first refund, despite grabbing this ""game"" at 80% discount. That's really THAT bad."

147,2462,"TL;DR: A 15yo could have written a better ""game"" than this. AVOID this time waster garbage(even with the 80% off sale currently; not worth it)-----Pros:- Can't think of any, except for the Steam achievements and cards  (if you don't mind ~1.5hrs of boredom hell to get them)Cons: (long list but will try and surmise it here)- Full screen, low res; can't be changed- Blatant rip-off of Mr Robot's signature logo- A bad imitation of the excellent Hacknet/Uplink games- Poor English language throughout- Tedious typing throughout of net addresses- Auto-written chat msgs, virus code (<- dribble) by spamming randomly the keyboard for each char typed- Tons of basic network errors, e.g. not hex MAC addresses, numeric TCP IP's with port counts over 65K etc etc- Two mini-games which won by randomly spamming the keyboard- Linear progression; I've seen power-point presentations more interactive than this- Many more little things, which I won't even bother listing2/10"

149,2462,''Negative''
150,2462,"This game was honestly one of the worst games I've played. I have played flash games that had more flavor in 10 minutes than this game had in 100. It just seemed too damn unrealistic and boring and the ""gameplay"" was outright nonexistent. It had a lot of moments where you just wait just to pad out the time and possibly go past the refund mark. I'm pretty sure if I really wanted to I could make a game like this in a boring saturday afternoon. I didn't sign up for a ""Press a bunch of rAndom keys to l00k c00l!!!! xddddddd"" simulator, I wanted to play a game that was fun, challenging, and well, a GAME. I tried to tolerate this dump in which all you do is click this, type this website, click this, type that but the moment when I decided ""No,  this , I'm out"" is when you ""make"" a virus and have to wait until 500K people join to DDOS a website. It's so  dumb and took forever to load. I checked the tip thing at the side and it told me I could play a minigame. Woowee that sounds tolerable. But no, that was already too high of an expectation. It was a ""problem"" you have to solve in which you just read it backwards and type in the date this game was created.  really? I decided to go away for 20 minutes and talk with my friends about how  of a game this was when I checked back and noticed I was in the minigame. That's fine, I clicked out. BUT NOPE, THE DOWNLOADS WAS STUCK THE WHOLE 20 MINUTES. It was  aggravating and this basically meant I had to wait even longer and I just couldn't take it. I'm sorry but I will be refunding this game before I even finish it. This will leave a bad taste in my mouth for a while.TL:DR This game is ""hacker voice im in: the game"" and wasted 20 minutes of my life"
151,2462,"this ""game"" offers rather a really really bad  attempt at showing off how hollywood might look like.also the game seems to be merely a javascript. it ""plays"" like a powerpoint presentation.don't even buy it for a single dollar/euro like i did.- horrible english language- horrible UI (can't move windows; also need to close a programm before re-opening a different one; font, pictures, dialog boxes...)- non-intuitive UI (found out there is some hint for the next step in the top right corner very late)- annoying music- scenarios are all pretty similar- very short- every step is pre-scripted and feels dull"
152,2462,"Brilliant game, I had a lot of fun playing it."
153,2462,Cool and exciting hacking simulator. It's more better than simulators in GameMaker engine from Google Play. Soon i will buy hack_me 2 ;D
154,2462,"I bought the game, ""played"" a few levels and then I requested my refund.Like, this game is super bad, to start with most of the translation work is bad things like ""You device"" and much more are common in this game, 99% of the community is Russian so I am sure the developers did not care about the other people playing this game.And this game is about reading, clicking and remembering, you get a password or a website that you have to remember and the ""code"" is just randomly pressing keys on your keyboard."
155,2462,"Can't write captial letters or things like ""\"" , ""/"" , "":"" etc cause a german keyboard. Sorry, I was really exited for this game, but thats a refund"
156,2462,Terrible
157,2462,Nope.Not even close
158,2462,this gaem is awesome an i like it a lot but id wish a spanish keyboard configuration for the game
159,2462,"The game is rather a joke about hacking than a hacking simulator. You are literally pressing any keys (like they do it in the movies) blindly to hack someone's computer. Funny indeed, but doesn't really fall into the 'simulation' category at all. Also the game basically guides you onto the next objectives, further oversimplifying the gameplay.OK for casual gamers wishing to dive into the 'hacking' theme, but for those who are looking for some hardcore experience and puzzles -- keep looking."

I think if they are wanting the game to develop and get better that they go back to basics and rehaul the game as there are too many negatives to try and come back from this.For this reason I give this game a 3/10Miniman_Andy"

252,2453,"holy heck what is the point of this game? what compelled this person to develop such schlock, and what personality disorder is to blame? what made him sit down, develop this mess out, and then release it on steam? was there a grand plan? what type of positive reviews was he expecting?because by the looks of this game, its sheer precarity in scope, it does not seem that he will get many at all, at least not enough to gratify his inanity."
253,2453,"A hacking game is truly brilliant when you can't get 5 minutes in because she said 'Type connect 23.128.117.34(or someother number)' and then you can't because the prompt is closed and you can no longer find that number anywhere in the game. This game is also poorly designed, it gives the illusion of using a hacker's desktop only for the immersion to be ruined by how the programs and folders work when you interact with them. This game needs more improvement and cannot be compared to other games like Hacknet."
254,2453,Completed The Game In 50 Minutes. Worth The Money Right Now? No. If They Add More Content To The Game And Put In More Missions? Yes. Right Now The Game Has 15 Missions? Don't Get Me Wrong They Were Challenging But They Weren't Impossible And For A $5/ 2.50 Game 15 Missions? That's Not A Lot! I Was Hoping For More Like 70-80 Missions. If The Game Had Been 0.70 or $1.50 Then I Would Say Get It Now But For As It Stands Right Now. It's A Good Game But Needs More Content.
255,2453,Nope
256,2453,"I couldn't even play this game for a long time because it started to piss me off too much. The tutorial is terrible, and you're not really doing anything, just following instructions and typing in commands that the game gives you (that you can't see again because once you close the tutorial window they're gone for good.)The aforementioned commands don't even have any footing in reality, either. You connect to other systems using a 'connect' command, which obviously isn't how things work outside of Source games. You can't do ls/dir in order to get any information about the directory you're in. You can't do cd, you just type in full file paths. File paths that are completely arbitrary, as the directories leading up to them don't exist. The game has made no attempt to emulate a window manager, and no attempt to base itself in even a vaguely realistic terminal setting.Seriously, cd, dir, and a directory structure of some form should at least exist before you try and call yourself a hacking simulator. Even games like Uplink, a TERRIBLY (and deliberately, to be fair) inaccurate hacking simulator had these things.Don't waste your time."
257,2453,i got confuse alot and the tutorial isn't helping either
258,2453,ive done the intire game its ok but im on a massive cliff hanger
259,2453,its so bad ! a game about hacking that dont support diffrent keyboards (contry layouts)so i cant type in the basic commands that i need to progress..I if you want a hacker sim go and pick up Hack mud or Hacknet1/10
260,2453,Ok you might look at the trailer and think wow this game looks fun but the 1st was only fun the rest of them where  horrible take my word please don't buy this game it is so bad don't let the pics trick you take the comments word for it DONT  BUY IT
261,2453,"Very clunky interface.  Windows won't move, so you need to remember tiny details or write it all down.  Overall not a fun game."
262,2453,"This game has a bad UI, but it's also a decent game. and it's priced very reasonably. so. I have no complaints. it's a good time consumer."
263,2453,tutorial is pretty badyou have to write down what she says cause you cant bring it back upit should have a better tutorial to explain how to do certain task before putting you on your own like that
264,2453,garbage
265,2453,Very much so a POS game. If you miss one popup which tells you exactly how to play the game then you have to restart the whole section.
266,2453,it didnt even fully work
267,2453,"Unclear instrctons, frustratingly specific commands that you have to type without reference (you have to write ANY commands your assistant tells you down before you close the in game window) and typing doesn't even work sometimes in the CMD. This was all in the first mission to! I find this not worthy of a place on the popular new releases section I found it on."
268,2453,"I tried to play this game, I really did. But I had to literally restart the tutorial 5 times just to get through the first step, simply because the ""Hints"" don't return after one showing. Maybe in the future, with some updates, it could be mended, but right now it's not worth the money."
269,2453,"Horrible game, I've enjoyed hacking games and im quite into programming myself, this game is done horribly, the tabs cannot be moved, the tutorial is freaking . the game for some reason is in russian(half of it). Please do not waste your money on this garbage."
270,2453,"To start off, the game is very buggy; many times keys would not register as being pressed. The tutorial stopped after entering the bank account and skipped to the ""after x years heading"". The windows cannot be resized or minimized for easy multi-tasking. Copy and paste is not a feature, which would allow everything to flow and be played more smoothly. 3/10 Improvement greatly needed"
271,2453,This is !
272,2453,"I would rather castrate myself with a dull knife than finishing this game.No but really, its awful. Simple IT commands arent in the game and once you've read a tutorial there is no way of getting it back besides replaying the entire tutorial."
273,2453, 
274,2453,"well here we go...The game (at least for me) is fundamentally broken and loaded with bugs.I have played this game exactly 19 minutes, and i already dont want to play any more.I had to restart the game around 5 times and still had the same bugs. I couldnt make any progress.It IS Early acces, but for me it makes no difference, as almost every f*cking game is Early Acces. When am i ever going to see a full, complete game on Steam again? Sigh. There should be a bottomline on how far the game should be developed before even going Early Acces. Such a shame. If i could have just played this game from end to finish i wouldnt be moaning right now BUT I SIMPLY CANNOT. Would have been a great experience. Requested refund. Never gonna buy again. For everyone thinking to buy this game, just wait for a year or 2 until it enters beta or even release, cuz for early acces there just isnt a lot as what the game's direction is. It fundamentally is a small, small game. Dislike this review all you want but im just being honest about this game."
275,2453,u cant even minimize tabs or look at the objective the b itch only says it once u cant copy paste
276,2453,i dont can push this button in the game : plz anywan help me sorry for my bad langue
277,2453,"Tutorial made me refund this game. Do not recommend. I really enjoy hacking games, but this is not properly done hacking game."
278,2453,i liked this game very much but i still gave it a negative review since most of the game is only typing and waiting. some people like this but as a person that is used to fast paced games it was pretty boring. i do want to say that it is pretty fun but starts to repeat itself after a while.*small spoiler incoming* What i also notest is that in chapter 2 ep 4 you have to wait very very long for a program to hit a sertain number and just before it was done loading the game crashed on me so i had to wait again. this was the point for me to return the game and as of writing this review im waiting to get my money back(with i almost couldn't do beacause of the 2 hour limit and the very long waiting)i hoped this helped you and have a good day
279,2453,"1) Keep a pad of paper by your desk, the game gives you some information ONE TIME with no option to go back and get it again!2) The command line is FAKE! The whole game seems to be similar: smoke and mirrors.It honestly has potential and perhaps it will look and play much better in the future but right now, I simply cannot reccomend the game."
280,2453,played itwell it feels like you are hacking for realand there are some basic knowledge rto learnPS: well i think its possible the game has alternate ending depending on what our choices
281,2453,"This game made me contemplate suicide. Tutorial is terrible, Windows don't stack, and you have to write down most things. Getting a refund."
282,2453,"This game is awful!1. Could be made in MS paint2. Tells you to do something then never tells you how to do it ever again. Seriously, 1 line of text then gone!3. Doing exactly what it tells me to do on the FIRST LEVEL and still not working.4. Without the needless difficulty, the game would be done in 10-15 minutes.I'm done with this game"
283,2453,why does the game crash and so many glitches this is impossible to play when the game crashes
284,2453,"Well i gotta say, bought it around 3 euros, its funny and fine to play tho, your top right corner instruct you all the time, nice and good story, ONLY im wondering how it ends, it has around 3 chapters and after that it STOPS, CHAPTER 3 level 4 anyone who knows how to surpass it? i dont i played it for an hour or so, and really im getting irritated thanks to the fact that the game is, weird AF no im serious really weird, make different endings as welldont buy this game above 2 euros, NOT worth your money"
285,2453,"I was really happy to see this game, it seemed like lots of fun!... but than it turned out really bad.-Sometimes you see a text just to never see it again, so you have to restart the mission or make a screenshot to reread the text-You can only have 1 window open!-really bad formatting and english-keyboard sometimes doesn't work at all-other gamebreaking bugs and glitchesIt seems like a great game but it has to be fixed first"
286,2453,"Way too linear. Can't skip the ""hacking"" step and just use the password when you replay levels."
287,2453,Super boring. This game is not fun.
288,2453,"I'm not even sure I can call this a game.The immersion is lost on the fact that it 'fakes' very little of the applications it uses.  It's basically just a point and click picture adventure, there's no real skill involved.The fact that you can't emulate a proper windows environment really does it in.  Have details on a supposed password?  Hope you brought a pen and paper, because the emulated environment doesn't allow you to resize the windows and keep that nugget of information on screen.The narrator would be better served if they pretended it was a skype session of sorts and you were sharing your screen.  Just a magical window showing up (from a so-called hacker), that you can't bring back up once you dismiss it, doesn't help.If the hacker was that capable they could do the work themselves (or better yet, program a bot to do the work for them.)"

292,2452,"awesome game, woth the money, enjoyed t a lot."
293,2452,"=TL;DR=+ Story and theme: 13/37 (jk, I'd give it a 9/10)+ Mechanism and gameplay: 1/10 due to lots of issues + early access.Come back when the game is fully developed. The game has potential but right now it's pretty disappointing, sorry.======== Pros =+ Decent story (despite being short)+ Pretty well-themed for that hacker feeling (the keystroke and mouse click sound)+  Intriguing and fun to play for people into and not into IT.+ ""One windows reinstall later...""= Cons =+ Figuring out the controls for this game is even harder than doing the real thing itself.   Tutorial is even harder and more annoying than the minigames.+ the log-in screen does not match with the OS (clearly Windows 7 or later but log-in screen is Windows XP, lol)+ You can do anything You can't do a lot of things.    You can't right click, can't copy-paste, you can't even drag/drop windows or open multiple ones at a time.    In short, you can't do a lot of things that you normally can when you mess around with the OS (yet).    Also, you can type lots of stuffs in cmd other than just ""connect [IP Address]"" like in the tutorial.    The thing is that the game doesn't let the player experiment / play around with the environment (just for now, I guess).+ The typing mechanism is pretty silly. So, you basically just mash your keyboard randomly to ""type"" out anything in the game. I understand that you aren't allowed to type anything invalid, but there is a better approach to this.+ there are many many bugged parts (must be due to Early Access).   E.g. sometimes when the player faces the request in the email, declining that request would send them onto the next chapter rather than progressing the game with that choice.+ The music seems okay at first, but gets boring and tiring to hear pretty quickly. (And there aren't any options to mute the music)    Not to mention how the music play-back is bugged if you return to the main menu and pick a different chapter or start a new game, the music might be played twice at the same time (I almost got a headache from that)    Better yet, there aren't even options to change the game from fullscreen -> windowed -> windowed full, etc.= Suggestions  (other than fixing the persisting bugs) =+ There should be a setting menu to change the music/ sfx volume, languague, screen resolution, everything.For the typing mechanism:+ Letting the player know what they're supposed to type could be an approach.   There could be a block of faded text showing what's supposed to be there. The player can type anything they want, as well as being able to use function keys like Ctrl, Shift, Enter, Delete, etc.BUT,  the game would only advance if everything was typed correctly, else alert the player with a text box or something like ""Oops, something isn't right."".For customization:+ The current wallpapers are a-okay, tho. I have nothing against them. But if the player can change the wallpaper, that'd be awesome. + There should be an option to choose or play your custom music, like, REAL sound files in your system (kinda like an option to import / locate the music folder in your computer).In short, since this is game is gonna be a simulation, it'd be amazing if the player felt like they're hacking with their own OS other than just playing a game.Welp, that's it for now. Loads of issues.But don't get me wrong, tho. This game seems nice and I trust that it'd turn out to be awesome.Just, wait until it's fully developed."
294,2451,one of the best hacker imulators iv ever played
295,2451,Game stoped working on the 3rd mission 15 minutes into it so...i honestly have no idea if it is good since i cant play it...so will be giving this a negative review
296,2451,"I've never seen interface that terrible! Game is partly unplayable.Take the intro mission: tutorial text tells you the ip. It cannot be copied, you have to memorize or write it down manually somewhere. And no, this tutorial window won't pop up. Forgot the IP? Restart the tutorial. Most of the text cannot be copied in game as well. So better to have a second display to make a notes in Notepad, because it doesn't have any notepad in game.Interface itself is mostly a pictures (read - screenshots), including unclickable buttons, so even with english language it has russian text.Also windows cannot be moved and at the most of the time you cannot open a several applications.Oh and the tutorial isn't interesting at all. It forces you to type things for no reason. (I've played a lot of hacker sims where you have to type many things, but they offer the reason why is this necessary and interesting.)Early access, you say? I bet this game won't be better after release, as I don't see the potential here.Developers are obviously lazy. I'm greatly disappointed, sorry."
297,2451,"The game plays more like a visual novel, which would be fine if the story were at all interesting, but it isn't."
298,2451,"I believe you should give people a linux terminal because no-one hacks in a windows enviroment unless you are running a nessus scan. I dont like that I cant use capital letters, I cannot move the screen around at all, it doesnt function like a windows computer, thus I think it should all be in terminal. Anyone who is used to a windows display will get frustrated cause they cant use it exactly like a windows display. I like the art, it has the Mr.Robot feel but needs more polish and less read this and type that. Make it for people who actually like hacking. I can't recommend this game as it is because i don't like the linear direction its taking. Where do you do nmap scans? Anyways I know its in developement, just my opinions. I will keep my eye on it for updates."
299,2451,"""ls is an unknown command""""dir is an unknown command""If your in IT that should be enough to describe this game. Honestly the fact that at the time of writing this has 376 reviews and it's concidered Very Positive"" astounds me. Actually no, i find it down right suspect. To call the interface cluncky would be unfair to clunky interfaces, you cant have more than 1 window open at once, you cant copy paste anything, so your constantly having to remember urls to copy from one window into another, or your sitting there with notepad open in a seperate window typing it in there so you dont have to worry about remember it incorrectly. This game has nothing even close to hacking other than 'heres a bunch of programs, go run them against this target'. This game could be somewhat good if they bothered to at least TRY to emulate a decent OS enviroment but they havent even bothered to do that. Which at this early stage, i dont have high hopes for as its clear they havent actually tried to play or get someone to play their own game and give them feedback before releasing it on steam.Give this one a miss, there are plenty other hacking themed games out there that are a lot more realistic, not that it takes much."
300,2451," ,  .A short but interesting simulation game. There are 2 chapters for now, but the developers say theyre working on 3 new chapters at least. At the beginning the guide in the game teaches you how to do every step, but later you need to realize how to do some things by yourself."
301,2451,This game definitly has potential how ever it is to short only 2 chapters is short and i know you want to come ou with 5 chapters but hopefully it comes out soon
302,2451,"The game was truly fun and expansive. The only thing issue is that the linear gameplay. The unability to mulitask, open multiple programs or minimize the programs. But perhaps the most annoying bug is that he program would be unresponsive if the correct command is not entered"
303,2450,This game has so many bugs and the grammer sucks and I can't seem to make capital letters in the cmd and once the instructions are there and you press continue the instructions are never to be seen again. I suggest If yuo are planning to buy this game change plans until they fix the bugs!
304,2450,"Its not bad, but it gets boring easy and fast."
305,2450,A lot of things need to be fixed. At the mission where you hack wifi I could not enter the password received from the application. When you are asked to do something you need to put it on a paper since it is not saved in the game and once you close the window it is gone so you will have to start the stage all over again.
306,2450,Crashes Frequently
307,2449,"Very bad Game I played it for no time at all and realized how bad it was. Translation erroers I can deal with, but a  UI in a COMPUTER game is horrible. It's very much like an old game form the VERY early 2000s called Uplink, it's about 5 dollars more from GoG and totally worth it. This game, from what little I've played of it, is pretty linear. Uplink isn't, and lets you carry it on however you want, though it is not story-less. This game has a terrible UI in which you can't open up more than one window, Uplink has one of the best UIs I've seen to date, allowing you to have multiple windows open at once, and place things on screen as you wish.Now, if you say ""Well it's just an Early Access Game"" Well in the face of Uplink (made by 2 or 3 people) this game satnds no chance which is why I've gotta give it a thumbs down because for a small increase you can have a massive increase in quality. AND a finished game which works on modern systems."

319,2447,I DO NOT RECOMMEND!This game is more like a non-finished project more than early-access. I got stuck halfway through becuase a program wouldnt work on frogofempires.com to find a vulnrable sector.  I will come back when its fixed.

323,2445,"I would not recommend this game at this time. A lot of bugs (are balls in Pong supposed to go perfectly side to side? Maybe I missed something). The translations also need a lot of work. Feels cumbersome, and going back and forth between windows on the ""desktop"" gets tiring pretty quickly. Give it some time I would say."

327,2444,I cant seem to figure out the password at the start even thoe they give it to you and none of them work but over all has alot of potential they should include like the deep web and stuff that would be dope should add it in the next update like for reals

329,2444,"to make the game better, there should be an log file or so, if you forgot something from the InfoWindow, and the option to switch between the programs, an option to save the game would be nice....waiting for the next chapter"
330,2444,How to save game ?
331,2444,how do i restar a single mission
332,2444,"i love this kind of games, but is really early to launchi don like dont have a multitasking desktop, moveable windows, prev commands pressing upAUTOSAVE!!!i think that for this game are really importat correct or implement this featuresin order to has a really good play time,"
333,2444,has a potential to be a good game but right now theres a lot of bugs and keyboard issues
334,2444,"The game definately has potential!! it could be something great if they fixed the keyboard issues and had a longer storyline even for the first chapter it shouldnt take me 10 minutes. if it were 1.99 even 2.50 I'd say its worth the money, but as of right now save your money until a couple more chapters come out. BTW if you need help with the English instructions HMU. It's gunna be a great game when its done and I can't wait to see the finished product!!!!"
335,2444,"The game is pretty well built currently but does require additional tweaks. I do feel a better training mode can be added as the tips dont really assist you. The devs are going to include more chapters and will prolly make the game better over the couple of months. My advice is to wait for a couple of months till the game has more content in it for those who dont want to wait. Pros:Simple InterfaceCons:Lack of Commands (Needs more CMD commands)Need more usable items like Notepad,"
336,2444,"Pretty good. Would recommend. BUT  inability to save specific areas is gay as aids for someone like me who accidently clicks okay on a message and dosent know what to do, having to flat out close the game and restarting..."
337,2444,to do list :-moveable window-prev commands by pressing (up)-copy paste-multi tasking
338,2444,This is not an early access game. At best it could be called a prototype - and even as a prototype it is severely lacking. Despite being increadibly short it is full of bugs.
339,2444,As a computer and hacking interested guy i would say this game has alot of potential but in its current state it is borderline unplayable. I am literally unable to play past the first 6 minuttes because in game i cant make capital letters or the symbol : with a norwegian keyboard set to english This renders me unable to use the ingame cmdAlso it would be realy nice to be able to move in ingame windows araound so i can for example see the bankers password and the cmd in the beginning
340,2444,"This game is in an extremely raw state. Some of the ""applications"" still have headings in Russian; and the English prompts have extremely poor grammar. This will need a lot of time in the oven before it's ready. In the interim, I strongly recommend Hacknet."

355,2444,love the idea of the game but it needs a save button. also after you use the brute force I cant get any farther the last continue is a O and does not work
356,2444,"Not quite what I was expecting. Game seems to have been written in another language (I'm guessing Russian based on the screenshots that I have seen) so the english in the game seems to be somewhat badly translated. It is also missing any option for changing graphics settings. The hints that appear on screen cannot be retrieved once dismissed, so you will have to have a pen and piece of paper handy to write things down as you play. I believe that the game is still in Early Access though so hopefully most of this will be updated in the near future. I would wait until some of the bugs are worked out and more content is added before purchasing."
357,2444,"Great concept and I was having a lot of fun for the couple minutes I got to play it before it glitched on me.  First mission/task was fun but after hacking the bank account, you get a ""continue"" button that does't work.  Hoping they fix these little bugs so we can experience the full game.I cannot recommend it given the VERY short gameplay before fatal error."
358,2444,Alot of potential. Currently it's just a boring bugy. They will give you step by steps intrustion on what to do and you just simply type it in. The computer interface is very limited. I would suggest not buying the game for now at least until a better update for the game in the future.

360,2444,"Great concept and I was having a lot of fun for the couple minutes I got to play it before it glitched on me.  First mission/task was fun but after hacking the bank account, you get a ""continue"" button that does't work.  Hoping they fix these little bugs so we can experience the full game.I cannot recommend it given the VERY short gameplay before fatal error."
361,2444,"Awesome game but it's fuilled with bugs. Mostly You can't copy and paste, I was also unable to move the windows and use the numerical keyboard in the console."
362,2444,love the idea of the game but it needs a save button. also after you use the brute force I cant get any farther the last continue is a O and does not work
363,2444,"Not quite what I was expecting. Game seems to have been written in another language (I'm guessing Russian based on the screenshots that I have seen) so the english in the game seems to be somewhat badly translated. It is also missing any option for changing graphics settings. The hints that appear on screen cannot be retrieved once dismissed, so you will have to have a pen and piece of paper handy to write things down as you play. I believe that the game is still in Early Access though so hopefully most of this will be updated in the near future. I would wait until some of the bugs are worked out and more content is added before purchasing."
