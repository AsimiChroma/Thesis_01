0,2701,Really fun game with a nice atmosphere. I will definitely play through it again.
1,2698,"A sublime masterpiece, having much more substantial gameplay than Thirty Flights of Loving, and somehow more style, too. Going into it, I wasn't sure I would enjoy the aesthetic--early 20th century music and decor with retro computer tech plus sci-fi mega-cities, and cybernetic augmentations. But in the levels where all three 'eras' of design are combined, it creates a unique and truly pleasing setting. An station with hallways of art nouveau windows, letting in red light from the sun setting in the upper atmosphere, leading to 70s-like hospital wards of light-green tile, where you're meant to download a patient's electronic brain. (It's a shame that level didn't work on Linux; it's a good port overall but myself and others on Linux have run into a gamebreaking bug with the doors there.) Normally I would worry that too much gameplay would water down a series like this, that has so far been far more style than substance. But the levels are so dense with interactivity and props to inspect, that the two really drive each other.Extremely creative, it truly feels like there is a great vision creating the game. Despite being significantly longer than previous games, I am as always left wanting more, and anticipating whatever comes next."
2,2697,could not finish it because of a dismaying bug when the console doesn't clear but it seems like it's a rare bug. sucks for me but i it deserves a chance as it is a good game and you should play it!
3,2696,"Brendon Chung's unique narrative ability is very apparent in between the heist sequences. And the story here was actually quite a surprise. The game's many mechanics are fun to use, but with only 10 heists adding one gadget at a time, there's an almost uncomfortable amount of wasted potential in QC. Dont get me wrong; this is a nicely-crafted and gripping game that I wont soon forget, it's just that it could be so much more..."
4,2696,great game
5,2694,Can't believe I haven't already done a review for this. Everything this guy touches turns gold and this is no exception. My only complaint? The game ended.
6,2692,"What I like about this game is that is has a retro futuristic feel to it while also allowing me to feel some degree of nostalgia for the old days of computer use.  The ""hacking"" is pretty fun and I like the deck used in the game.  It has a fun feel to to it.  The music is pretty good, although I do turn it off just so that I don't get too distracted.  Plus cute robots to use.  Its worth your time and money to play and replay."
7,2691,good game
8,2691,A nice short little puzzle game. Some of them took some work to figure out but it always made sense so felt satisfying.
9,2691,"Took me years to get around to playing this but man did I absolutely love it. The use of basic elementary coding does a great job of making you feel like a ""hacker"" thief and from what I can tell there are countless ways to achieve your goal. Like the final stage involves using a lot of complicated processes to bypass a bunch of laser grids in order to get into a locked room. I tried this for awhile and got frustrated and climbed outside of the building to rig up a robot gun to shoot my way through the room's window. This kind of out of the box thinking is what made it so enjoyable (aside from the whole style and vibe -- loved this.) Will absolutely play again and hope for more time in this world someday."
10,2689,c o d e
11,2689,"It was a fairly short game, but I loved it. The puzzles were interesting and the world was very creative. At the end I only wanted more."
12,2689,"interesting mechanics, but a bit short"
13,2688,    heist .    .
14,2687,"I had been looking forward to playing this game for a long time. Biding my time and waiting for a discount greater than 50% but eventually I caved in and picked it up at half of. It was sitting at 100% positive reviews at the time so I figured I couldn't go too far wrong. It's not terrible but it feels unfinished. Some parts are frustrating like moving vaults especially when multiple launchers are involved but that is a relatively minor gripe. My main complaint is that there isn't enough to justify in being good. When it finally feels like the next level might be challenging, it's over. It was so unsatisfying how little content there was. I think there are around 10 missions but half of those felt like they were tutorial missions and none of them felt particularly meaty.tldr: I was underwhelmed if that's a word"
15,2687,"It is a great concept for a game, and if it were without bugs I would easily give it a thumbs up.Sadly the developer seems not to care about addressing the issues in the game, so I can't recommend it."
16,2687,"WOAH, this game is insanely cool so far, i love the concept and the execution, muah chefs kiss"
17,2686,"Really impressed with this hacking simulator. The gameplay captures a cinematic experience, which justifies the 3D environment. There is a lot of wholesome gaming goodness here, and I have no complaints against it. It meshes a bizarro game world with a real-world technical simulation. Lots of gaming content that justifies a slow exploration and revisting levels. Just be aware that the game expects a lot of typ[ng, which will be a dealbreaker for many gamers.I completed these capers on an Ubuntu 21.04 desktop computer. I encountered one crash which made me had to restart a level, but otherwise no other technical issues. The game takes 250 MBs of diskspace, and I played with keyboard and mouse controls. I learned about this game through the Zachtronic Podcast, which was an excellent introduction to this designers works."
18,2686,"Very cool, very chill puzzle game with a subtle sense of humor and a great general vibe. Worth playing through--it doesn't take too long, but the tools you have are fun to play around with and generally satisfying to apply to the problem you're faced with. The later levels get more and more intricate in a cool way. I wish there was a little more time spent with all your tools, but it doesn't overstay its welcome, which is also nice."
19,2686,"Quadrilateral Cowboy is a game for people who thought that more typing was needed in Jazz Punk.It is a pseudo hacking hacking game, but unlike Zhenzhen I/O or Else Heart.Break() requires little to no knowledge of programming.Levels:The levels start off simple and the different items you get to mess around with are fun. However, there is only one real way to win and it less challenges you to complete the level in fun and interesting ways and more implores you to move on.Programming:The programming was easy and fun! The programming was easy, it is easy to just dive in with no programming knowledge what-so-ever. The way the programming works would of been more fun with an IDE, however, for what it is, it works.Later Levels:The later levels were not fun. I believe that the game got too ambitious trying to add features that the game stops being fun 3-4 hours in. It was cool to experience what the developer had in mind, especially if you play with the developer logs, though it falls off for me half way through.Bugs:The one thing that frustrated me to my core was bugs. Bugs with the console, bugs with the game in general. It would soft lock you and you would need to restart with no in level saves to go back to that would fix the game."
20,2686,"Fun and quick, I'll try some mods later :)"
21,2686,"If it weren't for a few minor glitches, Quadrilateral Cowboy would be the perfect game. I usually hate puzzle games, but the puzzles in this game are intuitive and fun to figure out without hand holding. Blendo Games may not make the most open-ended games, but they more than make up for it with their movie-like content delivery. The game doesn't often dwell on one thing but when it does, it builds off of it by introducing a new variable to add difficulty. The style is also there, with goofy square dudes that have 2d faces. The game constantly surprised me with the capabilities of the idtech 4 engine.Overall, I give this game a 9.7 out of 10"
22,2686,This game is very very cool
23,2685,"Quadrilateral Cowboy distills the satisfaction of successfully learning/troubleshooting a new technological concept in spite of having limited information. In this case, those vague remnants of vital information aren't scattered throughout internet forum posts. Instead, they are provided up front and choreographed in intervals, often in a respectably hands-off way. Whereas the later portions of other puzzlers may treat wrong steps as progress away from the answer, experimenting in Quadrilateral Cowboy feels like progressing towards a solution.It's a light coding puzzler that condenses the joy of successful algorithmic logic inside interesting 3D applications. There's a level of apparent complexity that comes from the raw technology/hacker aesthetic that helps to make any sort of tampering feel intelligent. The visuals are appealingly gameplay-first, which perfectly mirrors the makeshift/alpha-test styling of retro-futuristic VR heist planning.By the end, the game felt criminally short. Since there's a new tool to learn in each chapter, most of the concepts dont receive direct collaboration with one another. It's a shame that there wasn't much of a chance to more deeply blend various tools. Despite it making sense for the context of the puzzles, being on a timer for many heists was a bit of a drag. The solutions in those scenarios were often less complex than efficiently executing each of the subsequent tasks that had already been individually solved long ago.Even if it can be picky at times, Quadrilateral Cowboy is still generally ingenious and fascinating to someone with an adoration for retro/DIY electronics and a growing knowledge of software development. Its certainly worth your consideration if one of your natural habitats are IDEs and you're sick of disjointed resources being better educators than your professors are."
24,2685,Fun
25,2684,ye
26,2680,9/10 Fun!
27,2679,"Wish there were more levels. Effectively, each mission is a tutorial for a new piece of equipment, with the exception of the last two. These two are very good and many of the tutorial missions are good as well. The base mechanics are extremely fun and I only wish I could spend more time with them."
28,2678,"Great little experience, but it falls short of what it could have been.  Feels like it's over before it starts.  It gradually introduces you to its mechanics, but once it introduces all of them, you only get one level wherein you get to utilize them all.  The result is that most of the game feels like a tutorial, and it never really puts you to the test in any way.  Still, what is here is great, and wholly unique.  This is my first Blendo game and I'm very impressed and will definitely be checking out more from them."
29,2677,too many textures
30,2676,"One of the best indie games that I've ever played. Most indie games fail to reach even half the caliber of Quadrilateral Cowboy.- The atmosphere, music, and art style are stylized and original. - Unique mechanics in every single level, no gameplay element is overused or underused.- A true puzzle game that rewards the player with numerous ""aha!"" moments without being too difficult or too easy,Just play it and support the developer. He is one of the few devs that still strives for originality and genre-invention."
31,2675,"It's not exactly a programming game. Instead it's trying to capture the feeling of being in a heist when everyone synchronizes watches and they disable the security grid for a split second at the exact moment when you grab the McGuffin. Nothing is particularly challenging, but it really nails the atmosphere and it's very satisfying when your little plan comes together perfectly.If you like Blendo's other games you'll probably like this one too."
32,2675,"Generally fun and sweet game about hacking/programming and using cool bits of tech to do relatively simple heists.Hacking/Programming - Main part of the game. Simple enough for people with no coding experience to do, but enough for people with coding experience to find enjoyable, but not challenging. The tech is fun to use, though simplistic, they have their own functions in code and usage which add some variety.Story - Not sure there was one, with no dialogue and little explanation I'm sure I either missed the story or the idea was for an experience more than a traditional story format. Still enjoyable, even if it didn't feel like it had an end per say. The setting is quite cosy with themes of friendship and hard work in a strange futuristic world, this allows it to not be as serious or miserable as a lot of futuristic/dystopian pieces of media.Bugs - Did notice quite a few bugs that should have been fixed as they are quite blatant. If this was a longer, more fleshed out experience I think i would have had more issue with the bugs, but since it was short and sweet, I didn't spend enough time playing to get frustrated by it. Bare in mind a decent amount of my playtime recorded on here was idle in the pause menu so that isn't accurate.Overall it is sweet, short and simple. Which I can see may not be something coding/puzzle enthusiasts would want as it doesn't really get too complex or deep (personally I would have preferred more coding and tech depth since I have limited coding experience). But if you want a fun experience with a bit of coding and tech it is definitely worth buying on sale for a quick enjoyable experience.When I Stopped:I completed it and am glad I did.7/10+ Fun and satisfying gameplay+ Sweet albeit simple story/theme+ Lets you feel cool and like you are learning as the game progresses- Too simple for my tastes- A little bit buggy- Story is vague and leaves you foggy on the point of everything"
33,2673,A beautifully tight yet complex game about using command lines to manipulate devices to steal things from people and with a lovely art style reflective of times when processing speeds where measured in terms of kilobytes.  They could have this game overwhelming in terms of level design but I think they nailed it with tight levels with a more or less singular focus on a given function at least until the last 2-3 levels where everything really comes together.  There's some really clever ways to break levels but even that requires thinking so far outside of the box that you'll have to pick up your brain afterwards.  The ending was unexpectedly heavy but in a really sweet way and the fact Blendo was able to tell a story that is as much about friendships and the passing of time as it is about manually adjusting the angle of your aimbot-enabled sniper rifle in order to shoot the laser grid deactivation button via embedded command prompts ('blinks') so you can safely advance your remotely connected scout bot ('weever') is a genuine achievement.
34,2672,its a (cyberpunk) heist game where instead of guns and violence you use your L33T hacking skillz. very fun.
35,2669,Fantastic experience. I love blendo games because of the world that it creates. Everything feels deliberate and the world just sucks me in. The gameplay is unique and fits perfectly with the world. I look forward to everything blendo puts out and can't wait for the next thing.
36,2669,A great little indy game. Its like a silent film in video game form with cyberpunk aesthetics.Its short but the puzzles are very satisfying to solve as you program and type away on your deck.
37,2668,"Short, sweet, and unique game. It explores all the ideas as much as they need to be explored and then gets out of your way. I almost wish that it had a bit more of the programming bits, but the environmental puzzles are great too. Overall, if you want a unique puzzle solving game with some light programming elements you're in good hands with Quadrilateral Cowboy."
38,2667,Great puzzles.  Quirky and beautiful design.

54,2661,"I love the actual gameplay, but at an aesthetic level this game is viscerally unpleasant to play. The player sound effects (even the non-damage ones) are stomach-churning gasps. The harsh lighting makes it very difficult to understand the level geometry (they have those zoom eyes, but they can't do some kind of optical amplification/exposure compensation?) and the dynamic lighting elements feel like something tacked on because it's high-tech not because it makes the experience better (it actually makes it worse)."

56,2660,"it's a bit like portal except you use a computer to solve puzzles instead of a portal gun and it's made by one person. The game's atmosphere and art direction are really solid and the so is the gameplay. They're some things you have to overlook as some levels are quite frustrating and the game never really uses all of it's elements together in one level. However for an indie effort, this game is really quite excellent and I highly recommend it."

60,2660,"Break into everything. Steal everything. Get obliterated by blimps with comically large dynamite suppression tactics. Plan everything and watch it all crumble apart because you sneezed wrong with the Weever and broke some glass window.This game is everything I've wanted. Little bit of hacking, a lot of trying to figure out what everything does and failing miserably in the process all while the game's story is the most nonsensical, simplistic crap you could imagine.You really should play it."

74,2656,Perfect visual style and great puzzles to solve
75,2656,"Blendo's first masterpiece. Satisfying puzzles that won't break your brain. Sparse but evocative level design. Charmingly blocky graphics with detail where it counts. A gentle sense of humor. A strange and beautiful setting. Makes you feel like a hacking god for being able to use command prompt.Achievement hunters and hardcore puzzle-solvers may be disappointed; you can finish the game very quickly if you wish, and there's little replay incentive (although I enjoyed the developer commentary mode). It took me ten hours at a leisurely pace.My only real gripe is that once you finally have a full set of equipment, the game is over. Then again, this is a game that teaches you to thrive with limitations. It's pretty fun to steal a safe with nothing but a personal computer and a handful of Wile E. Coyote-style gadgets.I bought the game on sale but the full price isn't unfair. I've already bought a gift copy for my brother. You can really taste the love in this one."
76,2656,Quick and enjoyable puzzle game. You are a criminal in a cyber / futuristic world taking place in the 80's and you are tasked with pulling off heists for your next paycheck. These heists are puzzles were you must simply sneak in and out without being caught.

80,2656,"Nothing like pulling out your portable vinyl turntable, slapping on some bigass over ears, puttin on Debussy and sneak you way through a museum or some such with nothing but a simple switch device and a computer inside a briefcase. This odd gem of a game is designed to teach you some coding basics, mixed with some basic stealth mechanics and a first person perspective. Its art stile with typical of this dev but you don't know them, the best mainstream comparison is Jazzpunk, however that game's humorous tone is missing. The first mission really sets up its vibe, Debussy's Clair de Lune playing softly in the background, accented with the slight crackle of old vinyl, while you make you way through a train, opening windows and doors with your little switching device. everything has a retro aesthetic, and this game could run on a potato. 20 dollars is a very solid asking price, thanks to solid gameplay and style, and with workshop support, the amount of content is very large."
81,2653,"Hands down, this is one of the best games I've ever played. If you have also worked with Linux or any sort of command line interface, this game will bring a smile to your face, I guarantee it.It's a puzzle game in a cyberpunk setting in which you need hack your way through heist missions using some very interesting gadgets."
82,2652,"Quadrilateral Cowboy is fantastic. I added it to my wish list years ago because I loved Gravity Bone and Thirty Flights Of Loving, but it took a long time for me to get around to buying it. It's not quite as good as those two games, but it is much longer, which is nice. You play a criminal who plans out heists for your criminal buddies. Over the course of the game you unlock more and more zany gadgets to crack ever-more-elaborate security measures. The heists are absurd and hilarious, and the scenes between them are the highlight of the game. Unfortunately toward the end of the game the heists start becoming more timing-based, so you're likely to screw them up and then have to replay several times over (you can't save mid-heist), which ruins the pacing of the story. Still, it is a really cool story and the minor frustration toward the end is worth it for the overall experience."
83,2651,"Another great Blendo game. When you see Blendo, you see Quality"
84,2651,"I love this game! I really enjoy the way they told the story. It just kind of lays it out in front of you without beating you over the head with it or explaining it to you. The gameplay was great! easy enough to figure out, but complicated enough that it felt a bit open worldish.Encountered 0 glitches, the whole experience felt very smooth!I would recommend getting it on sale due to the fact I got 100% completion in about 6 hours, and I don't see much replay value in it once you figure out the puzzles. overall 9/10 - very recommend"
85,2649,Great
86,2649,"Quadrilateral Cowboy is an idea which sounds good on paper, but in reality, doesnt translate well to the video game format. It has lots of cool ideas but doesnt really know how to build upon them or assimilate them all into a unified whole. Instead, for the most part, they seem to be used in isolation from one another, which is a wasted opportunity and doesnt really make for a satisfying experience. Then theres the inherent problem that constantly typing commands is, you know not exactly fun no matter how its presented! Especially so when youre constantly referring back to your command list because you cant possibly remember them allUltimately, the real problem with the game is that the developers had a cool idea (i.e., heists and hacking) but no fun gameplay mechanic with which to accommodate it - the exact opposite of how good game design should be. It feels more like a learning tool quickly cobbled together by a programming teacher as a fun and interactive means for his students to learn. Ironically, though, the game doesnt actually explain its mechanics very well at all, making learning quite difficult. Theres nothing wrong with a puzzle game being difficult because of its puzzles, but when its due to incompetent tutorials which leave the player unsure of how to use the many tools at their disposal, it becomes less forgivable.Lastly, the game is also very buggy and glitchy; one of the worst games Ive played for years in this regard, in fact. So, quite a few negatives there. The game does have its moments, but these are few and far between and the lasting impression of Quadrilateral Cowboy is one of frustration and boredom."

92,2644,"Fun and creative, I really enjoyed this one."
93,2643,good game
94,2642,It used to be fun but now there's so many bugs and it looks like the dev has stopped updating it.
95,2640,good 
96,2636,"Blendo games have widely varying degrees of gameplay and story. Quadrilateral Cowboy strikes the perfect balance for me. My biggest complaint is that there isn't more. There could easily be more challenge added to the existing content with a hard mode, 3 job marathon, the mind races.Workshop support is great but sadly underutilized. Also, there are some minor bugs and glitches.Overall: well worth a try, a great way to spend an afternoon."
97,2636,"This a fantastic game that is screaming for more workshop levels. At the time of writing this, the game has been out for 4 years and has about 8 workshop items in total, 6 are levels. That really depresses me, because this game deserves more.I played Blendo's other game, ""Thirty Flights of Loving"" way back in the day, and thought that it was all style with no substance. Thankfully, this game has both."

107,2632,"I loved this game, it was just wonderful from start to finish. Outside of a few minor bugs the game was pretty much perfect for me. The story was lovely, the little interstitial scenes were super charming and fun. Super funny, interesting and engaging game. Love, love, love"
108,2631,>Game based on coding>Never liked codingGood gaem but I not like
109,2631,IT IS SUCH A GOOD GAME
110,2631,Hit a few bugs but don't let that discourage you.  Lots of clever puzzles and a really neat vibe.  Definitely worth your time.
111,2628,"""Quadrilateral Cowboy"" has a very solid core game mechanic, upon which numerous additional mechanics are placed. It's a puzzle game at its heart, but it's also a platformer, a coding exercise, and much more.But you can ignore nearly all of that. Every level is entirely skippable if you're not enjoying yourself, with no punishment for pushing the ""not for me"" button. The thing that makes QC special is the world, the characters, and the bizarre experience of having a deliberately low-fi aesthetic produce better environmental storytelling than any Bethesda game. The game levels are good: the interactive ""cutscenes"" that lie between them are masterful.Explore every nook and cranny of these spaces and you will find a broad story composed of dozens of smaller, more personal ones. Pay attention to details because nothing will be spelled out for you."
112,2628,This game made me feel like a hacker (which was expected) and has one of the most affecting endings I've ever played.
113,2627,"This game is just so cool. I mean it. It's HIP. It's got a sort of whacky vibe you'll find in games like The Norwood Suite and Jazzpunk, but this is a puzzle game. You use a computer (called a deck in the game) and via the deck and a series of other cool gadgets you pick up along the way you figure out how the correct series of commands to complete the mission. Meanwhile, without a word being spoken, a very light story of friendship unfolds. The puzzles are fun and the world Blendo Games has created is VERY cool. My only ""complaints"" would be:1) The game is about 5-6 hours long. I certainly would have done more! The final mission really had me scratching my head for a solution. That being said, I have not explored all the mods available for the game, which seem to include a number of additional fan-made missions.2) A handful of times I got frustrated when I'd get almost all the way to the end of a mission and then something unexpected would go wrong, which means you have to do the entire mission again. This usually isn't an issue, but some of the late game puzzles take a bit of set up to execute, and having to do it over and over can feel a little tedious."
114,2626,only a few good missions.
115,2625,An excellent short and sweet tale.
116,2624,review.write(good)
117,2624,i love this game. it is a great relaxing game for the end of night
118,2623,"Really unique core mechanic which makes for great puzzles to solve. Great visuals, great vibes, good times."
119,2623,Cool game with good puzzles
120,2621,"A sweet game, very nice non intrusive atmosphere and ""story"". Constant introduction of new mechanics to keep it interesting and it doesn't overstay its welcome."
121,2621,"Pros:- Fun environmental puzzles using bits of an innovative pseudo-coding mechanic.- Cute minimalist world-building and narrative.Cons:- Some aspects of gameplay can be clunky control-wise, making maneuvering certain components into place under a time limit difficult.  Most missions require looking at a screen within a screen which makes it hard to see important details.- Tons of bugs and jank.  Had to restart the game several times because it would get stuck in strange unplayable states.  Somehow despite the blocky minimalist aesthetic this game made my 1080 Ti drop frames worse than DOOM or any modern AAA game.- There's really only about 5-6 hours of gameplay here.  For $20 such a short and unpolished product seems like a very poor value."
122,2621,"From the developer that brought us the classic Zombie Atom Smasher comes a unique puzzle game. It is effectively a Heist game with a ""hacking"" aesthetic. The game design is quite simple, the character models are the most basic I've seen since DK Mode in Goldeneye 64 but it works amazingly well. Every level is highly detailed, almost every object can be interacted with. The puzzles you solve while trying to complete the levels are quite interesting and can sometimes be challenging for precision. If you enjoyed the overall style of Zombie Atom Smasher and if you have fond memories of DOS prompt and writing batch files then I would recommend this game to you.- The only downside I can fault is the length of the game with only 10 levels which makes it incredibly short."
123,2619,If you like programming and good stories you will love it congrats to the developers
124,2619,"This game is Blendo Games' magnum opus. I went in expecting - and hoping for - something similar to Thirty Flights of Loving. Not only did this game deliver that through its manner of story telling, but it also offered an aspect that TFoL didn't: some of the best puzzle gameplay I've ever experienced. The hacking deck was cool enough, but as the game progressed and new tools were introduced to me, my mind was blown and I was excited to try out the new tool in the next heist. This game has cemented itself into one of my favourite games of all time.If you are on the fence about buying this game, buy it. You won't regret it.This game gets a 10/10"
125,2619,nice
126,2619,"Clever, witty, original, nostalgic puzzle game with a genuine underlying story and some very well developed fun mechanics. Cyberpunk heists from the 80's. Only gripe is that is was too short! I want more"
127,2618,"This is such a beautiful puzzle game. The main game play mechanic of hacking is really nice and easy to learn, but is taken full advantage of in many of the later puzzles, as well as some charming little gadgets that are use simple commands to control, but can quickly become elaborate once you add on more to create a sequence of directions which are vital to many of the puzzles. Highly recommend picking this game up if you love cool indie games with niche mechanics"
128,2616,really aesthetic
129,2616,"Quadrilateral Cowboy is a really interesting and cool game. It's billed as a 'hacking' game, but I would call that a misnomer; it's more like an infiltration and heist puzzle game. (Of course, one might say that infiltration is ""hacking a location""? But while you do type a few console commands, that part of the game is very simple.)Gameplay is, basically, performing a series of heists. (Technically the conceit is that you're ""planning"" the heists, but whatever.) You have to explore the levels and figure out what switches to press, or what commands to send to dataports in order to get to your objective. As you go through the game, you get introduced to more and more tools, and things can ultimately get rather complex. The gameplay is fascinating, and the really good thing is that it doesn't require much in the way of reflexes or manual dexterity. (I did have to play through the last level about half a dozen times, but it didn't get too frustrating.)Another really great thing about Quadrilateral Cowboy is its aesthetic. It's billed as ""twentieth-century cyberpunk"", and it seems to take place in an alternate world where twentieth-century technology is put to information age uses. This is a world where you can run heists on a cable car speeding through the night, where a space elevator has a ""Please return breathing equipment here"" door, where your character uses a ""Vinylman"" portable record player with headphones. It's fascinating and charming.Speaking of charming, one really interesting feature of the game is the cutscenes between the levels. They're understated vignettes that give you glimpses into the characters' lives. I don't want to spoil much, but even though these scenes were short, I really enjoyed them.All in all, I enjoyed my time with Quadrilateral Cowboy."
130,2615,"5 hour indie game with a solid core mechanic and decent puzzles. Requires some trial and error but once you're there it works. Doesn't really have a story but does this arty thing at the end which it doesn't really deserve, It's alright. feels like if it went on for a few more levels and the down time was more interactive, it would have reached 7/10. As it stands, 5/10. maybe 5.5 but it's alright.  You have a glimpse at the future, where you look through old pictures at the friends who've been present in the game just over. But you never interact with them, at all. There's a bit middle way through where you play tennis and a bit at the end where you toast but that's it. I can sum up the entire plot and character development with ""do heist, get paid"""
131,2612,"Game was quite extraordinary, love the indie story and gameplay, only wish there was more!  Make a second, make more levels I don't care.  It could be like the next portal but better."
132,2612,"Honestly I can't think of why this game isn't more popular. It is intriguing, the mechanics are spot on and the theme is brilliant. Love it to bits so far."
133,2612,"Had this on my wishlist for a long time not really knowing much about it, I guess someone recommended it to me. I wasn't even expecting a 3D game, which is not usually my favorite kind of thing.Turns out this was great though. I enjoyed the drop into a fairly robust world with no presented backstory (other than what's implied by what we see). The gradual escalation in complexity was very smoothly done. The map design was nice, lots of fun little details, sometimes interactive, if you want to make the effort to see little details. It's like a cross between Thief and Superhot.It's a good length, but also disappointingly short - the disappointment is because it's fun and ends while it's still fun, not because it's really fair to expect it to be longer."
134,2612,I didn't know what to make of this game at first and then it clicked and it's fun as heck. Programming (??) simulator. You plan heists using the C:> prompt. 10/10
135,2611,"This game is very cool. The concept is awesome, the gameplay and puzzles are satisfying to solve.With that being said, the game is very unstable. It crashes constantly, and the technical issues section of the forum is by far the biggest, and most of the posts have been completely unanswered for years.I got to a point in my game where I cannot progress, because the game crashes.I wanted to finish this game, and if it ever gets fixed, I will.Until then, I can't recommend anyone to get the game."
136,2611,Seriously one of the best games ever created
137,2611,"If you have even the slightest interest in hacking games, play this one.It's more atmospheric then anything else."
138,2610,"When you'll finish that game you'll ask yourself: ""What have I just played? Why didn't I stop when I could have stopped? Is there any hope for me now? Am I cursed?"" Yes, you are cursed. With indie gaming it is! Now pour yourself some more pixelated garbage and never play a triple-A title EVER AGAIN!"
139,2610,"Great game. Very unique and interesting.  About halfway through they start throwing in mechanics that are too simple for what you are initially teased with, but it's still fun nonetheless.  The campaign is far too short and I couldn't help but expect for more complex and difficult challenges later in the game, but I was sorely disappointed."
140,2610,:)
141,2609,"While an admittedly short hacking/heist game, it was packed with enough style to compensate.Looking forward to a ""Quadrillateral Cowboy^2"""
142,2609,"It's a shame it took me so long to buy this game, it's exactly my kind of game! I haven't even finished it yet but I want to recommend it already. I guess it took me a while because it advertises itself as a hacking game, which in games means ""play stupid mini games in terminal windows"".  It's just not a very informative classification. What this is in fact is a unique game that I'll just call a heist planner game. While stealth games focus on, well, stealth and improvisation -- the execution part of a heist -- this one focus on the planning aspect of it. This counterpoint with stealth games is pretty weak though, it still plays like a stealth game without sneaking. You have full knowledge of the place, you can noclip and fly around, and complete the heist in the simulator. It's all about navigating the environment and using your computer to open doors, turn off lasers, control turrets etc. You can concatenate commands to perform complex actions. Some actions are timed, like for example, some door that triggers an alarm after 3 seconds opened. Although I am having a great time with this game, it is a game with a very limited audience and rough around the edges, so I am finding the price tag a bit high. As I said, I am enjoying it so to me it's worth it, but it's a risky acquisition. I hope there are user made levels because this game would benefit tremendously from that. I know there are mods, from quickly looking over the forums."
143,2608,"Clever and fun game with a highly original setting and art style. It made me laugh out loud several times, smile from cheek to cheek and feel a sense of accomplishment when succeeding at the increasingly challenging puzzles. Definitely recommended!"
144,2608,"As is criticized by the top review, the game doesn't worth its price"
145,2607,"This is a beautiful, fun and enjoyable little game about being a space cowboy. The game has some gameplay bugs, however they are not game breaking and do not disrupt the experience. This game reminds me of other games like Shenzen I/O, but this one takes a different approach to this type of game. While coding and CMD control is part of the gameplay, it is not the only focus of it. This game has a story, interesting map and world design and a general feel, that i haven't seen other tech games implement before. I would recommend this game to anyone interested in code, heists and a good story behind the game. The following part of the review is a bug report for the developers of the game, it contains spoilers and is not relevant to the review: On the last level of the game, I experienced what seems to be a glitch in the casing mode. When flying through the ducts, where you are supposed to place a weever drone and make it jump a small gap to connect to 2 different datajacks, my character tripped the alarm above me. After repeating this glitch it seems like the viewbox of the casing mode is located in the feet of the body, making it hard to navigate the duct below the lasers. To repeat the bug, get into casing mode on the Abby YoYo Elevator job (last mission), get into the ducts below the room where the floor is covered with lasers and fly around."
146,2607,"Okay so yes, i like the game. With that out of the way lets get to the problems. First of all the game is a bit short, sure its got a lot of levels but they all feel like they are just teaching you. There isn't much actual game. This is mainly because the game never combines the things you learn. I loved to use the weevil but you only get to use it 3 or so times, and after that it becomes useless. I like the levels as they are, but there should more that are more open. like one that gives you a choice between weevil crawlspace and suitcase gun button tricks. Second the game gets changed to often, at first it changes a little and i like what comes from those changes, but about halfway in the game removes the solo and does this, odd to person heist, but you control both. And that only happens for two levels before its back to one person.To make a long story short, its a good game but it has wasted potential. Also its a bit overpriced."
147,2605,"The game is good and unique. it's got a fairly decent story about a bunch of friends and who take jobs and do some pretty cool . it's a nice story and has plenty of unique game mechanics. however it's failing is the fact that it doesn't really expand or play with any of the ideas it presents. or brings up. a good example of this is when you have to time your actions with copies of your past self. you THINK it's gonna be really cool. until all of a sudden you get all the upgrades yourself. and that's that. now that mechanics out the window.really the entire game is a massive tutorial. the real stuff is on the community workshop. i haven't ventured there myself but seeing as how there's a ""Mods"" folder on the main menu, it seems this was the developers intention too.so yes, it's a very fun game. interesting puzzle solving game. and here's a pro tip: the longer you spend in front of the deck to string commands together, the easier your life will be."
148,2605,"I was skeptical after buying Thirty Flights and feeling burned by the deal, but this game is actually...a game! And it's a game with highly unique gameplay! I'm pleasantly surprised, and can easily recommend this game."
149,2605,"This is such a cool game, the puzzles really make you think."
150,2605,"Somewhat short, but a must play if you want to accurately experience the life of an hacker"
151,2604,"After finishing this game, I'm mad. I love it, but I can't recommend it for full price.Mechanically it's incredibly solid, and the aesthetics have a lot of potential, but it ends up feeling more like a long demo than a full game. There is no third act where every skill comes together, with most of the stages being tutorials, yet some mechanics just show up at the end with no explanation, as if the devs finished them and were like ""Oh well just throw them in, we dont have time to make more levels for them). It's also terribly glitched at times, particularly with the physics, and I was forced to restart the stage a couple of times.I would love to see a sequel with more levels and a much much better story. As it is, its worth getting it for 5 bucks, 10 at most, if you're into programming and planning, but I really hope we get to see more done with it in the future."
152,2604,"Review in English/Portuguese - Anlise em Ingls/PortugusNo doubt one of the best games I've ever played, and among them we have the Legacy of Kain and Metal Gear series.I also love, LOVE coding (although I know next to nothing about it) and playing Quadrilateral Cowboy really made me want to learn programming. I know it's not sunshine and rainbows like in the game, but I really love what we can do with computers, and writing lines of codes to do simple or complicated commands just fascinates me.I'll definitely play some workshop levels because I just can't get enough of this game. I'd love a sequel or another story in the same universe, perhaps with some new codes or gadgets. Just amazing.You see the game was made with passion, and honestly, that's one of the big reasons this game is SO GOOD!Sem dvida um dos melhores jogos que eu j joguei, e entre eles tem as sagas Legacy of Kain e Metal Gear.Alm disso, eu amo, AMO programar (mesmo que eu saiba praticamente nada sobre) e jogar Quadrilateral Cowboy realmente me fez querer aprender a programar. Eu sei que no so raios de sol e arco-ris como no jogo, mas eu realmente amo o que podemos fazer com computadores, e escrever linhas de cdigo pra realizar comandos simples ou mais complicados simplismente me  fascinante.Eu com certeza vou jogar alguns nveis da workshop porque eu no consigo enjoar desse jogo. Eu adoraria uma sequel ou uma histria ambientada no mesmo universo, talvez com cdigos novos e alguns gadgets tambm. Simplismente incrvel.D pra ver que o jogo foi feito com paixo, e sinceramente, essa  uma das razes desse jogo ser TO BOM!"
153,2604,"Who doesnt want to play out the role of a hacker in a cyber punk voxel utopia? This game makes you feel like a hacker, the gadgets add a unique layer of level design and navigating the command line is a complete joy. Pushing through each mission rewards small slices of world exploration which is a complete joy in this bizarre voxel universe. My #1 hacker game (I absolutely adore eclectic voxel games)!"
154,2603,high qULITY GAME NO OTHER EXPERIENCE LIKE THIS
155,2603,"Finally got a chance to play (and finish) Quadrilateral Cowboy.  Overall, I really liked this game.  I didn't know coming into it too much other than there was a retro-futuristic style hacking element and puzzle solving.  But I quickly found myself pretty addicted to finishing the next challenge.  First off, the Pros:1. I really liked the atmosphere of the game.  There were lots of throwbacks to older technologies (as a die-hard Amiga fan, I absolutely loved that there was a Guru meditation error on one of the screens).  The phonograph style music combined with Cyberpunk living ala Bladerunner made for a really cool combination.  The fact that the game is based around low-polygon graphics in no way hampers the visual feeling I got when playing.2. The puzzles were (for the most part), fun and well designed.  There were a few times when I was a bit frustrated over the level of precision necessary for a puzzle, but that was rare.  I liked the hacking aspects, and when multiple steps/blink control was introduced, it added a slight programmatic element that made it even better (I wish this was explored more, but that's okay).3.  The cut scenes between levels were a fun, often funny diversion as well.  Loved the cat-run black market (speaking of which, providing a new upgrade each level made progressing fun as well).  Cons:1. The base game is definitely on the short and easy side.  There are 10 levels, but most of the early ones don't take particularly long to solve.2.  The game does feel a bit rough around the edges, especially with physics/collision detection stuff.  There were a few bugs I ran into it (sometimes when accessing the terminal, I'd start breathing heavily like a window into space just broke, even though it didn't.  Sometimes I'd be pushed to the left in canvas mode with no way to move.  Some other weird movement related things).  Not really a show stopper by any means, but when you're working on the same puzzle for a while, it can get irritating for something to screw up.Other than that, I overall liked the game, and definitely suggest it to anyone who likes physics puzzle solving ala Portal (or anyone who is into retrocomputing/hacking styled games).  Glad I finally got a chance to play it!"
156,2603,"Fun 3D logic puzzle game, but just too short. Sure you could make your own levels by modding it, but playing those would be fun only to the others who don't know the puzzles you made. Too bad almost noone has done more levels for it."
157,2603,"Absolutely fantastic game. The aesthetic, the game play, the underlining story, it all speaks for itself. If you enjoy just casual coding or are interested in that type of thing check it out. Overall coding wise don't expect a major challenge but my god is it fun and makes you feel smart and sneaky.i would rate it a hacking yee haw out of a cyberpunk tarnation."
158,2602,it is very fun and hard
159,2602,"I love it so much, god I wish that were me.  I wish it were much longer is all."
160,2602,Epic.
161,2601,"negatives: music is eh, wonder if that can be changed in a mod or something.positives:everything. holy cow.tutorial is super simple, and easy to follow.some missions have a brick wall that makes you think; ""what the f***"" but then once you figure it out you'll be like ""f*** yeah!!""the game is kinda short, if your good. maybe like 3 hours. if your good.however, if you're anywhere near my level, it'll take you 6.the environment is really rad, its got a criminal cyberpunk underworld type of vibe, but you're the criminal, and the weever is the criminal, and the lasers are the criminal, and the. you get the point.it has some weird comedy, didn't put me off, but you'll understand what i mean when you play it.oh, and the art style is kinda chunky, but It compliments the game some how, oh and the GRAPHICS! i mean i know the art is chunky, but for some reason, the detail on the computers feels really nice, and some other details, you'll get what i mean once you play it.one last thing before i go, why. why in GODS NAME did you not add a TRAIN MISSION! AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH, it would've been so COOL! i mean there is one, but the train ""Car"" is way too small! i mean a TRAIN! like the one they showed you in the first tutorial! it would've been sick! you did this to me BLENDO, teasing me with TRAINS! Curse you BLENDO! CUUURRSEEE YOUUU!!!blink 1 exit aimbot; deploy; fire; wait (1); fire*furiously blinking*"
162,2601,"amazing game, teaches you to code (slightly) with realistic program calling and great puzzle aspect. one thing that is sad is its short, can be completed within 4 hours if you get a hold of how the game works but the puzzle element is amazing, figuring out how your going to do it and how to write the program is amazing, would recommend to any bored programmer"
163,2600,"Swanky but Janky Quadrilateral Cowboy is a cyberpunk heist game developed by Blendo Games. Its described as a hacking game, but thats not really accurate as you just type in basic lines of code. Anyway, you play as a nameless (I think?) character who as part of a three-person crew performs heists. Over the course of ten jobs youll steal a wide variety of things ranging from documents to safes. Positives: The aesthetic here is awesome. I love how chunky everything is, I love the depressing dystopic world and it all works so well together.There are some cool gadgets that you unlock over the course of the game that are fun to play with, including a little robot weevil and a briefcase that deploys into a turret.The level design is pretty cool, theyre all well varied and fun to explore. Later in the game youre able to use the other two members of your crew, which was pretty fun. They both have unique skills/abilities and the way the game handles using two characters was neat. The music is awesome. Neutral: The levels are all linear and theres really only one way to complete them. It made it feel more like a puzzle game than a heist game. I dont necessarily think its bad as a result, but I was a bit disappointed that there wasnt much room to experiment or do your own thing. Negatives:This game is super janky. Some jank can be kind of charming, but here the jankiness can get in the way of playing the game at times. For example, you can climb up ledges, but because of the way that works it can be difficult to do in closed spaces and the way its animated is really awkward. The jank really gets in the way when you have to do things involving specific timings, Ive found the last level so frustrating for this reason, Ive given up on finishing it. The majority of the levels feel like theyre just tutorials for the gadget you just unlocked. Each heist has three parts, so I could understand the first part feeling like a tutorial, but with all three feeling like a tutorial you just end up with a game that doesnt feel very challenging. The last level is the only one that really feels like youre on your own, but by then its obviously a little too late. As far as I could tell, there wasn't really a narrative here.Verdict: Its puzzle-y heists are enjoyable, but the game feels like one long tutorial and is too janky for its own good. I would say its worth picking up on sale, but only if youre really into weird indie stuff. If you found this review helpful, please consider following my curator page: Kemo's Corner."
164,2600,"Pleasant Puzzler with a slight programming twist.  Do not let the reliance on the tech scare you away, it really is more about cramming your ideas into a given format.  If you're in to the idea of planning a heist and love games that require some planning, this is for you.The story is both light and heavy, at the same time.  A glimpse into a section of life for a group of friends, how they achieved something great, and the joy that nostalgia can bring.I question the $20 price point given the content length, but when on sale for $10'ish, I highly recommend."
165,2600,"love it, makes me feel like  hacker"
166,2600,"Fantastic game. The hacking is fantastic, though unfortunately there isn't much of it. The style is awesome, evocative of cyberpunk and Minecraft.My only real complaint is that there isn't more of it!"
167,2600,"One of the most satisfying gaming experiences I've ever had. Blendo understands how to apply cinema editing techniques to games without interfering with interactivity, their use of short scenes and cuts punches the story home and provides emotional beats. It also creates a realized world without requiring a 100-person dev team. Though the world is small physically it is full of details for those who like to look around and pick everything up too.This is a cyberpunk hacking game that understands that if physical violence is required then things have gone to hell. This game is about terminals and scripts, it is about planning and executing that plan. It is a stealth game that is not about waiting for guards to walk around. It's about being ride-or-die for the people you love.Recommend if you enjoy: Zachtronics games (SpaceChem, Magnum Opus), Portal 1/2, Hitman, PUBG, Metal Gear Solid series, Wolfenstein reboots, movies in general"
168,2598,"Really boring and bad, it had a good  chance of being something more.Graphics are bad, theres no story, hacking is superfluous and tools feel irritating and pointless. dont buy this game. its horrible. Great concept, horrible realization"
169,2598,Literally one of my favorite games ever
170,2594,This game is a perfect kiss on the cheek.
171,2593,"I just love hacking in games and Quadrilateral Cowboy is one of the best examples of it. With a nice visual style to boot you'll be breaking into and out of a myriad of places while completing contracts for... well, who knows who. It starts out simple with just quick jacking in and activating pre-placed commands but before long you'll be timing gun shots to your movement and activating your robot buddy with a blink of your eye. Literally.The game takes a light touch to presenting a story but there definitely is one there if you're willing to look. I like the way the developer makes the story opt in which feels like it rewards you for keeping your mind and eye open to any info. And I found the developer commentary to be a nice addition though I just wish there was more of it in the game!All in all, highly recommended!"
172,2588,"Quadrilateral Cowboy is a great game. You have so many tools at your disposal, and the game itself is really quite immersive from the cyberdesk you can literally deploy anywhere, to the satisfying clacking of the keys as you plan out how you'll complete your objectives, because in most cases, you won't have a lot of time to act. You have a three second window to work with when it comes to disabling lasers or opening windows. I love the amount of tools you can work with, my personal favorite being the portable ""weevil"" drone you control via commands in the terminal, while your only method of FPV are two CRT monitors you'll deploy right next to your computer. It's these moments that are enjoyable. Plopping down your equipment wherever you please and tackling your objective from afar. I think I've seen a few comments comparing this game to Watch Dogs, and you know what? This is what I wish Watch Dogs was. But..Well..It's kind of just casual fodder, anyway.It's such a satisfying feeling to breach a level, figure out the precise pattern to navigate through laser1 and laser 2, while having the door open with a delayed command. However, I share everyone else's sentiment that the game is too short, and there are tools you acquire that just don't feel like they're used enough. I'm conflicted about this, though. Because I don't want to pin this on Blendo Games and take points away from them, but on the other hand, it's a $20 game and it just needs a bit more meat on its bones. Maybe just a suggestion then, if ever they make a second game. Because this doesn't affect how I feel about Quadrilateral Cowboy. I think it's more of a testament of how much fun I had, and how great this game really is. The level editor could've added a lot more replayability...Too bad no one uses it, though. I mean, there's like 8 items in total on the Steam workshop? Come on. A level editor is perfect for this kind of game. That is just unfair."

175,2585,"Haha, This is awesome! A true passion project, with a superb, well-executed vision and just the right number of shout-outs. And, despite being the indie-est indie game I've ever played, it's polished and glitch-free. No doubts, I enjoyed it a lot."
176,2585,"Pretty cool game. Puzzles don't seem to get too complex, however I still enjoyed it."
177,2585,Fantastic indie hacker sim. 9/10 too short
178,2583,Quite a lovely little game. It's a shame it's so short but I really enjoyed the experience.
179,2583,"With a computer terminal and a bunch of tools Quadrilateral Cowboy has you hack your way through puzzles in a blocky retro world.  I enjoyed the game but did get it on sale and after playing it through, would also recommend getting it on sale.  If you expected programming in this there is little to none, more using the shell and the most complex scripting being piping to chain commands together.  I wish the game was longer, and some of the later missions to themselves be longer instead of each one adding some new mechanic and only having one objective.  Technically the game runs well, but I did have problems with a 4K resolution messing up extended duel monitors that resulted in me not being able to see the game window, 1080 and below did not give me any issues."
180,2583,"I picked up an ashtray - just a random ashtray that was lying around - and then dropped it on the floor accidentally. I thought to myself - with the level of detail in this game, I wouldn't be surprised if the devs had modelled the ash falling out...I picked the ashtray up again. They had.I think that says something about the charm and love and effort put into Quadrilateral Cowboy. It's one of those short-but-sweet games - a concentrated burst of fun that leaves more of an impression in 10 minutes than most games do in 10 hours. There is a stunning level of detail put into every scene, from the aforementioned interactivity to the well-written signs and product boxes.The gameplay is a ton of fun too, combining Hitman-esque planning with some good old-fashioned command-line hacking. When you crack the solution and watch all the parts come together, it's a great feeling.As others have noted, it's short, but every minute of its 4-5 hours made me smile. There are so many ideas packed into this game, it's a shame they aren't expanded on more. In particular the two levels where you have to plan out the actions of two characters to run simultaneously (open the door for your buddy - wait 30 seconds for them to go in and unlock a door - go through that door etc.) is such a fantastic idea that could easily fill out a whole game.I really enjoyed Gravity Bone and Thirty Flights of Loving - again, very short games that I can remember more vividly than games I played for 30+ hours. I skipped this when it came out because I heard it got some average reviews, but that was a mistake. If Blendo's style is your bag, you'll like it!"

198,2581,"A really interesting game that takes simple coding and mechanizes it into a whole game. It has the usual Bendo charm to it but fleshes it out more into a 3 to 5 hour experience rather than just their usual 30 or so minutes. I think the art style works for what it is, I played Gravity Bone and Thirty Flights of Loving before this and thought the style was already pretty good for it's 70s esque aesthetic, but it does feel weird to see certain elements that weren't in those two, such as the more cyberpunk elements, but I quickly got used to them. My favorite parts were the puzzles and how logical yet incredibly simple they could be once you figure it all out and understand the coding language for each of your tools, and looking at a guide after finishing the game seemed to give off the sense that there are multiple solutions to each puzzle, so that was pretty neat to figure out. However, this game isn't without its faults, I think the puzzles and in fact the entire game itself ends way too soon, where just as soon as you get to a point where things pick up, the game ends, and its a shame as I felt there was a little more you can do, though I still haven't tried out any mod levels so that might satiate my fix for that. One gameplay moment I really didn't enjoy was the level where you played as Lou and Maisy as it felt really pointless, as you do one quick puzzle with them and immediately gain both of their abilities after you finish it, and it makes me question why even keep it in the first place. The story itself is a bit lacking too as while it feels like you go through an entire arc and can understand what is happening by the time you finish, I personally felt there wasn't much beyond what you could figure out on your own, somewhat a facsimile of the game itself in a sense, however my complaints with the story can be considered a small complaint, as it really doesn't take much hold over the puzzles even once stakes are increased. Overall, a really good game for those who love puzzles and games with a unique style and personality."

But it does stand up as a decent puzzle game that will make you think for more than a second.The story is ambiguous to the point you can use a fair bit of your imagination to interpret what is going on. However, that ambiguity doesnt detract from the heist based puzzles that are a treat to figure out, during each and every level.My big gripe (like most people), is that the game is very short and ends fairly abruptly. Unfortunately, it would have been nice if everything you learnt was culminated in the use of one big level at the end. Never the less, had loads of fun and still well worth it on sale, $28.95AUD is a bit much though."

208,2573,"Quadrilateral Cowboy is one of those rare games where you can feel the heart the creator put into it. The game is flawed and lacks polish- I died or got stuck occasionally when I got thrown through a wall, the game crashed to desktop multiple times around the midway point (not too much of an issue as the game autosaves after every level but still annoying), and the last level is an incredibly steep difficulty spike compared to the rest of the game. Despite all this, the core mechanics are well thought out and implemented, getting you to really feel like you're a super spy. The game's ambiance is also fantastic, painting a picture of a distopian, retrofuturistic 1980 that draws heavily on steampunk aesthetics and early 20th century science fiction. Quadrilateral Cowboy is a very human experience that happens to have a reasonably good puzzle game attached to in- while I probably wouldn't buy it for the full price 20$, this would be at the top of my list of games to get while on sale"

Likely these are on-going issues, but it's still great to see support after it's been out so long."
222,2556,"Very different and refreshing. Original mechanics, genuinely charming story and style, and a fun experience. Would recommend to anyone."
223,2556,"It's hard to decide whether to recommend this game.  Ultimately I have to say no, though I fully believe many will love it, but in the end I put it down.First thing I should caveat this with is I'm REALLY not a fan of the Blendo games' style.  I think the blocky, low-poly visuals and washed-out, muted colors look really awful, and I just don't buy the idea that a game can look ""good"" by deliberately trying to look dated visually.  I'm not a  for presentation, but a nice presentation goes a long way to make up for shortcomings elsewhere in a game.  Here, the terrible graphics and limited use of sound are only a detriment.The actual gameplay is where this game shines, and is at odds with the game's design at almost every turn.  The idea is you pull off heists by interacting with the world via a simple computer interface, where you code command lines to switch off lasers, open doors, aim guns, etc.  This felt wholly original and unique to me and for a while I was having a LOT of fun with it. Even the clunkiness honestly adds to the experience (for example, lots of trial error in determining how far to zoom in, where to aim a gun, things like this).  But it adds to the experience because it feels like you're actually programming and solving problems via this computer interface.  It's cool.I just wish this concept was put into a better GAME.  The design decisions in Quadrilateral Cowboy are baffling.  Aside from the whole game feeling like a tech demo, here are some of the annoyances I had in the couple hours I've played:1. Lots of levels have intant-fail conditions that take you back to the beginning if you're not extremely careful at every step.  In some sense these can add to it too (like needing to open a window before shooting a bullet through it or an alarm will go off, or planning out how to escape a room in 10 seconds knowing an alarm is going to go off soon).  But the fact that the levels have no checkpoints meants you'll be going back to the beginning sometimes only to slug your way through the same 90% you've already done just to get the timing of that last 10% down right.  It's annoying.2. The game doesn't build.  It introduces new mechanics and then quickly forgets about them more often than not.3. The jumping mechanic is ridiculous.  There was one level where I was stuck for a while because I couldn't figure out how to progress, only to realize I needed to jump onto a platform that's like 20 feet high (apparently the main character can jump REALLY high for no clear reason).  But the need to jump in that level made absolutely no sense in terms of design - it wasn't a platforming segment, there was no challenge involved, there was just one very specific moment where you had to jump once and that's it.  Very strange.4. There's a story, but it's doled out in short, weird, obtuse bits that make very little sense on their own, and I quickly lost interest trying to piece it together.  I also absolutely hated Thirty Flights of Loving and thought it was a complete waste of money, so take that for what it's worth, because the storytelling here is similar.Overall, I just wish a developer would take this concept and polish it into a game that's more worth playing, with a better presentation, more cohesive design and mechanics that actually build on one another and introduce themselves at a pace that makes sense.  What's here now is worth trying if you can get it on sale, but otherwise it's hard to recommend."
224,2556,"Brendon Chung is one of my favorite indie devs, and he didn't disappoint with Quadrilateral Cowboy. It's such a unique idea executed beautifully, even if it all comes to a close just a bit too soon. Worth a look if you're into cyberpunk or retro-futuristic aesthetics.4/5 stars"

If you someone that couldn't decide whatever buy or pass this game: You must buy it!But there are some cons too.

232,2551,Good 
233,2551,"A great little cyberpunk puzzle game that requires something close to actual programming for it's puzzles. Gotta make use of a deck with various gadgets at your disposal, including a remote control robot and gun, among some others. interestingly enough it manages to get by on a cute little story about three girls and their independent hacker company, Impala Solutions. There's the same charming blocky style as seen in Gravity Bone and Thirty Flights of Loving and the game is more straightforward about its plot. Beware this is a short game and 20 bucks might be a tad pricy for some. In fact, there's only about 9 or so actual missions (with about 3 objectives, or mini missions, per level) intercut with little segments in between and they don't really fully utilize everything they teach you in the levels up to that point. Aside from that, there's a couple of mods in the workshop (unfortunately there's not many) that are considerably more thorough.Quadrilateral Cowboy is a neat, arty little cyberpunk game for those who like the art style and midly interested in what programming entails, and know little to nothing about it. Moderately recommended."
234,2551,"Short and sweet as per usual with Blendo Games. One of the best 'coding' games out there, but this is more like a heist puzzle simulation than just coding. Although the coding aspect doesn't have much depth beyond queueing commands, it's still an enjoyable mechanic, and works well with the missions in the game.If you're into quirky indy art games this is definitely for you.PRORuns on Doom 3 engine, looks and runs well on just about anything. Is only a 250mb install.Some of his best level design work (I've played through all Citizen Abel mods, and previous Barista games)Great soundtrack and sound design.Has mod support.CONConfusing mission objectives / progression.Although full of detail and interactivity, story is linear."
235,2551,Weird but amazing story
236,2551,"Great game, Short and Relaxing, Love the atmosphere."
237,2551,Short... but amazing.
238,2551,"Fun, interesting and thoughtful game"
239,2551,"Some intersting ideas but feels more like a proof of concept than an actual game to be honest. You are given tools in a most psychedelic way, then presented with a scenario in which that tool is used, then you move on to the next ""level"". Unfortunately, at the ""Repulse Bay Impound Lot"" level the gameplay changes completely, from simple problem solving to a timed trial-and-error thing where you have to change back and forth between characters in a way that made zero sense to me. Overall, the game is thick with WTF is going ons and very little else.Maybe if these tools were given in a more sandboxey game world where the player could explore, learn and discover his way through gradually opening up a world at their own pace this game would appeal to me more. Would not recommend unless it's on sale and you have an interest in unconventional game design."
240,2551,The most fun you can have with a machine.
241,2551,"A wonderful puzzle game that has you planning heists in VR(in-game, not actual VR). You are given tools to handle your problems and charming environment style in vain of previous games by ""Blendo Games"" like Gravity Bone.The central feature of the game is a computer that allows you to script commands that help you solve problems in levels. You don't have to know how to code to complete the game, but if you want to improve your results to a shorter time, you could improve your skills during your first playthrough and apply your knowledge during replaying levels and seeing how far you've come.The game takes less than 10 hours, but it's much more than it took to beat previous games of Blendo Games, which is much appreciated!"
242,2550,You get a cute drone which you can nagivate through vents using qbasic. 10/10
243,2550,"I've only played about two hours so far and about an hour of that time was JUST looking around at things. This game, while having a simplistic aesthetic has incredible minute details that kept me looking at EVERYTHING around me constantly. I immediately fell in love when I could zoom in to see your companions' names on the labels of winter presents! As for the gameplay, the first 3 non-tutorial levels have been quite enjoyable for someone who's taken a coding class before. I wouldn't say it's quite as intensive as coding though. To anyone who's played ""Gunpoint"" the interactions with your computer is sort of a mix between its hacking and real coding. The computer is sort of linked to everything it can interact with in the environment already, you just have to schedule those things to work for you at the right times."
244,2550,This game is great for enviromental story telling. There is no dialogue but there is plenty of character. The low graphic have a certain charm that works for this game. I hope cyberpunk 2077 has half as much clever gameplay as this. My only grip is when at a certain point gameplay changes and it isn't immediatle shown what to do.
245,2550,"This game is great. Nice music, fantastic atmosphere, great visuals, fun and very creative. The sad point in this game is that the game is very short.Every person who like the computing and hack topics should try this game."
246,2550,Having fun with this.
247,2549,"so good, just so so good, Blendo games has done it again. Buy this game, have a day or two set out to complete it. Grab your keyboard, your thinking cap, and some freetime and enjoy!"
248,2549,"ARRGH! Just when i think the games over, there's more! I love it, making little shorcut programs so i can instantly exacute automated commands. It really slips you in gently too the programming, before i knew it i was making batch files within batchfiles. ""getpos"" is such a good Aimbot.exe command.I love the later levels when you start cooperating with yourself. so good. I recommend new players TRY EVERYTHING! sometimes hacking works, sometimes you need to set up an elaborate network of events. I need more of this world."
249,2549,"It's cyberpunk-hacking-heist game set in the far future of 1980s. You sneak around vents, find terminals to hack doors with your top-of-the-line, 256k RAM, 64k ROM, 10 Mhz clock microprocessor, hacking deck (I know, it's quite overpowered just to hack some doors or camera), steal the top secret diskette, then get the hell away from Dodge. It's cute, the world is full of details that you'd miss if you just mindless run and do all the missions, and is super good.Gameplay is smooth as jazz, make you feel like you're an actual hacker, doing an actual heist, but what also amazed me is all the style dripping from the lo-fi graphic. The graphic is not fancy, but it's just chock full of subtle details and humours and style and doesn't feel like blocks bought from asset stores because the creator can't do any better (the point is, it might! but the dev definitely know how to make it like it doesn't! This really show the difference between good and bad designer)."
250,2549,"This isn't an easy one to review because some aspects of the game like the console commands and the puzzles are done really well. The puzzles are lacking the fine polish of a big studio, but they are never overly fiddly or difficult as a result. The levels are each well crafted and tell a narrative. I like the changes in environment and all the tools used in the game are each interesting in their own way. For anyone interested in console commands computer hacking and heists, this is a great game. But thought my playthrough something was bothering me. I kept asking ""Why is my character doing these things?"" and that is never answered which leaves a narrative hole that I wish was filled. This hole is the motivations of the player-character. The best narrative objectives in video games will provide an urgency and purpose to the gameplay, but Quadrilateral Cowboy is devoid of any purposes behind any of the player's actions other than the objective of the current level. And this negatively effected my playthough. I know I am complaining about an element of theming, and some people will love this. But it wasn't for me. However I am still glad I played through to the end because I enjoyed each level.2/5"
251,2549,"Amazingly smart, well crafted and fun to play!"
252,2549,"I hated to thumb down this game because it is really good 'IF' you like that sort of thing. Let me explain:It is listed as a puzzle game but it is more of an Arcade Game. You know the kind, you have to do things 'Over and Over' until you jump at the exact second, or hide from something, a timer running, etc. etc. I hate these kind of games (They are the type that were originally designed to keep you pumping quarters into a Video Arcade Machine.I like just plain Puzzle Games like the ones at miller world inc that just present you with a puzzle and you then just have to figure out the answer. A true puzzle game shouldn't require you to learn new keystrokes, time jumps, run fast, hide, guess what you are supposed to do next. Those types of games just try and get you to figure out what the programmer wanted you to do, in what order, how fast or slow, etc. They are not true puzzles but more like idiot training like you would do your dog. With a true puzzle, once you realize the answer you would just do it (Not have to figure out HOW the programmer wanted you to do it...with the jump to exact location, run faster, etc. etc. like I explained above.Of course, if you like that sort of frantic pressure, you may Love Quadrilateral Cowboy.The thing that threw me was that the game starts off as a true puzzle game and then slowly meta-morphs into the arcade type."
253,2549,This is an extremely fun game. If you like: Hackers (1995) you'll especially dig this but it's a nice puzzler in any case.There are... a lot of bugs though.
254,2548,"Great game but... it's too short!It has a nice progression to slowly reveal the hacking tools available, and then it abruptly ends. Hopefully the devs have more levels planned..."
255,2548,wow so much fun felt way to short I wanted the game to go on forever fun story fun levels wish there was like 2 more levels that used all the tricks you learned needing to use blink and multi people and such. the last level was over so fast I thought it was the start of something big but it was the end needs a part 2 very badly.
256,2547,"This is one of the greatest games I've ever played, and I just wish there was more."
257,2546,"This game is freaking amazing, a bit short unforchantely. It only took me about 10 hours to complete the game but every second was enjoyable. The puzzles seem daunting at first but the satifisfaction of solving them is worth it. They certainly were fun, getting my brain to work hard piecing everything together. It was a relaxing experiecnce for me to play this game listening to its soothing soundtrack as I solved its puzzles. The ending made me a bit sad wanting more puzzles and for the game not to end. If you like puzzle games and hacking then this game is exactly for you. I would highly recommend it to anyone that seems interested."
258,2545,Wish there was more to it level-wise but like the direction and way it was taken. The story and mechanics are it's strong point.
259,2540,Beautiful little game.
260,2539,"I love this game. The puzzles are fun but never too hard. I felt like a genius all the way through. I cried at the end (although I cry at the end of a lot of games, but still). Please buy this game!"
261,2537,Pretty fun but I don't really want to write very much so I would say that there are certainly a set of people that would enjoy this game
262,2537,"Hacking can be fun, as it turns out. Short but sweet, with lots of imagination."
263,2534,This is an amazing game that I almost missed. It is a bit short but each puzzle presented is interesting and different from the last. You'll end up feeling really clever for figuring out a particularly difficult level. Definitely worth a look
264,2533,"Heist-style first-person puzzles. Don't let the presentation intimidate you, there's no programming, just very simple (and clearly explained) ""command-line"" instructions. (Maybe some minor ""scripting"" in terms of queuing up several instructions in a row, in places.) Not a cakewalk though; it gets devious, just more in spatial-puzzling ways than in anything computer-related. Very fun, very charming, great framing story. Only downside is it's *very* buggy,  in ways that can make replaying levels to set time trial records more frustrating than it should be. Still worth it though."
265,2531,"Why don't we call our laptops ""decks"" in real life?"
266,2530,"Pretty damn great. The amount of style and thought that's gone into this game's design is wonderful, only a few hours in but loving it."
267,2529,"A massively underrated game, so much creativity, both in the aesthetics & the puzzles. I really hope this gets a sequel & the attention it deserves."
268,2529,"Overall, I recommend this game, but I can't help but long for more. The aesthetics and presentation are top notch here. If you're a fan of hacking, capers and puzzles, you will find lots to love here."
269,2528,Very fun puzzle game! Lived up to my expectations.
270,2528,"This was a pretty fun puzzle game. The hacking mechanic was pretty well done, and the game has enough tools to keep the puzzles interesting. I wish there was a larger community for this; I'd love to see what kind of puzzles people would come up with.There's one level that crashed for me sometimes, but the game ran pretty well besides that."
271,2527,"Fantastic game!I love the simplicity of the graphics, the humorous and cheezy but at the same time gritty and dangerous universe, and if you pay attention, for a game not exclusively about story, it's got a pretty good one. The core mechanics are fabulous and intereting to anyone with even a slight interest in computers or coding.The only complaint I have about this game is: I wish it was longer. There are a good handfull of levels, but they only leave you wanting more. There is a small community of mod makers who make more levels, but I've had some difficulty getting them to run."
272,2526,Hauntingly Emersive.
273,2525,"Really enjoyable game. Once you get the blink command, the puzzle really open up. Felt like a boss stringing a bunch of commands together set off by blinking."
274,2525,"A good game. The idea of typing some simple code to interact with the game world is neat and the lenght of the game is jsut right to not let it get stale. Sadly there are a few minor glitches all around, but they are not annoying"
275,2524,"Puzzle game with very satisfying core mechanics. Extremely fun, but the main game is way too short. Game would benefit tremendously from an expansion pack with more levels."
276,2520,Truly unique and charming DOS-Punk puzzle game.  A nice haven of originality.
277,2519,"Programming/hacking are tags I'm drawn to, and this game does it well. The missions are half programming and puzzling, half physics and platforming. Overall I felt it was on the easy side. What it lacks in challenge, it more than makes up for in its style and silently-told story. Make sure to slow down and observe all the details, there are many treats to be found."
278,2518,"I can't really say that this game fit a specific genre, but probably I would say that the best category would be puzzle games.The overall style is super simple; nothing wrong with that; but it became a sort of free pass for indie games, to the point where people do not even try anymore to give a decent look to a game. IF the overall gameplay is good, you may ignore the  elementary graphic; or maybe you can call it a form of minimalist art...I don't really mind, what matter is that the game is moderately fun.You are fundamentally hacking your way to specific objectives; although what I saw in the first few missions is kinda limited. You have a portable hacking device, which simulate a terminal; so you can run commands to do certain things, although there is not much variety. You can see the name of the specific object you can interact with (so camera3, grate1 and  so on), so all you do is to type in terminal the name with a dot and then you can either turn that device on or off, or open and close it. Optionally you can specify for how long the item stay open or off, and that is helpful when you have alarms triggered by how long a door or a camera stay off.Now, this is great, but fundamentally there are flaws: the first is that you already know the name of what you want to access. The second is that we assume that the device can just connect wirelessly; while in the tutorial you need to find plugs; which makes more sense.The third and most enraging one, is that it is not much of a game where you figure out how to bypass something, but it is a time-based game.For example, you have capsules with one time code that goes through pressure pipes; although at times you have lasers that trigger an alarm if you have the capsule go by, without deactivate the laser (which can't be deactivated for more than 3 seconds or the alarm trigger anyway); so you end up - putting down your computer- pull a lever- look at the capsule, and when it is close by, you select the computer so you can interact with it, and send the command.If all goes well, you pass; otherwise the laser trigger and the capsule explode, and you get penalized. While I find this challenging, it is not challenging me to find a solution, but just forcing me to be fast in logging in and out of the computer to send commands to deactivate stuff... and goes without saying that if you are logged in the computer, your visual is kinda obstructed, and require you to be super fast with commands. You can push up arrow to recall a command, so that speed up things, but I am disappointed that the game does not rely on how smart I am at find a solution or write code to bypass something, but instead rely on how fast I can switch between items.The premises are great, but the implementation is a bit lackluster. it would take not much more to implement a sort of simple scripting where you have to time things with wait() and verify sensor states getting their properties (or maybe ping each generically named item to see if that is the one you need to access, instead of reading the name right on top of it).I assumed the game was marketed to the likes that play games like Uplink or other similar hacking games; while it seems to be more of an arcade game, with hacker scenarios.In the end, it is not a bad game, and I recommend it; but the premises are really good, and if you could add a better graphic; maybe VR support and puzzle that are more aimed at solving issue, instead than just being fast with your fingers; that would really make this game the #1 game for hackers-style games.Lots of fun playing it; and it is really easy to get lost in it for a long time"
279,2517,"As ever, Blendo Games are masters of presentation and interesting storytelling, making for a disorienting and immersive thing of beauty.  However, the high complexity can be a potent barrier to entry."
280,2516,Silly bug where the command history on your deck (arrow up) also immediately executes the command makes this unplayable. Seems to be in the game for years looking at the discussions.
281,2515,Fun game with a really great sense of style. I love the houseplants and the three badass protagonists.
282,2514,"Solid, inovative gameplay"
283,2512,I had so much fun playing this game and pretty much didn't stop until I completed it. More of this would be good.
284,2511,"My first encounter with this game was while it was in development. It was being shown in a trailer at a PAX show, and it seemed like it was going to be the first game to allow the player to use programming to solve interactive problems in a FPS. I was pretty excited for that, but after years in development and waiting for the macOS port, I see that it changed a lot from its early vision. What remains is an incredible aesthetic but an easy and short 5 hour game where your band of 3 lady hackers complete a series of virtual heists. There are puzzles, but they are light scripting if you can even call it that. Nothing that feels like programming ever comes into it. You'll ""jack in"" to wall sockets and trigger this and that with keyboard commands, but mostly it follows the tradition of ""find the door trigger that opens the door"". With the twist being that sometimes you have to place a remotely triggered device and work on your timing. There is no multiplayer, despite the introduction of a gameplay style halfway through the game where you have to switch between two characters to cooperatively solve tasks in tandem.The gameplay changes every stage or two, and it doesn't build upon itself necessarily. It's just continually experimenting with ideas and then throwing them away. You're on a train, you're robbing a house, you're in space now. Robots attack your hideout. You're on an airship. A badminton mini-game. All right...I get it, this game wants you to know it's quirky.Anyway, beyond some light brainteasers, this is a game about the visual art. Quadrilateral Cowboy has no dialogue or plot, moving between discrete and disconnected missions with only wah-wah-wah Charlie Brown style dialogue, if any at all. It's strictly visual storytelling. It fitting with the hipster aesthic, the game is set in a fictional 1979 or 1980, with plenty of retro computing artifacts and obvious influences from Wes Andersen's cinematic style.The soundtrack consists of a handful of public domain tunes from the early 20th century (plus a recurring rendition of Claire de Lune) which the player can select from at any time, using a walkman-like portable record-player item. Visually, the game is a cross between dark cyberpunk and an absurdist comedy, similar to JazzPunk. Thanks to the idTech4 engine, it runs at a good frame rate on an old mid-2010 MacBook Pro.I would recommend the game if you are a fan of charming indie efforts, but do not look for a serious programmer-style challenge along the lines of a Zachtronics game. The controls are clumsy, especially when trying to place your deck or TV on the ground. Multiple bugs will affect your gameplay  mostly minor, but in my short playthrough it crashed to the main menu or crashed out of the game entirely more than once. Another bug can cause your character to ""choke from lack of oxygen"" in any outer-space level where you are safely indoors."
285,2510,"My god. It's a short little game, I finished in about 3 hours. But there is a pretty vibrant community making more levels.The concept is brilliant, the game design and thematics are wonderful, there's all sorts of twists and it gradually gets more intense.Unfortunately the entire campaign feels more like a set of tutorial levels- each level introduces a new mechanic and focuses upon it. It doesn't explore all the possible complexities and some combinations of tools/abilities are only used once. But that leaves SO MUCH ROOM for the community to make some really amazing levels.The actual fun I had working out each puzzle reminded me of portal. It's not quite as polished, it's honestly a little rough around the edges, but there's a lot of heart in here and it really makes me happy to see.It's been awhile since I found a game and went around to all my friends going- LOOK AT THIS! DID YOU SEE THAT? WATCH THIS!It's not a game I'm going to forget. It's debatably worth the $19.99... but depending on your budget it might be better to wait. If it's down at $15 or less definately give it a close look- if it's down to $10 or less grab it in a heartbeat. You wont regret it and you'll have a lot of fun."
286,2509,"It's a hacking/puzzle game, pretty straightforward, minimalistic story (though not bad by any means) like all blendo games, this is a game stripped of all fat.I really recommend it for it's interesting mechanics and quite lovely aesthethics."
287,2509,Love the Blendo Games style. Please buy this so we get more of these kinds of games.
288,2508,"The only bad thing about Quadrilateral Cowboy is that it should be longer. A charming, characterful, and fun puzzle game. There are a few different tools and mechanics to use, and the game is really good at introducing them slowly. Sadly just as the levels start to get complex, the game ends. More levels utilising the full tool set would have been great, as the last few missions are the best of the bunch; seeing  you slowly stake out a level, figure out what to do in what order, then put your plan into glorious motion. Three to four hours gameplay is a little short for the price, but everything here is so stylish and fun that I still give the game a hearty recommendation. Maybe make a sequel please, Blendo?"
289,2508,"This is what they thought the future would be like in the 90's.The art style is something executed so flawlessly that you feel immersed in the time period. The short tutorial teaches you everything you need to know, and more. This puzzle game is something new in a world of old, and I have to say, it does it well. This game has many possibilities, and the whole point is not to play by the rules. There aren't any enemies to avoid, except your own poor timing. The gadgets and terminals are right out of a 90's hacker movie. The gameplay is structered, but still feels like you're not locked in. The music score and sound effects are perfectly inserted."
290,2506,"This game is truly incredible.It bundles in amazing aspects, such as retro technology, cyberpunk, hacking, a female protagonist, and a dystopian future with heists and puzzles. I now realize that this sounds like Portal 2. It basically is Portal 2, just more blocky graphics.I have replayed this game 8 times now and every time I discover something new.Sadly, this is Blendo Game's only good game. All the others are knockoffs or just are really bad. Comparing their previous games to Quadrilateral Cowboy is like comparing a used tissue to an assault rifle.I originally pirated this game, but I loved it so much I just HAD to buy the steam version.Amazing gameplay, art style, and music.Thank you, Blendo Games, for this MASTERPIECE."
291,2506,"Another fantastic game, Blendo! Loved learning all the systems and how to operate and control everything to complete these little heists. Wish I had played it sooner! I was confused in the beginning when I saw there was a control key dedicated just for blinking, thought it was just a novelty - first FPS game to have manual eye blinking! But then... whoah :OIf I have any negative things to say it's that there's not more! For me it felt like it was just starting to ramp up once I got all the tools and understood the terminal commands and how to use them more effectively, and then it ended soon after. Still absolutely loved what was there, and it's definitely replayable if you're into speedrunning. Will have to check out the user created levels on the workshop sometime, too bad there's not gobs of them to go through!"
292,2506,"Nice game, but the story is too short"
293,2506,"One of my favourite games in recent memory. The puzzles are fun and challenging, and best of all allow for all the advanced planning you want. Combines hacking and Blendo's signature feel to make something really charming and special. Highly recommended."
294,2505,"Quadrilateral Cowboy is an enjoyable game with a quirky art style. It constantly introduces new and interesting mechanics before you can get bored with any of them. The short campaign (which was approximately 3.5 hours) serves as a great showcase for all the abilities, but I think Quadrilateral Cowboys true potential would be community made maps/heists. The game gives the player amazing tools, but doesnt fully utilize them; Something that would be perfect for community made maps. Unfortunately there is no level editor like in Portal 2 to allow for the small community to produce content without knowing how to fully mod, in external programs. Overall, without a level editor to reach its true potential, Quadrilateral Cowboy offers amazing tools but does not fully utilize them. I would recommend picking this one up on sale."
295,2505,"This game is somewhat reminiscent of Jazzpunk, another indie game. Both have cyberpunk environments, humor scattered everywhere (especially objects), and a charming cast of characters. However, this game is about Hollywood-esque hacking and heists in a cyberpunk's reimagining of the 1980s instead of Bond-ish espionage in a Cold War-stylized future. There's a plot, but it is optional since knowing about it inside the game requires careful observation of the levels.There is a terminal on your portable deck, wherein you will have to type commands to interact with hackable objects. Newbies and people who aren't good at computers shouldn't worry too much since the game provides instructions all the way through the end; there are even signs in the early levels inscribed with examples of said commands and the optional advanced features.If you are tech savvy, a prosumer, programmer, and/or interested in computers, then you'll enjoy the game even more; there are references to old and new technology aplenty, even in the items that are provided. It is possible to finish some levels with only one command and a bit of going around them. This is due to the in-game terminal (not the debug console) allowing basic pipes for commands; for those who don't know, this allows for combining multiple commands into one. There are a few other advanced CLI features in there, but I'd suggest playing the game to find out more about them.In conclusion, this is a phenomenal indie game with a good albeit optional plot, peculiar and interesting gameplay, great retro cyberpunk-ish atmosphere, and chock full of pop culture-laden subtle and blatant humor. A must-play, for sure."
296,2505,"To sum it up: Brilliant.No fancy graphics. No nonlinear open world. Most objectives have just one solution. No motion capture, no voice acting, no HD textures, no HDR lighting, no integration to central online servers, no trendy gimmicks, no pandering to the lowest common denominator.Despite the game's outward simplicity, the gameplay is fun and challenging, and has more hacker cred to it than Watchdogs2. The story, shown (not told) by little more than crudely textured polygons and a few sound effects, is not your latest Hollywood thriller, but is far from bland. I did not learn all the playable characters' names until more than halfway through the game, yet I feel I learned alot about them from their style of problem solving. While many triple-A games often make you feel that you are playing a glorified thug with fancy toys, this game gives you the role of highly ambitious, intelligent, meticulously calculated (and only slightly insane) lifelong learners."
297,2504,"I don't exactly know how to describe QC. It's a very charming, very engaging puzzle game. But not like you think. It's sort of like Portal, but... different. There's some super basic pseudocode programming involved, but the game holds your hands pretty good to explain how things work.  The story is told through your interactions with the world, and the old-timey soundtrack (playable via in game records - old timey I suspect to use some royalty free tunes) fits the missions well, though I did get mad and throw a virtual radio across the room once or twice when I got tired of the song.If you like things like TIS-100 or Human Resource Machine or Shenzen I/O - definitely give this one a look. It's oozing with character. I just wish it were longer."
298,2504,"Truly fantastic, heartwarming story that doesnt say a single word of dialouge to you. Neat game mechanics that come one right after the next with no filler inbetween it is short, sweet, and gets the job done fabulously. If you are into anything 1980s, spy stuff, dystopian present/future, having lifelong friends, or even just making a robotic arm shoot a gun, this game is for you."
299,2504,"A game with class.  Extreme class.Beautiful environments, clear spatial representation, a fusion of aesthetic eye candy and interactive player mechanics.  The heists and gadgets are accessible and exciting, the tools are funcitonal, programmable, and tactically deployed with ease.  You will enjoy using the tools to gain access to the building's systems and loot, loot loot.The game certainly delivers on those promises.  But if you really take the time to poke around and use all your senses, you will also find a subtle and understated story about 3 living characters that will touch you.  It is there if you open your eyes.  You will be guided by beautiful and interactive artwork, flavorful yet minimalistic text snippets, and an extremely tasteful score of classic music.Its gameplay will definitely not let you down, but if your measurement is ""Can games be art?"" this one gets a 10/10."
300,2504,very good game. very fun and enjoyable to play. love it :)
301,2504,Makes you feel like a hacker-cowboy. Best quasi-hacking game since Uplink.
302,2504,"I didn't know it would be so satisfying to type commands into a computer to open grates, disable security, and move a little robot through vents. This is a fantastic puzzle game that requires you to observe the area, plan how you'll reach the objective, and put it into execution.In addition to this, this game has the typically wonderful Brendon Chung flair of worldbuilding. He leaves a breadcrumb trail of story and lore but only enough to keep you wondering and thinking about the characters and the story and what world they live in. If you played his prior games, you'll know what I'm talking about. The elliptical narrative that is reminiscent of Wong Kar Wai movies kept me on hook for 4 hours.I'd say this game is definitely worth $20."
303,2503,you get to buy wetware from a catyou get to listen to classical music while you control a remotely operated gunyou get to download brainsyou get to launch safes between skyscrapers using a fanwhat more could you want?10/10
304,2503,"Honesty i love the game. Although it goes around between 2 or 3 different gameplay mechanics that change the whole game instead of doing a deus ex pull of giving you several ways to complete an objective with a single one, its still fascinating. The ending really isn't much more difficult than the rest of the game if at all anyways, and sometimes it feels like if the levels are too short and simple like to take advantage of all the tools that you unlock by the late game. But in aesthetic, storytelling, and audio design i really love the game.I paid about what. 10 bucks? i dont know if its worth the 20 that i think the full price is but if its 15 or below you are really gonna get a very nice experience. Specially with such a pretty ending."
305,2503,"Heaps of fun, with a really bizarre aesthetic that I found appealing."
306,2503,"Fun hacking and timing based puzzles and beautiful style, but unexpectedly developed a relatable story between the 3 best friends / partners in crime main characters. I would have been friends with these characters. STEM majors, robots, badminton??? I almost teared up at the ending."
307,2502,"It's a decent concept but never gets off the ground. Unlike the terminal hacker sims it's frequently compared to, your goal in each level is just to use the mechanic exactly as it's presented to you, and most of the losses you experience will occur because of the wonky physics engine or the game not clearly explaining which devices you can only disable for set intervals; rather than needing to actually rethink and refine your code. There's a particularly exhausting level in which you have to wait MINUTES at a time for a quadrupedal drone to shamble across a plain room to the mission objective, after which your completing or repeating the entire mission depends on a physics object whose trajectory you can't telegraph landing in the right place.Halfway through, the gameplay changes completely and no longer includes the hacking element at all; becoming a thoroughly generic and uninteresting timing-based strategy platformer like a clunkier Braid.Would not recommend, especially not to someone who loved Uplink and Hacknet and is looking for the next big thing - this isn't it."
308,2500,"Short satisfying game about living in;Present Day, heh... Present Time! Hahahahahahaha!7/10:pope gabe broke down my door while blasting some 30sec flosstradamus drop"
309,2499,JUST PLAY IT!
310,2499,"props best hacking sim. really good puzzle game graphics are kinda  but the puzzles are nice, porps better getting it in a sale"
311,2499,"Pretty cool hacking/puzzle game.  Gadgets you get are really cool and arn't just one offs for a certain puzzle; in some cases to solve a puzzle you'll need every single one to pass it.  Pitty the game is so short, but the workshop has a few extra levels."
312,2499,"In short: You looking at this game? Crack your knuckles and bust out your cosset player and Buy it. You wont regret it!! This game stands out from the crowd.  Its a unique game mechanic which might be a little dawnting for some, its a breath of fresh air.. Starting off with simple commands to strings of code.. Ok maybe not strings since its limited to 3 commands at a time but still.... Whilst short, at only around 5.5 hrs. Its well worth the money. THe air style my deter some folks with its very basic blocky vector art... Even so i do enjoy it.The ONLY Negitive i have about since game is towards the ending.... WTF was that all about? I won't spoil anything (and no its nothing game breaking or something that should stray you away from this game) but really? A sudden change of gameplay was a little unexpected.. Granted its only for a couple of missions but still... Kinda broke the flow a little.Oh and story is a non excistant (kinda like my spelling!) We're just dropped into the game and off we go.. All we know is that we're friends from School days and we hack stuff for money. Not a deal breaker but a little clarification would have been nice.Over all its a lovely little game. And HIGHLY Reccomend you try it for your self :)"
313,2499,it is a fun game but there is no replayablity and it only takes 4 hours to beat the whole game it stinks because the game had so much potential :(
314,2499,"This game is absolutely fantastic. If you are worried about the use of hacking, command lines, programming (i.e. if you have zero experience with those sorts of things) then you have absolutely nothing to worry about. The game provides newbs with tons of instructions via various notes and signs hanging around. Especially in the early levels that tell you basically EXACTLY what to type.Unlike other games in the ""hacker"" genre, this game is more about heists. So instead of just sitting at a computer typing commands, cracking passwords, decrypting files, etc, you will be using a portable computer deck to hack your way through doors, vents, security cameras, laser fields, etc.The beauty of the game is that if you have zero programming experience whatsoever, you will still be able to play and enjoy this game using only a handful of simple commands. On the other hand, if you have dabbled in programming or are a full-fledged programming nerd, there are optional/advanced programming features to play with, such as creating your own batch files, which the game remembers, even between levels.One of the most original puzzle games I've played in a while! Worth full price!7) A classic, essential, and/or must-buy game that is absolutely worth full price.6) A solid good game that is worth the full price.5) A pretty good game that may or may not be quite worth full price.4) An alright game, but opinions are likely to strongly differ on the game's value.3) A bit rough, but with some interesting or redeeming qualities. Purchase with care!2) Quite rough. You may find something to like, but brace yourself. Purchase with care!1) Broken, unplayable, or otherwise impossible to recommend."
315,2498,"I was blown away how good this game is! It's a great and unique retro style approach to a cyberpunk netrunner topic. It has all the things you'd expect from a netrunner: portable deck, typing commands, hacking, remote control, writing scripts, augmentations etc.The game becomes insanely better once you learn the ropes as you see that you can beat each level with a single (yet long) command. If you plan and execute it perfectly it gives you an amazing feeling of flow and a sense of perfection.I highly recommend it to anyone interested in cyberpunk, netrunning, hacking or indie games! Grabbed it for 20 euros and turned out to be one of best money spent."
316,2498,"There's a special place in my heart for hacking games, and this one is basically the best I've seen, and I love it to death"
317,2498,"I didn't know what to expect when I bought this game, especially since Blendo Games' last game, 30 Flights of Loving, didn't resonate with me. But the creators really seem to have perfected their storytelling craft with this game. That said, if you don't take time to stop and smell the roses and appreciate the environmental details, the story might be lost on you.Where this game really excels, however, is with the unique gameplay. This game is like nothing else I've played. I love the sense of achievement you get when you solve a puzzle; you feel like a 1337 h4x0r. What's more, each stage is nothing like the last. Just when you begin to get comfortable with the game systems it's teaching you, the game throws them out the window and moves on to something entirely different. It's a really daring design choice. In some respects, it leaves you feeling like the game only scratched the surface of its full potential, but it certainly keeps the game fresh."
318,2498,"Awesome game which i recommend if you like computers, robots, CLI and such!"
319,2497,"Oh my god! It is unbelievable. I just finnished the game and it is incredible.The story, the gameplay mechanics, the funky art style and great soundtrack. Buy it!!!While the main gameplay mechanic centres around this psuedocode style language, you don't need to understand programming to play the game but it helps in some of the later levels!10/10 By far the best game I've Ever played!"
320,2497,"Fantastic puzzles that turn actual, real coding into what action movies make it out to be. The whole world is filled with loving detail as well, you can tell a lot of time was put in to every aspect of the game. The whole thing is just an incredibly satisfying, charming game to play."
321,2497,it's lovely
322,2496,"Good mood, good fun, good mix of logical and physical elements in the puzzle solving. Doesn't overstay its welcome but feels like I got my money's worth."
323,2496,"This is a very nice little puzzle game. I had a lot of fun with it. Made me feel like a Linux spy hacker in the 80s. How many games can say that? I also enjoyed that protagonists are all female. If you're already interested, definetly consider at <10 dollars."
324,2496,"The puzzles aren't actually all that difficult, but it's still a lot of fun being able to deploy and program your own equipment for heists. If you've ever had fun messing around with robotics, then you'll probably enjoy this game. If you've ever wanted to mess around with robotics, then try this game out and see if you like it!"
325,2495,Ok it has simple graphics.But somehow it creates a special charm.I like it and love it.The game contains elements of gameplay you probably never experienced in any other game.It contains a little humor and nice puzzles.Sadly there is not much that explains the story itself. (or i did not figure it out yet)
326,2495,"Very unique game, with a very unique narrative!All thanks to the developers!"
327,2495,"This game is so much fun! I only have a little bit of gameplay because I only just got it, but I'm enjoying it wholeheartedly."
328,2495,"Good level design overall, but you will hardly be stuck more than 30s. Don't come to QC for a puzzle game but rather for a cocktail of moderately difficult platform/reflexion. I had a good time on that game.I unfortunately can't recommend that game due to a VERY excessive price (~20) for such a short experience (<4h to complete). I got it for ~10 during the Halloween 2017 sales and still think it's a bit overpriced. If you have the chance to grab it for around 7, then you would have a good deal :)I also would like to precise I was expecting that game for such a long time, so much I was regularly visiting the webpage to check the release date since it was up."
329,2495,"This game is in desperate need of play-testing.After only having played it for 1hr, I've managed to break it in a number of ways... I'm not bosting, if anything I feel stupid because I just want to get past these things so I can see what else this game has to offer.I've spent more time trying to figure out ""what is the most predictable way to complete a level"", than just doing what I want, and solving the puzzles along the way.I've also had to completely re-start my ""career"" from scratch because I closed a door and it never reopened.Look, it's a good idea... no, it's a great idea!... but I'm finding it hard to have fun.edit: now I can't press [up] to select previous commands without them running, I've verified game files, there's something seriously wrong here, but I can't find any other negative reviews that say the same... I'm very confused, I think real-life is a better option right now."
330,2495,"Overall good game, different with lots of fun little mini games, provided you like to type/program.  Only bad thing for me was the look to the characters, made the game go from interesting to childish everytime you see them.  Wish they had a on/off big head mode"
331,2490,"Excellent! This is a game about puzzles, hacking and heists.  This game asks you to figure out the puzzle, and then translate the solution into the correct code.  I've played only a few hours so far, and I'm having a blast!  Highly recommend!"
332,2488,"I adore this game. The mechanics are fun and challenging, and encourage creativity. The minimalist graphics do nothing to take away from the charm of the game, or its three main characters. I especially loved the attention to detail - like the titles of books you find, which were sometimes used as clues and sometimes as jokes."
333,2487,"I enjoyed Quadrilateral Cowboy a lot.  The aesthetic was great and the missions were fun.Some hacking games give you a point-and-click GUI.  Those seem simplistic to me.  Some hacking games bog you down in a pure command line.  Those feel like work.  I think that this game was very well balanced in that respect.I like to approach games like this without knowing anything about them because they're such a joy to discover as you go.  That said, some specifics on what the game is about if you don't mind more details: Essentially, you pull off a series of heists and you have various little programmable gadgets to help you do so.  Sometimes there are time limits.  Sometimes you are working in parallel with yourself.  In the end, each mission felt very satisfying.And a couple of things to help you enjoy the game and not get stuck like I did exactly once: If you're into exploration, I highly recommend reading everything with text on it. There were some wine bottles with clever labels in the very first intro mission, and those got me started enjoying the fine print during the rest of the game.I had a lovely time and I can already think of several friends that I know will enjoy it as well."
334,2486,"This game has a really cool concept. You type in commands and control different kinds of devices. There are a few ways to solve the different puzzles. My only problem is with how short it is. It introduces a concept, there is one level that showcases that feature and then it moves on. After a few hours, you're introduced to all the concepts and then the game ends. There seems to be a couple features that the game never brings up that I never found a use for. Like the weevil magnet. I never used this, and I'm not sure why it is in the game. The story is kind of interesting, it's a few friends working towards something. To be honest though, I was mostly just interested in solving the puzzles and wasn't paying attention to what the overall plot was.If 3-5 hours of chill out puzzle solving is worth whatever price this is at the time, get it. But that's all you're getting. It seems like this was expected to take off with user made mods in the steam workshop, but there's nothing there a year after release."
335,2486,"Best programming game I played in a while. Just wished it had more content, but as always, Blendo Games creating amazing games with fantastic design overall <3 <3"
336,2484,"Great game with almost entirely environment based story telling. Made me a bit motion sick, but the challenging puzzles and inovative design made it worth it."
337,2484,"This game was brilliant, the coding is intuitive and the levels are all well designed, If I had a complaint about the game itself its that it isnt long enough. I really wish this game had a bigger workshop community because I would love to play more levels."
338,2482,"I love this game, but I should note it is short. About 6 hours of my game play were on the story line in the game, the other 3.9 hours were in community made maps. This game feels like an advanced portal in the terms of game mechanics. There's just so many different challenges you can make with these mechanics that map builders have infinite map designs. I should note that creating a map may be difficult for people new to map building, but those with experience might be able to catch on immediately. The only thing this game needs is a larger community workshop base, and it would be 10/10."
339,2482,"I'm in a weird place with this game.For one, I love anything cyberpunk, and breaking into buildings and hacking their systems command line style is so cyber punk.ButI HATE the aesthetic. The blocky people, the vector look, I just cannot take it seriously, so I have a lot of trouble staying in the game. It just doesn't suit the feel at all, and I get mood whiplash every time I look at one of my rediculous looking comrades.If you can geet past the goofy aesthetic, there is a great cyperpunk hacking game buried beneath it, but it's a challenge to do that for me so I cannot fault anyone else for not being able to."
340,2480,"This game was very suprising. It might not look like too much from the pictures and explanation, but this game can actually tell a story and provide some fun gameplay without even having the characters speak to you. You can actually get an idea of the characters backstory through the images and cutscenes. The gameplay was fun, and requires a good amount of tact. Absolutely loved it."
341,2480,i  mannige to make it work had to delete doomconfig.cfg
342,2479,Quite a beautiful concept. Wouldn't be the same without the music. Fun!
343,2479,"At the dawn of the 1980's, three women in STEM, and best friends forever, moonlight as freelance ""hacker extraordinaire"" cyber-criminals while their men (and most of the world) sleep. (although one of them appears to be single) This is their story."
344,2479,"Loved this game from start to ending, couldn't get enough of it. couldn't recomend it enough. Over all amazing game, even better game machanics."
345,2478,"Great style, lovely characters, world and feel. Love the first person and VR-ish bent. Developer is super responsive in the community. Really good replay value as this is the first game whose time-trials actually felt like an accomplishment of both programming ability, planning and movement."
346,2477,nutt
347,2477,"Super interesting ideas, similar to a jazzpunk aesthetic! This whole game seems like it could be pretty fun, however, I ultimately didn't feel like there was any engaging narrative or plot that made this interesting.I think the game as a whole is also marred by the noclip feature that's added on, because it makes the game feel a little too easy. This game, in my own personal opinion, isn't as funny or engaging as jazzpunk, and was wayy too long.That being said, the hacking mechanic is  genius, anyone who knows coding will surely get a kick out of this."
348,2477,"Quadrilateral Cowboy is a great game. It comes into your life, it says what it wants to say, and then it's done. If Ubisoft collectathons bother you with their repetition and filler content, this does not have that problem. It does not outstay it's welcome.Some people have said it's too short, and I can see that, but I can also appreciate a game that doesn't try to waste my time. Each puzzle in this game feels new and interesting, building from stuff you've done before but keeping it fresh. Not much of a story, in the typical sense, but great environmental storytelling and worldbuilding.I wouldn't describe it as a funny game, exactly, but it definitely doesn't take itself too seriously. Lighthearted, maybe.This game is engrossing, and if I was bitter when it ended too soon for me, I suppose that's actually praise. Many games, especially puzzle games (I'm looking at you, The Witness) leave me exhausted by the end. This felt more like Portal 1; nonstop entertainment for a single sitting.If that sounds like your kind of thing, get it!"
349,2477,Amazing game!
350,2477,A masterpiece. We need more game like this.
351,2475,:)
352,2474,"Good game concept, etc., but like people say: way too short, and my critique: poorly optimized. My FPS should not drop below 60 in a game this simple!"
353,2473,"Finishing this game is like getting a Philosophy degree. Your mind is opened, you think differently, and you understand the everything better (or is that worse?). You fall in love with the world the bit more, but hate it more all the same, all at the same time. You become a marvelous person, only to find yourself unemployed. You see the potential, but there's not quite much you can do. Saudade and longing grow on you, helplessly, day by day. Also, great excuse to justify your HHKB or random expensive custom mechanical keyboards and appear tech-savvy."
354,2473,It's pretty good.
355,2472,"I waited 3 years for this game to come out.It's great, but it feels really short for its price."
356,2471,"this is fun, and not as hard as coding really is, 9/10"
357,2471,"Great game.  Unique spin on the familiar cyberpunk genre.  Setting and characters are endearing and memorable despite the lack of dialogue.  Level design is tight and communicative. Puzzles are interesting, but not longer or more complex than they need to be.  I did feel like the game could have used one more BIG mission, with multiple paths all tying together the various techniques and gadgets you've aquired throughout the game, but in the end I'm always happier to be left wanting more than to have a game full of filler to grind through."
358,2470,Lots of cool ideas but pretty short. If you want a programmery artsy game with some actual gameplay in it then this will be your jam.
359,2469,"I really wanted to like this game. There are a lot of cool concepts and gadgets that you get as the game progresses, but I found myself wondering when the tutorial was going to end. About an hour in, I realized that this was the game. Unfortunately, the puzzles are very discrete - they never really build off of each other. And they are so simple. I spent more time handling the glitches and poor game mechanics than I did actually thinking about how to solve the puzzles. I think that if you go in wanting a quick, fun game on a rainy afternoon, this may be a contender. But at $20, I think that you can find ones much more satisfying than this one."
360,2469,"Quadrilateral Cowboy unexpectedly became my favorite game in recent years. I think part of the reason why is that I didn't have very defined expectations. Another reason is that I've been pulled away from longer games simply because of circumstance. So you could say that what Quadrilateral Cowboy actually offered was exactly what I needed at the time of playing it. And what it offers is some of the most subtle, intimate storytelling in gaming intertwined with what I would also call subtle, intimate puzzles. Puzzles with clever solutions but in which the solution is not the most important element.The highlight of this game is the physicality of the objects you interact with. It is the internal consistency of the tools at your disposal. If it's true that the game never combines all it's elements to present you with truly complicated puzzle challenges (a la Portal, The Witness or Stephen's Sausage Roll), it is also true that the game doesn't really aim for that kind of brainteaser. It has just as much puzzle as is necessary to make you feel in it's world, breaking into things, hacking weird stuff, downoading brain content, sticking it up the corporate overlord. Even though many of the puzzles are  simple, I will never forget how they made me feel. As the story of the three girls progressed, I became part of this rag-tag band of absurd hacker-heros in a way that will stay with me for a long time.So that's why it has become a most memorable game for me. It is short and sweet. It is subtle and feels profound without posturing or ridiculous gestures of intellectual grandeur (looking at you, Bioshock Infinite). It has great gameplay that you can interact with at the pace of a narrative sensation that encompasses you (never do you need to stop and think for a duration of time in which you are no longer a character and become instead a solver, a detached entity with a notepad and a brain).It is little escapade into a world I wish existed. And I'm sad it doesn't."
361,2467,"The kind of game you should store on a CD somewhere on a bookshelf.  Simply brilliant, yet short.Watch_dogs done right."
362,2465,"Quadrilateral Cowboy is a great puzzle game, evoking (for me) elements of Portal, Talos Principle, as well as more simulation based experiences such as the recent indie title Jalopy (which you can tell I have also been playing recently).  Puzzle solving satisfaction emerges from the well constucted pacing of puzzle element introduction.  All this takes place in unique and stylized world that successfully mingling elements of Bladerunner, Robocop, Half-Life, and Snowcrash while contributing its own particular flair.  9/10"
363,2464,"A simply amazing game. I was just pulled in. This game is a master piece. I can go on and on about how I love this game. The game play feels good, and it feels like you're hacking stuff, controlling robots and guns with just console cammands, but it's not overly complicated like in real life. So anyone can play without having to have to much skill. The lighting was amazing, best light in a video game ever, and it runs on and engine from 2004 was mind blowning. I didn't think you could make such great physics from an engine that old. The story is great too, a story told with no words, but full of emotion. You feel so trusting in your two friends right away. This game is a master piece and is just so perfect. I only have one problem with the game, that is that I wish there was more. I would like to see a sequel to this. Besides that this game is amazing and you should buy it now."
364,2463,Professor Approved!
365,2463,"This is quirky, which I suppose makes up the other adjective I'd use to describe it. Which is tedious. Some of the puzzles really make you think and retrace your steps. Definitely worth the price."
366,2463,"Simple to figure out but complex enough to be fun, amazingly fun! My only complaint is that there wasn't enough and I mean that as an actual complaint. There should have been a few more levels at the end that truly combined and tested me with all the tools I had learned. instead it just ended after the first hard level.This is the first half of a  perfect  game."
367,2462,Love the game but would like if the game was longer!
368,2462,"I always wanted to be a hacker, but I never wanted my feelings hacked in the process."
369,2462,9.5/10 Fantastic game with clever puzzles. You get through the puzzles by coding your way through and using gadgets to bypass obstacles.
370,2461,It's short so you've got to figure out whether it's worth your money or not judging by how long it is but if you are up for a short adventure involving hacking and solving puzzles then you are going to love this game. You will also have to realise that the graphics aren't particularly great or cutting edge but for the art style they stand out and in my opinion it's well worth buying and it's easy to 100 percent as well so it has that going for it.
371,2461,"The game reminds me of the sort of ""programming"" I did when I was young. QBASIC or Lego Mindstorms sort of logic. Simple, straightforward, and powerful. It was great to see it in the conext of a retro, cyberpunk, puzzle game."
372,2461,"This game made me feel like a hightech rogue agent! Great setting and storytelling. Gameplay is quite original even without the coding aspect. The coding basically felt like pressing buttons but instead of pressing buttons you need to type words down to achieve simple results. But then it got quite interesting with more mechanics like assigning functions to blinks.I can understand people feeling the game is short, but it was just right for me. Game feels very well made. It's kinda buggy though. I had multiple crashes. I had to quit a level and get back sometimes as the game state can get messed up. I broke the physics engine, got stuck somewhere, or just kept flying in the same direction without pressing anything (only in photo mode).I didn't mind the bugs too much since the game made me feel awesome. Recommended at any price."
373,2461,Beautifully subtle
374,2461,"I love puzzle games with an aspect of coding. I just managed to crash the game while writing an in-game script to fire the casegun automatically, and that just makes me giddy with the possibilities~"
375,2461,"The game worked for a while, then when I shut it down and tried to replay it the launcher kept crashing.  I tried all recommended methods for fixing this, but none worked.  I contacted the company that made it, but still have not received a response."
376,2460,"I think there are quite a few reviews that said the same thing, overall its a great little game with a lot of clever puzzles, but I do wish that it would get progressively more complex and let the player utilise all the mechanics to solve even more complex puzzles but again, that never really took place.However I did enjoy playing this game just the way it is now, just wish there were more to it."
377,2459,"For a game that lasts a few hours it is surprsingly atmospheric and a whole lot of fun. There isn't a large story besides what you piece to gether from photographs or scraps of paper, but it somehow managed to have an oddly touching ending. If something new like this is worth the money, then pick it up."
378,2458,Just wow (will write something more elaborate later)
379,2457,"Very fun game, lots of strategy to it, I like the casing mode you use for the last few levels, really makes it feel like you're setting up a real heist.Quirky graphics, not much of a story but it's there and enjoyable, I think it's an overall good game.Only complaint is it's a little short for 20$. But I don't regret spending it."
380,2457,"Whimsical heist game with some clever hacking mechanics, set in a quirky, blocky world (the game begins with your character on a hoverbike, listening to 12"" records on a record walkman).Typical Blendo Games feels (Gravity Bone, Thirty Flights of Loving), plus great gameplay! And hax!"
381,2456,"Quadrilateral Cowboy was a fun experience.If you never heard of this game, you may be confused about the world this game plays in. It's 1980 and you ride with your flying motorcycles to your first heist. Yup. Exactly. Flying motorbikes.Even though this game falls on the short side and could've used more narrative, it felt very engaging to me. I really wasn't into the ""speedrunning aspect"" of the game, but this can gladly be ignored.In the end i had a lot of fun with this title.The best ""Short, 20 bucks and released in 2016""-game i have played."
382,2456,"Initially felt very promising, but everything after the intro fell flat. Cons:No overarching story or subplots to follow, only out-of-place recreation sequences attempting to add depth to characters. Simplistic puzzles where the main mechanic appears to be speed running, pivoting around the gadget-of-the-day. No real depth to puzzles requiring a multitude of techniques to overcome, or replayability via trying different approaches. Perhaps most disappointing was the hacking element, which was really more of hacking theatre. Imagine driving a controller with command line inputs and that's the gist of it.Pros:A minimalistic art style paired with a music theme I highly enjoyed. Many of the stability issues seem to have been addressed.Recommendations: Hope for a writer & level designer + more time I suppose. With that, if you like feeling like a hacker and enjoy speedrunning, look for this on sale. If you're looking for good puzzle or coding elements keep moving."
383,2455,Freaking love it. I will play every game this man makes.
384,2454,Interesting concept...I guessHard to figure out if its a simulation or you are actually attempting a bank heist half the time. Missions are fun however you are allowed to noclip and fly throughout the level allowing access to obstacles before event finding them. Failure doesn't even feel all that bad due to the fact that the only repercussion is a respawn back to the beginning. The story is unmotivating at best. There is nothing to tie the missions together other than assembling the introduction computer. Feels off and incomplete.
385,2454,"I love this game. Its full of loving touches, you can tell it was made by hand! The central mechanic in the game is so pleasing to play with. Im going to make a mod for this game when I have time, it seems like the potential for modding/ making your own heist scenarios was baked into the games concept. Love love love this little game. May be short, may have flaws, but Im grateful the creator birthed this world/experience/game for me to enjoy."
386,2453,"TL;DR the game feels half done.The mechanics are great and make for interesting puzzles but don't always expand on the concepts: the first half of the game pretty thoroughly explores the use of your deck (which is more command line interface than programming), but the second half seems to only scratch the surface of the multiple heister possibilities before giving you all the abilities on one character anyways. Multiple weevers, or using the weever and autocase simultaneously, are never explored even though the tools and commands hint at the possibility. Workshop support really SHOULD make up for some of these flaws, but six months later only a handful of levels even exist. The plot and backstory stuff feels like it's building up to something big, but it never gets there which is unusual given the developer's past works. The game does a good job of establishing the basics of who these people you're playing as are in between levels, but there's never a moment where these relationships are tested or a true antagonist emerges. Some really cool things happen, and then they just stop happening. Apparently you're playing the first two years of a 15+ year career before flashing forward to old age in the epilogue, where they show off all the equipment you would've gotten. SUCH a tease... On a technical level the game runs fine, but a couple of level breaking bugs forced me to close and reopen the game in order to reattempt the level.After the reputation built up from Gravity Bone and Thirty Flights of Loving, I was just expecting more than the game gave me. If you're a puzzle fanatic and just want to tool around with some interesting mechanics, then by all means go for it. If you're expecting this to grab your attention in any other way, move on."
387,2453,What a GREAT game !!!!
388,2452,This may be one of the most beautiful games I have ever played.
389,2452,"Not sure what I expected, but I was kind of let down.It's basically a bunch of puzzles that the game wants you to speedrun. And speedrunning puzzles isn't really fun.Maybe the game gets better towards the end, but it doesn't look like it."
390,2452,"I personally loved this game, it was challenging, and innovative."
391,2452,"I loved the aesthetic and flow of Thirty Flights Of Loving but I wasn't sure it would translate to fun gameplay in a more serious game, so I was really pleasantly surpised by the open and engaging puzzle style in Quadrilateral Cowboy. The cinematic style and funny, beautiful moments of exploration from Blendo's previous games are still there but the game is super playable and dynamic and really fun."
392,2452,"What started out for me as a time waster turned into much more. This is easily one of my favorite games. The simple hacking is fun and makes you feel very elite. When things work out just right, you get a huge feeling of accomplishment. My only negative critique for this game is that it is very short and there are only 4 items in the workshop . I'd be excited to play a sequel or literally anything that will give me more of this style of gameplay.Also.. The story almost made me cry."
393,2451,"Great game except a little short for the price. Perfect mix of ""hacking"" simulation, adventure and puzzles."
394,2451,"Man, this game. I LOVE IT. I have so much feelings for it I don't even know how to articulate them. It's in the atmosphere. The mood. The tactile, satisfying feeling of every button press, every switch and every toggle. The music. The sound effects. The quirkiness of that cat that sells you things and then give birth to a bunch of kittens and then it's a different cat the next time you visit the shop.I love the seamless worldbuilding, the way everything is shown, not told. I felt so immersed, invested and attached to the game world and the characters, even though they never said a word. It's probably BECAUSE they never said a word, and as a player, I gave them words, I filled in the blanks and interpreted their personality and character. Maybe that's why I felt so attached.The puzzles never got too hard. But I like it that way, it keeps the game going at a steady pace. Even the minor bugs, mostly clipping issues, didn't irritate me as much as I thought it would, and I usually HATE bugs like that.I've finished this game two days ago, and I'm still thinking about it. I think I'll replay this over and over. It has a special place in my heart now.I want to see more games set in this universe, more stories told."
395,2451,"it's a cool game that actually lets you feel like a hackerunlike the other blendo shorts this is an actual ""game"" game and it's about 5 hours longwith this being in the style of gravity bone and thirty flights of loving you would think the plot would be confusing, but the game has a very clear plot centered around three women, one of them being your character, who are private contractors that preform heiststhe game has a very... odd style though. lots of purposely missing textures and developer settings to enhance the old computer cyberpunk feel."
396,2451,"I found the game a little on the short side, but I love the concept and the puzzles were great fun."
397,2451,"Maybe I over-hyped this game for myself. I saw its announcement years ago, got very excited, and then put it on the back burner.  I rediscovered it this week, but thought it was a little overpriced for what I expected to be a 5-7 hour game. Watched a video of the first 10 minutes and decided it was perfect for me, and to go for it.Regret.That's the main feeling I get after playing this game.Pros:Good visuals, given the engine and graphical style.Gameplay feels ImmersiveCons:Short. Really short. Even shorter than I expected. HLTB said 6.5 hours, 5.5 rushed. I didn't rush the game and even idled some, and I still came out at 4.9 hours.The story is just awful.  You get the general picture but there's no detail to really drag you in, or feel involved. It doesn't tie the levels together whatsoever. It just feels like you're doing the next level because.. it's next. The story goes from hacking to getting attacked to flying. There's nothing that ties it together.. except maybe sisterhood? I didn't feel it. They're friends. Who  cares?Buggy. Even months after release, issues the dev thinks they've fixed keep happening. Visual bugs, bugs while restarting a level, bugs with the deck so you can't issue commands properly, which persists through saves and reloads. Bugs everywhere.Sound felt very cheap at times.Mods? This game has been out for 5 months and has 4 mods on the Steam Workshop. This isn't the dev's fault, but if they wasted time integrating the workshop for this, someone is at fault.Puzzles go from easy to hard to easy. There's no consistency whatsoever, and the game does a horrible job of explaining some mechanics. Most are easy to understand, but if you miss a detail, it gets confusing quickly.Overall, it's a neat idea but it doesn't execute its goal very well. I'd give it a 6/10.  If you were intrigued by the coding concept, don't waste your time. It feels more like fine tuning someone else's code than writing your own."
398,2448,"Gigantic waste of potential. The basic hacking and heist experience is fun, but it gets ruined by the addition of fiddly things like the weever and the launcher. The game never stops feeling like a tutorial. Buggy as hell - physics regularly malfunctioned, items disappeared, the deck interface would sometimes bug out, and crashes left and right. Lazy as hell art style and storytelling. I had been following this game for three years, and it's such a disappointment."
399,2447,"Absolutely great puzzle game for combining elements of (very light) actual terminal input, planning, and exploration. The music, art, and story all work together well, and help it accomplish its overall goal. Really the only problem is a lack of content, but hopefully more will come out of the creators or mods. I made it through the game in about three hours, and probably could've gone faster if I was a bit more clever. The lack of levels makes it seem like you don't get to use all of the tools you're given to their full potential, but that potential is vast if this game gets a following."
400,2447,A fun game with an interesting story and engaging core gameplay. It is kinda short so maybe get it on sale.
401,2447,"A completely marvelous work. The gameplay is engaging, solving each puzzle feels like you really accomplished something. Every little bit of the world that we get to see is amazing, and I couldnt help but fall in love with the characters. It was exactly the game I wanted it to be, because it was open to being whatever game I wanted."
402,2447,Quadrilateral Cowboy is cool puzzle game with a very unique art style. The story pieces surronding each level build an interesting world. I only wisjh there were additional complex levels like the final level to test all the skills you aquire. It left me wanting more.
403,2447,"Very nice little quirky story, simple presentation but nice atmosphere and gameplay.  Would recommend to anyone wishing for a short little cyberpunk game to play in an afternoon or so."
404,2447,It's like Portal meets Cyberpunk retro fun!
405,2447,It's better than a kick to the head.
406,2447,"While I would have liked a few more ""endgame"" levels that took advantage of all the different puzzle elements, this is still a beautiful game with some amazing environmental storytelling."
407,2447,"This game was absolutely amazing. I play it off and on, but the story was just so great. This game is a little gem all on its own. The amount of control you actually have on objects in a level is so awesome! Definitely recommend a playthrough. 10/10"
408,2446,"Fantastic game with well designed puzzles leaning towards the easier end, but the main mechanic frustrates easily. The need to pass every command as a line of code can really slow things down if your typing speed isn't great. Still greatly recommended though."
409,2446,"This game features unique gameplay, visual design, and ideas. However, its stand-out feature for me is its subtle storytelling which must be found by the player and is endearing without resorting to cliched devices.Its shortcoming is that the levels feel too simple leaving the game very short of its potential. This simplicity can be blamed on the fact that little is done to combine the mechanics which are gradually taught as the game progresses. It is as if you are learning to be a magician but instead of combining the new tricks you master to perform more daring and difficult tasks, you're simply learning one new trick while almost entirely abandoning the previous one."
410,2446,They've never made games like these anymore.
411,2446,"Very unique gameplay although it's a little on the short side. Story is sparse but it goes some fun places. The world, the gameplay, and all the little quirks are more than enough to earn a hearty recommendation from me."
412,2446,Great game with an interesting style. Only downside is you gain all these neat tools to use throughout the game but can only use them all on the last couple of levels.
413,2446,"One of the best indie games I've ever played. Love this retrofuturistic setting, it's a bit unusual for a games today.Also love the plot format - this game tells you a story without literally telling anything."
414,2446,Blendo's best game and that's  saying something.
415,2446,"A very fun and intuitive game that's over way too soon. I really enjoyed the mechanics and gadgets that the game uses and figuring otu the solution to a puzzle iis extremely satisfying.However, the game as a whole suffers from being way too short and lacking in content and desperately needed more levels, a challenge mode or even DLC or a level editing/sharing platform. There was never a point in the game where everything you learned was put to the test and it ends rather anti-climatically.I'd recommend this game if you have the money to spare but don't excpet anything grand."
416,2446,Pretty  good tho.Just sometimes I can't select my devices and have to restart the game. Bug or mistake?
417,2442,"Got it only just a couple hours ago, but already hooked.Fantastic game."
418,2442,"This game is great! I am a network engineer, and use command-line interface very frequently. This is a fresh idea, that brings simple scripting, planning, and patience to get you through each level. It has a great tutorial system that allows you to ease your way into the different gadgets you obtain. One point deducted for several bugs. 9/10"
419,2441,"It is a very entertaining puzzle game. While it is not a strict ""terminal game"" you do use a command line to enter text commands throughout the game. I really wish I could recommend it, but with the non-stop issues I've been having, I can't, in good faith, do it. My only complaints are with the bugs I have run into while playing it. After running it for a couple of hours, the game will spontaneously lock up. Sometimes when I load the game it will load into a 640x480 window and freeze. And sometimes when I play, I am not able to cycle back through the keyboard commands without it also adding a carriage return. (IE, if my last command was ""test"" I should be able to hit the up arrow to get the ""test"" command line to appear in my current field--however, while it does bring up the ""test"" command it effectively hits <ENTER> executing the command by itself). Most of the time I can just cycle through all of my previous commands with no issues, but once this started happening, I have not been able to stop it from happening. I have posted these issues in the support forum, but have not received a single response. I'm sure it will all be patched and working in a few months and by then I can revisit it and (hopefully) change my recommendation."
420,2440,Pure fun.
421,2439,"DISCLAIMER: This is a first impressions review, and NOT a full review, if you want a full review, then please read better reviews then mine Quadrilateral Cowboy is a game developed by Blendo Games. A romantic look into 90's tech and the glamor of hacking; the game is about learning skills to pull off a good heist. You get equipment in game that allows you to accomplish new and different things, furthering your ability to get creative and solve puzzles in mutliple waysMost of these new abilities manifest as commands issued through your deck, which is a little hacking computer that you set up somewhere within each scenario to connect into framework technology that controls things like grates, doors, vents, and other accesible spacesBlendo Games have a knack for storytelling and scene creation that is dazzling and clever. This game made me feel like kind of a badass on the technical front. Story wise, I found it to be emotionally impactful and rewarding!Quadrilateral Cowboy is the newest and most enjoyable Blendo Games' game I've played so far! RECOMMENDED :)"
422,2439,love it!

424,2439,"It started out pretty cool with a nice atmosphere and fun first mission. Every chapter is basically an introduction to one new mechanic. But unfortunately the missions are pretty much based solely on that single mechanic. They don't build on top one another until the very last mission, which came way too quickly.There's also a couple chapters in the middle of the game where you don't even use your computer at all. That's the main draw to the game and then they completely get rid of it!Overall I would not recommend it, not at its current price point (I paid 22CAD)."
425,2439,this is NOT a hacking gamethis is a rob a bank with a computer simulatorwait scratch thatits a rob a bank simulator simulator becuase you character isn even physically at the place she commiting a crime! in game you go to a vr headset in game!For those of you looking for a hacker game like hacknet or uplinkturn back now
426,2439,love the game but tbh it is far to short :( i really hope this game gets a dlc with more maps and puzzels
427,2438,"Man oh man I love this game.  It is definitely not for everyone, but for some of you this will be the most satisfying game you will play.  The artwork is fantastic; zaney, techy and surreal, very reminiscent of  Jazzpunk , a style that I'm pretty crazy for.  On top of that, there's some mild in-game programming.  It's a simplified command line (MS-DOS) and doesn't require any coding experience, but if you do have some previous exposure you may have fun writing some recursive batch files, at your own risk that is :)Only draw back to this fantastic game is that it's a bit short (i.e. it's exactly like Jazzpunk).  My play through was a little shy of 8 hours, though I think for others it may be a little shorter as I like to really take in the scenery and perfect my solutions to games like this.  TL;DR - This game is a work of art, and like all art some people will appreciate it more than others.  For some it will be the best game ever, while others may hate it.  My advice? Give it a shot!"
428,2438,"This game is pretty good. (Really thats all I can say.) Though a little short for the price. I'm pretty sure that there are going to be more future updates, and there is a workshop. If they impliment a map making system into the game I can really see the workshop taking off."
429,2438,"By far the most original game I have ever played. If you want a breath of fresh air, look no further. I may be overreacting a bit, it has its flaws (not very long) but something about the game's fantastic atmosphere, story, and creative gadget-based puzzles just makes me want to praise it as much as possible. Please enjoy this wondeful game & support its developers, because if this is a good example of what they will do in the future, the Steam store is going to get a lot more creative."
430,2438,"Short game of maybe a few hours, but a lot of fun. Good puzzles that really made you think, but not overly convoluted. Graphics are obviously not the draw. The game for me was a mix between Portal and a hacking sim."
431,2438,"Fantastic game, probably my favourite gaming experience of 2016.However, I can definitely understand the criticisms. It really does feel like each new awesome gadget is not really used in its fullest, with only about one level featuring each one. However, this can only change when the workshop becomes more popular. Even with these problems, I can fully reccomend this."
432,2437,"Cool concept, unbelievably and unfairly shortAt the exact moment you think ""wow this game is getting pretty cool"" it's already over"
433,2436,Use your electric magic box to become the wizard described by Clarke's Third Law
434,2436,Okay so i have played this game and I love it but one thing I feel like it needs is more building things like the first mission where you had to get a processor or whatever and i thought that was very cool. Thats just my opinion :)
435,2436,I even shed a tear in the end.
436,2436,"Can't recommend this due to a lot of bugs.  It started out as fun, but later bugs make the levels unfinishable.  Later levels require a lot of time and patience, and nothing is more frustrating then almost getting to the end, only to have your character suddenly die of O2 deprivation while you're INSIDE the space station.  Another bug prevents you from seeing the output from the deck, which also required me to start over.  Another bug has your little robot (Weever) suddenly just disappear.  The game is a lot of fun, and as a developer I love the command-line mechanics, too bad it's just plagued by a bunch of game breaking bugs."
437,2436,"This game is something else.First of all: If you played Gravity Bone and/or Thirty Flights of Loving, this is a little different. The style is similar, however this game focuses a lot more on puzzles than a strange story experience. There are some strange and funny moments in the game, but they are not in focus as they were in previous games.The hacking mechanic is really fun, however, as the game progresses, it is used less in favor of other puzzle elements (jumping puzzles, controlling multiple characters, etc.), which are still fun, but i thought it would be good to mention.Some slight spoilers: The game ends in a rather abrupt way. It's just Last Job -> Done -> Credits. Again, if you played the previous games, you might end up a little dissapointed.Overall, i would give the game a 7/10, just for trying something new with the hacking mechanic.Story of Gravity Bone + Gameplay of Quadrilateral Cowboy = Dream Combohttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-L-jCr18g"
438,2435,"I can praise this game all I want, but ultimately your enjoyment of QC will depend on how much you like coding. At times the game's systems require tedious fiddling but overall I would recommend it in a heartbeat."
439,2435,"This is one of the most fun and unique games I've played on Steam! It's an abstract puzzler with a really unique aesthetic and clever game mechanics that leave you feeling satisfied for figuring out and solving the puzzles.  It rewards exploration and observation; there are plenty of nice touches and cool details and references all over the game that I loved and really added to the surreal 1980s cyberpunk atmosphere.If I had to level a criticism at this game as it stands, I think some of the levels could do with a bit more depth - each level is quite short and perhaps the clever mechanics deserve to be explored further.  I think there is a good chance that mods and community levels will keep the game fresh after finishing the campaign.A great effort and I am very content having paid full price for what is a really fun and unique game."
440,2435,"As expected of a Chung game, there's a lot of silent storytelling and melancholy feelings. This game is one of the more interactive games and is possibly one of the best in making you feel very clever as a by-the-bootstraps infiltrator. If you want to get a taste of programming, this has a genuine feel to it which makes it all the more immersive. The mechanics are taught at a good pace, with no mechanic overstaying its welcome. It follows a good storytelling and gameplay flow of action and rest, you'll feel comfortable. The narrative is touching, and you'll experience it, as you're the one working hard."
441,2435,Holy moly! 1 hour in and this is amazing! It's incredibly adept at moving you through space and time and cutting out all the cruft of plot development and spatial navigation. And then you feel like a BOSS when you succeed at a mission. I went from 2+ minutes on the second mission to under 28 seconds. I am a hacking master.
442,2435,Great game! But I wish it was a bit longer.
443,2434,"This game is great - it introduces u to new ideas and machanics through the game - and the attention to detail is amazing.All it needs are more missions and hopefully with the added income chung gets, he'll make dlc's or updates (hopefully)."
444,2434,"I loved this game.  I love the art style, the story, the gameplay, the whimsicalness, the music, and being immersed in this world.  It can be said that it is a bit shallow and without any real conflict, but I enjoyed the world and figurioung out the puzzles.  The ending was beautiful and caused me to shed a tear seeing the character in the mirror but in the end put a smile on my face."
445,2434,"Another short and sweet extravaganza of smoke and mirrors by the notorious Brendon Chung. Notorious because this is another game that you shouldn't buy for the quantity/price ratio. (The Interactive Art Book is overpriced for the extra $9, but as a horribly rabid fanboy I consider it a tip for the funding of future projects in the Citizen Abel universe.)At release the game is $20 for 6-10 hours of content which most people should find outrageous, but I find that the experience never outstays its welcome.The hacking feature is a total lie, as it boils down to a fancy lever pulling mechanic. But the implementation of the decking interface is just so finely tuned to fit with the environments that I found the glorified command line typing to be extremely immersive.Art _quality in this game is amateurish but the art _direction is insanely brilliant. It's a joy to see how the sum of clunky blocks and hand-drawn doodles are combined into a scene that engages the imagination.A bunch of interesting gameplay ideas are introduced with clever focus, but I was disappointed that those same ideas were never combined together into a cohesive climax.Extras like the timed leaderboards and sticky notes left by friends are clever, but with the bugs plaguing global sync, it is hard to take such features seriously.If you want to feel like a hacker in some 90s techno-exploitation flick, Quadrilateral Cowboy absolutely nails the execution. It won't teach you any programming and it will likely be disappointing in some burning way, but the experience will certainly leave an impression."
446,2434,"Its a game . one of a kind, you wont find anything the exact same. it has a rather good story, though, it isint too iteresting. this game can be frustrating. but its fun. me,i would buy it right away, if you like stealth, coding, and a bit of physics , you will like this. if you liked the style of jazz punk you will enjoy this."
447,2434,"Quadrilateral Cowboy - The Setsuna Missions - With MaximumPower Quadrilateral Cowboy is a single-player adventure in a cyberpunk world. Set in a strange demention of the 1980s, Quadrilateral Cowboy has you joining a gang of thieves who use there compurer hacking skills. Your main tool is a hacking deck that can manipulate the electronics around you, leveraging a basic, easy to learn programming language. As the game progresses, you get access to other tools, including programmable robots and guns.THis is a puzzle game where you use your computer, the deck looks like an MS DOS prompt 256k computer, a visual that will make the most sense to people who grew up with computers in the 80s and 90s. By typing in string of ""code' protocol to access remote computers, you can mess with the doors and objects to progress toward your goal.

448,2434,"This piece of software here, my friends, is excellent and definitely worth of your time. Hacking buildings and controlling robots and guns remotely by a virtual computer is amazing. Also, the game is charming and I really dig the art style. Just go for it."
449,2433,absolutely delightful.review.write;
450,2433,"This is one of those games that defies simple classifications.It's mostly a ""heist simulation"" game, but it subtly interweaves the various characters' personalities into the game.You won't need to read into it to enjoy it, but you will if you want to understand why the characters are the way they are."
451,2433,Such a fun game. Just started speed running levels. Handsdown a game that is on my top 5 lists. I love the aesthetic and the reference to Ready Player One. Super awesome game.
452,2433,"A bit expensive for a 3-4h game. Really fun if you enjoy coding and puzzle games (a bit too easy maybe ?).So much more could have been done with all the tools they give you, but at least there is no redudancy."
453,2433,"Here is a list of ways I can describe this game, in relation to other games:Like Blendo Games' other offerings, but with more structureLike Portal, but with more planning and more complex puzzlesLike Digital: A Love Story, but hacking the real world instead of the GibsonIf the idea of keying up a batch script to disable an array of lasers in perfect sequence, or using a remote turret to hit a button through a grate in the ceiling, or catapulting yourself from building to building on blasts of air appeals to you, buy this game.  If the idea of carefully planning your escape, then executing it flawessly with a single command appeals to you, buy this game.If you read all this, and you still have no idea what's going on, buy it anyway, and see what you think.  If you don't like it, you can always return it."
454,2433,"15 for 4 hours of gameplay? It's a tough choice, it's a really fun game, there's a section in the middle where I feel the game loses itself a bit so let's say 3.5 hours of really fun and 30 minutes of what was still fun but not what I got the game for. I recommend it, if you are willing to put down a good amount of money for a short game, but the modding community seems strong already and it's got be intersted in mapping. Overall excellent game, maybe too short but the length has encouraged me to try mapping!"
455,2433,It's only 5 hours long so I'd recommend buying it in a sale but this game is really fun. The mechnaics only seem to get fleshed out towards the end which sucks but there's mod support so I have no doubt people will make more content.
456,2433,"This game really makes me feel like a hacker. Although the hacking might not be as deep as that might make you expect, but still it is all satisfying to do."
457,2432,"Blendo took a giant step in the right direction with this game. With some of Blendos previous games they could be considered ""non-games"" to some due to perceived lack of gameplay and more of a walking simulator with light platforming feel. But with Quadrilateral Cowboy there is much more of an emphasis on gameplay using items and hacking to complete puzzles.The puzzles are mostly basic and pretty easy until the final few which blend together most of the tools you have learned through the game. My biggest complaint with the game is that there wasn't a single puzzle that used everything you have learned and you entire arsenal in one giant climactic puzzle, instead you are left wondering what could have been which may be intentional seeing as the story is deliberately left that way too.Old fans of Blendo will not be surprised by the subdued storytelling, but for some it might be a turnoff. A lot is left to the player to piece together through intuition and studying the environment, which in my opinion is needed me in storytelling in gaming.Another complaint is the length but that is mostly because I wanted more of the game as I loved it so much. Workshop support should help that out with (as of publication of this review) free maps being uploaded by the developers and fan maps hopefully becoming a thing in the future.If you like puzzle games you owe it to yourself to play this."
458,2432,I wish I had more thumbs to give.Sometimes a truly inspired game just defies description.  First person hacking puzzler with walking-sim interludes?  It doesn't need to be put in a box.  It's a perfect one of whatever it is.
459,2432,"I don't usually write reviews, but when I do..."
460,2432,too short. love it
461,2432,"this game is hands down phenominal, once i finished it all i wanted was more i would deffinatly recomend. the best game i have played so far this year"
462,2432,Very good puzzler!
463,2432,"I have barely played through the thrid mission and I already love this game. The art style is unique and original, the soundtrack is mae up of classical music and some modern stuff as well. The graphics don't matter much, and gameplay is a bit addictive. I do have a few complaints: The Weevil is a little hard to use because of the extremely small CCTV size, somme mechanics are not explained to well and the beginning segment confusedd me a little. However I am absolutley sure   that there are guides out there. I sincerly hope this game comes out with new content or maybe even a little DLC. YOU DON'T WANT TO PASS THIS GAME UP!"
464,2432,"While it's a bit short, it's easily one of the most unique and interesting puzzle games and hacking games I've ever played. The style is bold and strange, but appealing at the same time, and the puzzles are all very well-designed, with most of them really making you feel like you're infiltrating some sort of high-security base just with your laptop and a few other little gadgets. With the added mod support, I'd say this game is easily worth the money."
465,2432,"While not the best executed, this games concept is truly intriguing. It is moddable, so I can't wait to see what the community does with it. The game feels almost tame, like theres a lot more that can be done but it shies away from it. Again I feel like the moddability is going to be responsible for most of this games longevity. I really do like it though, the feel it gives you can be sometimes described as magical, giving me a rush as if I really were hacking my way into a heavily guarded establishment.Quadrilateral Cowboy gets an 8/10"
466,2431,The game has fun videos and pictures but it just dosent live up to my personal standard. I found it unengaging and not worth the money. It also felt as if it were lacking and not very complete.
467,2431,"This is the kind of game where, if I'd paid <10$ for it, I'd be happy with it. Points for originality, certainly. However, I find this game lacking in actual playability. It's oddly paced, unengaging, and the puzzles are so linear that they don't really feel like you're being clever when you solve them. There are elements of gameplay that feel pointless, and a few times they warn you of consequences that don't actually occur.I feel like this game was oversold. If it had been a small release and not costing $20, I think it would feel like less of a cheat."
468,2431,"It's a really fun puzzle game but a puzzle game in the same way Portal is, meaning it uses the mechanics of puzzles to actually narrate a story and construct a tone. The puzzles aren't super extremely difficult nor have multiple ways to solve them but they really function more for world building and character development. For a story without any diologue it does rather good job doing that. Brendon Chung definitely has a way of constructing stakes just through presentation an editing alone.And the puzzles are actually satifying to solve. I'm sure if you were acustomed to using DOS, the learning curve of typing commands to run programs will not take some getting use to. For someone born in 1991, like myself, it has a certain novelty to it and it is fun to get the hang of it after trial and error and learning shortcuts. All I can say is that for myself the game did a good job of making me feel like an elite super hacker.It's a nice bittersweet experience, like most of Brendon Chung's work. Its really cool to see him expanding the scope and refining his style with this game."
469,2431,Uh has anyone encountered the problem when during the first satsuna job they press F4 and it quits the game? Cause that's been happening to me and apperently i can't continue
470,2431,This game used dir/telnet instead of ls/SSH 0/10Pros:Nice action&puzzle-solving game.Geek enough for meCons:Game is short. Story nearly doesn't exist
471,2431,"I completely love you, Blendo Games!You elevate gaming into high art. Please keep doing the work you have been doing, and especially if you continue to add to Quadrilateral Cowboy, an already excellent and complete game.Review: This game is full of cyberpunk ""jobs"" that you do with two other characters, in a fully stylized world. With the use of multiple gadgets and hacking, you can use an easy to learn programming language to utilize them to break into highly secured places. Its a bit of a challenge to program multiple tasks, but it is very open ended in how you can do your programming. About 2 missions were a bit of a pain, due to me trying to figure out how not to get stuck in laser grids, but they were doable, and most of the many missions are not so very hard to figure out. I recommend this game to anyone who wants to challenge themselves with a game that uses objects and coding together to complete objectives, and anyone that has enjoyed Blendo Games work before.THE LARGEST PRO: The game itself is strangely emotional, and beautiful. The gameplay is solid but the unfolding of the group, without dialogue, and how they live and work together is just first rate. Not many games replicate the narrative as well, with so much minimalism, as this game amazingly does. By the time it was over, I was suprised to be as emotionally invested as I was. Come for the fun H@x0rz, stay for the deep emotional bond that develops."
472,2431,"Quadrilateral Cowboy was an absolute joy. Heists, hacking and a heart-wrenching and beautiful finale. The only negative thing about this game is that it isn't longer."
473,2431,"This is a wonderfully fun marriage of a hacking game and a heist game.  The mechanics are clever, the puzzles fun, and the mission locations interesting.  There's a minimal story included that is told mostly through environment, and there are several well-done ""wow"" moments to be had.My only complaint is the duration of the game.  I don't mind short games if they tell the story they need to tell and then stop, but Quadrilateral Cowbow really cries out for more levels and more complex puzzles.  If there was additional content, this would be an easy recommendation.  As it stands, though, I think I can only recommend it to people who are really on-board with the concept.  It's very fun, and I loved it, but QC left me wanting more content."
474,2431,"Worth the price tag IMO. The game has a some great mechanics. The hacking, the timing and the constant stream of new tech makes the game feel fresh from start to finish. The only downside to the gameplay is that you never feel like you get to apply everythuing at your disposal and everything you have learnt in some sort of ""peak"" level. The story was ingaging for me in a sort of indulgde at your own leassuire kind of way. Howver good it was it though, like the mechanics it never gets meaningfullly fleshed out kind of like the second half of the game was ripped out. All in all I enjoyed it, I dont regret paying full price for it but I wish that more time was spent fleshing out the game to come to a meaningfull end."
475,2431,"Fun heist game with coding elements.  Short, but I liked it, 4 hours of game time including reading the dev commentary."
476,2431,"Fun mechanics, engaging story, and while low budget the visuals have a charm to them. Just wish there was more freedom in how you used your tools during missions. It became very linear in the later levels, a disappointment considering the array of different gadgets you carry. Would still highly recommend this game though, had a great time playing through it."
477,2431,"I love this game. The interactions are fun, the 'language' is easy to learn and understand, the gadgets are creative and useful. The levels are interesting and require thought.My only complaint - the only one - is that it'so so so so short. Very few missions, with even less involving all of the unlocked gear. I would give this game 10/10 if it had more levels, but at this point it's a solid 7.Well worth a play though, and interesting. Has some replay value, as you can try to beat your best times on each level and find better ways to do things.Happy coding!"
478,2431,"9/10Solid gameplay, style and concept. Needs more heists! :)"
479,2431,You press Q to blink.  This is the greatest game I've ever played.
480,2431,Very creative. Very different. Very Nerdy. 10/10.Very small team (mostly Brendon) so very pleased with the finished product and what a small team can do.Telnet is fun.Blink is fun.Aimbot is fun.Weever/Weevil is fun.Nothing is not fun.All the hits hit home.The only complaints people have is that there isn't more in the game.I guess we'll just have to learn to mod and make our own...Like the hackers we are...
481,2431,So far I am in LOVE with Quadrilateral Cowboy! The blocky design makes it bring back good nostalgia of Thirty Flights of Loving and Gravity Bone. Way to go Blendo Games!
482,2430,clever little heist-em-up. loveley motif. give it a try
483,2430,"Loved the game.As people have noted, it's not really a puzzle game like most others. Mechanics are introduced and discarded frequently.It is, however, a heist game. There's a decent amount of linear hand-holding, but unintended paths are generally not penalized, and sometimes finding the strange, unintended way is more fun than the straightorward route. It does seem modding is planned, but I don't see any real support at this time. If more levels can be generated by the community, I see this having a good chunk of staying power."
484,2430,"Blendo seems to be very good with the intersection of aesthetics and game mechanics. His games seem to be able to explore territories that the fully polished AAA titans cannot. Essentially the game is polished as an experience of sorts, rather than just a vanilla game with a typical finish over the top. This game combines the artistic appeals of the citizen abel series, but adds more interesting and in-depth game mechanics. Especially if you're intrested in game development and/or the 'artistic' sort of games, play this."
485,2430,"A really solid little heist/hacking game.  I love both genres, and am pretty frusterated at how few games exist in each category, but this game knocks it out of the park with both effortlessly.  Mix that with Blendo's really unique artstyle and absurdist (I think) humor and editing, and you've got a pretty damn good way to spend $20."
486,2430,"This is probably the most interesting games I've player in quite a while, both with it's unique aesthetic and unique gameplay mechanics.  The act of actually hacking in a terminal, in game, is incredibly satisfying and flexible as a puzzle mechanics.  I found myself wanting to create the fastest way of navigating through the levels, and seeing doors magically open for you after you perfectly timed your hack really cements the theme of being an ace hacker.  The story is also excellent, told without much text and no voice acting, but still gives you a great sense of character and development.The only thing dissapointing about this game is that there isn't more of it.  It seemed like the puzzles and levels could be expanded and iterated on to do some really cool things.  Fortunately there's good mod support, so I look forward to seeing what the community creates and I'll probably give it a shot myself.  Overall, one of the coolest game experiences for me in recent memory."
487,2430,"At the time of this review being finished, I have completed the game. It's a very good game, it appears very daunting at first, but it's very easy to learn and become proficient at. My main complaint about this game is it's lentgh, it is very short as it only took me 2.5 hours to complete. Howver I believe as mods start coming out a lot of play time will be added, there's a lot of replayability as the leaderboard serves as a good metric to measure how good you are versus your friends and compared to the world wide standard, and the game runs very well. I definately recommend buying this game, or at least taking a look at it on youtube before you dive in."
488,2430,"I loved this game. There's so much story and creativity in the environment, you really should take your time and learn and find everything you can,"
489,2430,"Wes Anderson meets Neuromancer in a story-puzzle game I wish never ended. I hope the community supports this game and makes more levels. As is, the game is short (took me about 8 hours to enjoy my first playthrough, and I was stopping to smell the roses). But what a ride. Jack into your Bienjensu Heist Simulator and stick it to the man. Those suits will never know what hit'em.Chung has left the community with an excellent toolbox to build on his established gritty cyberpunk world. I hope some level designers out there take the ball and run with it."
490,2430,"1 hour and 25 minutes in and from what i have seen so far, this game is amazing!Do you like hacking?Do you like puzzles?Do you like comedy? (of course you like comedy...)This game is for you!I would give this 9/10"
491,2430,Very stylish game bit short
492,2430,"Let me start off by saying I loved this games concept and the the puzzle like design. I had been looking forward to this game being released since hearing about it a while back.All that said, I beat the game in 4 hours leaving much to be desired after finally getting used to all the different tools that are provided. I can only hope they aren't done designing more content because there is so much room for expansion. Admittedly for the price I was disappointed that I could beat the whole game so quickly.Few ideas for the developers:- Create levels that require the use of unique bullet types (rubber, tranquilizer, etc.) with limited quantity of each- Create different guns in different case sizes (pistol miniture case, machine gun or cannon luggage sized bag)- world wide score board not just people on computer- ability to multi-player beat levels (take on one of the roles)- another muti-player idea, create teams and both try to break into same building and steal same end prize. Whoever gets it first wins <x> points. Best of 3 maps- In outerspace you have everything in lowgravity except the player. Maybe add an element of gravity to the player too"
493,2430,"After finishing Quadrilateral Cowboy I can firmly say that it is great! Although the actual play time was pretty short the pacing made it feel much longer than it really was.As with Blendo's previous games this one is just brimming with charisma and charm; there are lots of tiny nods to previous works and movies that influenced the game.I couldn't help noticing that the game felt really influenced by the anime Cowboy Bebop (and I'm not just saying this cause of my name); Chung had previously said in an interview that the little red bullet boxes that appear in some of his games were taken from the show and it seems like quite a few more references and themes were taken from it. They both have a small band of misfits taking odd jobs and casually going to space. There is also the same mix of cultures in the enviroments that Bebop is full of; and they both have Cowboy in the title!Spoilers from here!The ending felt like it touched on a lot of the key themes from that show. It ends with you reminissing on the life of crime that you lived when younger; it seems like a happy ending but if you look carefully just before the final photgraph that triggers the end credits there are books on hospice care, and because you're the only person in the ending sequence it heavily implies that your partners in crime are probably now very ill or already dead; suggesting that all that fun that was had was only part of the past; in fact it kind of recontextualizes the entire game to from the perspective of older you looking back. In fact the leaderboards urging for a faster time after each heist suggest that you are looking back at the heists you completed during you life and thinking about how much better they could have been run. The reason I think this theme of recognizing that all of that was back in the past is also inspired by Bebop is because that is literally the key themes of Bebop; every character in that show has something from their past that they are either too focused on or trying to run away from.So maybe I'm just crazy and maybe obsessed with an anime, but considering Chung has mentioned that show as an inspiration to earlier works I think it is interesting to look into similarities."
494,2430,"This one is a doozy. How do you talk about a game you had a ton of fun playing, but feltcompletely underwhelmed by it?I guess the best way to start is with the stuff that it does well, and it indeed does it incredibly well.So whats the game about? You are part of a 3 man(woman)  crew who takes jobs and contracts of the illegal sort. You are a thief so to speak. A highly efficient thief. Not the kind that hides in the shadows and kills stealthly or parkours around the rooftops, but the kind that hacks security defenses, opens tightly locked doors, and deactivates lasers. Yes, you are a hacker.But where the games excels in this department over other similar premises, like Watchdogs, is in the way that it makes you feel like a hacker.Your biggest asset in this game is the laptop you carry with you and the way the gameplay around it works.You see, you have to manually place the laptop on surfaces and type in the command lines yourself, for example, opening a door will require you to type in door2.open(x), x being the number of seconds it will be open.This might sound tedious and annoying, but I assure it goes a long way to make you feel like a pro doing heists in the fastest time possible. Typing a long line of commands, and seeing the world unfold the way you want it to and reaching your goal perfectly is a great feeling.You then will get new gadgets with each subsequent new heist, stuff like a remote bot you have to connect to a small crtv  and type in the inputs you want it to do, or a turret that you have to pitch and move on your laptop.These are all fun gadgets that give promises and foretellings of how complicated the heists will turn out in the future, with the simple idea of having to manage them all at once being a sign of things to come.And this is where my biggest problem lies with this game. It never comes. Those hard puzzles where you have to take everything you learned so far to task and being able to manage every single gadget so you can get the objective and flee undetected do not exist in this game.Every heist gives you a new idea and mechanic, only for it to be abandoned in the next heist. There is even one point where the game gives you a heist where you need to control all 3 characters simultaniously to achieve the objective, which is great, only to abandon that idea the next heist, by giving every single ability to one character.The only heist where I can say your skills and understanding of the game are truly tested is the phenomenal last level, where you will constantly realize your mistakes and have to restart the level once again to do it just right, and it feels amazing. And then the game ends.My comprehension of how game development works isnt the best, and I understand that this is a one man project. But I expected more from this title, knowing how long it took to be made. There is a Mod section in the menu of the game, and while it makes perfect sense for it to exist, since this seems the kind of puzzle game that put in the hands of talented players could create amazing and incredibly complex levels, looking back at it now that I have finished the game, it just screams ""Lazy"" to me. You need to earn those talented players first, before you ask them to make levels for you.Its odd, because I absolutely love Portal, a game whose puzzles are very easy and the whole game feels like a tutorial, same as this one. Maybe its because Portal carries itself with its pacing and sense of world, and the amazing character of Glados.Which isnt to say that Quadrilateral Cowboy fails in this department. It has such style and aestethic, the kind I absolutely love, and it conveys so much about its characters with just a few short scenes and moments.But unfortunately, it wasnt enough for me. The price it asks is too much, buy this on sale.It feels like the game is struggling between being a narrative experience and a substancial videogame, and while the former is very good, the latter is definitely missing.If you value style over substance, then you might enjoy this very short and sweet experience, because the time I spent with it was very enjoyable. But if like me, you expect a slow increase in difficulty and the game demanding more of a player's skills as it goes along, you will not find it here.Its almost as if the dev of the game is simply giving you the tools to create a better game, and giving you a tutorial for things to come. If those things do come, I will gladly come back and enter this world once again. But if not, what we have for now feels unfinished.Im having Superhot flashbacks all over again. That was a game that also had a great premise, ended very fast, and had an absurd price tag. But at least Superhot had an Endless Mode where you could spend hours in if it was your kind of stuff.Sadly you wont find that kind of extra content here, unless you get into beating the levels again as fast as possible. Thing is, the levels are so easy, there really isnt much space to improve on your score..."
495,2430,the absolute coolest
496,2430,Absolutly wounderful.  One of the best games I have played in some time.  If I had a complant that would only be that I wish there was more I finished the entire game in about 6 hours and that was with no alarms and under the global average on all levels.The only other thing It feel like once you learn a new piece of gear and use all the command line stuff to the point where you are really good at it it seems like it gets tossed away at about the mide point and you hardly us it.  Would have loved to see more puzzles with more of that stuff the last half of the game has a smash and grab feel even without raising alrams.TLDR: PLAY THIS GAME ITS GREAT!!!!!
497,2430,"A very artistic game that also has engaging gameplay.I found both the setting and narrative to be very interesting. Some may not find much in the vagueness and lack of explicit exposition, but I quite enjoyed exploring the world and trying to discover what it was about. The world is very clearly different from our own, but it shares enough similarities that it's not completely alien which makes it quite a bit eerie and mysterious.The artstyle is very distinctive; lots of low-polygon shapes and flat colors makes it more of a symbolic rather than realistic style. I feel this symbolic artstyle combines very well with the strange world because the familiar symbols and the unfamiliar setting create an interesting and somewhat unsettling contrast. The textures are also very high quality, even insignificant pieces of paper are readable. Some text is so small that even walking right up to it you can't really read it, you have to zoom in even further for the text to become large enough. This high texture quality makes the world feel very crisp and made exploring it more enjoyable.The gameplay was also good, but it is somewhat lacking in depth. The puzzles were not so hard that they became frustrating, but not too easy either and it felt rewarding to solve the harder missions. I feel like the missions were all well designed in the way they introduced new mechanics and ramped up the difficulty. Some have said the puzzles have a programming element, but that's not really true. There's no conditional logic and very little abstraction, you type commands into a command line and that's it. The lack of depth doesn't show up in the missions themselves, it only become apparent in the game's length. The game can be pretty short if you're decent at puzzle solving and don't take the time to look around you but go straight for the objectives.It took me about 4 hours to finish the game, and I spent a good portion of that time doing other stuff than just solving the puzzles. The length doesn't bother me, I had a great time playing the game and I will probably go back to it to try to improve my time on different missions or try different approaches.I should note that you have the ability to skip every mission if you want to, which I think is a nice feature in case you get stuck on something. There's little narrative exposition in the missions themselves, and you have the ability to explore every world in noclip mode so there's really no penalty to skipping other than missing out on the puzzle itself.All in all I think this is a great game. If you like puzzle games this is good. If you like exploring weird settings with unique art this is good. If you only care exclusively about gameplay and solving hard puzzles the game might too short."
498,2430,"https://youtu.be/jqP2m6Z4whwSometimes you just want to sit in from of a pc while sitting in front of your PC. If you're an idiot like me, I'd bargain this is the game for you. Blendo is back with their masterful pacing and obtuse storytelling, and even now comes with a video game packed inside.Inventive and creative, Quadrilateral Cowboy is a very good game. No single mechanic is ever exhausted and QC captures a feeling in a way most games can't. You'll walk away from Quadrilateral Cowboy feeling like a true hacker, even if all security systems in this universe are extremely rudimentary. A few twists and turns here and there keep things fresh and make QC a must-play for fans of indie games. Not without its flaws though, there are definitely plenty of engine issues with Quadrilateral Cowboy. I found myself clipping through environments, stuck in walls, and dealing with sloppy transitions regularly. An overall clunky interface can also be a bear on the experience. Luckily its flaws don't hold it back too much and there's plenty here to like."
499,2430,"Just simply amazing, love the concept, the style and the music. Pitch perfect!"
500,2430,"It's cheap, it's short, it's a bit buggy at times but it's one hell of a good time. Seriously, I love this game from the bottom of my heart. Complete recommendation from me!"
501,2430,Neat game with some neat puzzles and interesting mechanics. Made even better if you have even a little interest in or knowledge of programming. Won't say much else without giving things away. Another great game from Blendo.Will update once I've finished it.
502,2430,"Great game mechanics, great visual style, great everything really.  Never played a game quite like it.  I just wish there were more levels maybe with more than one or two solutions.  Can't wait to see what people come up with in the Workshop."
503,2430,"It introduces tons of fun elements that are a blast to explore and master and once you master them, the game ends and it leaves you wanting tons more. Although I'm glad that I even got to play the game. It's full of charm and style and it's completely worth it. It was quite refreshing to just have a condenced fun time instead of a long game with fun sprinkled throughout. If I was going to die in 5 hours and I had to choose what game I would like to experience over again, this would be the game."
504,2430,Great game I admit its a shame its short however a very unique style and gameplay jope they relise new levels
505,2430,"As you'd expect from Brendon Chung's previous games, Quadrilateral Cowboy is set in a beautiful colourful world with lots of small details and environmental storytelling to discover. The hacking systems have a great tactile feeling to them, though the puzzles don't get particularly complex."
506,2430,"The only bad thing about this game is that theres not more of it. You can try to get good times and mess around a bit, but besides that, not much else to do. Short campaing with really awesome puzzle mechanics that could've been used more often make this something nice to spend your weekend or afternoon with, giving you can afford its price, but thats it. Can't wait for the modding community to hit this game thoe, hopefully they wil l be able to do what the developers could not, make amazing, challenging levels that utilize all the fascinating mechanics the game has to offer."
507,2430,"I'm a big fan of Blendo's games and this one is no exception.The hacking mechanics work well. It has a quirky comic book vibe coupled with a lot of weird and wonderful set-design. And story is generally lovely: a minimal tale about three wistful, nerdy friends just hanging out and hacking. If you're big into Wes Anderson movies then I'm sure you'll really dig it. I eagerly await whatever Brendon Chung comes up with next."
508,2430,"This is a very fun game even if its a bit short, I look forward to more mods being available as I think this game has wonderful modding potential. It is worth the price if you are into cyberpunk/hacking games, although I would keep in mind this game is very different than what you are probably use to from that genre. The best comparison I can make is to the game else.heart(break) but the scripting in this game is more simple and limited.All around I would give it a 9/10."
509,2430,"Quadrilateral Cowboy is an aesthetically pleasing addition to the cyberpunk genre. It poses interesting hacking-based puzzle levels interposed by intriguing and charming vignettes in a domestic and oddly comforting atmostphere. A great, short experience balancing narrative with byte-size hacking-based puzzles."
510,2430,"This game is extremely fun; however, for the amount of money for the game and amount of levels, it is not worth buying. I did have fun playing it, but I was expecting the game to be longer than 4 hours. Also, the devs spent a lot of their time in the story mechanic other than the level design. Most of the levels are simple, but I like the more complex ones towards the end which make you restart over and over. My face was blank when I realized the game was over. Hopefully there will be a workshop where players can design their own levels(if there is one then I didn't check and I'm too lazy to check). If you happen to have 20$ in your steam wallet and love cliff hangers l, this is the game for you."
511,2430,"Seriusly want more, this is a great game and has amazing gameplay, but some bugs where you can fall thru walls and off the map"
512,2430,Absolute gold.The simplistic graphics are dripping with style and intentionally focus gameplay on the puzzles and hacking mechanics which are paced flawlessly. Not like anything i have played before.
513,2430,"First Impressions Video:https://youtu.be/5gH1Zss1t90Quadrilateral Cowboys is a crazy ride. It's not without its flaws, but it's a great time.Basically, QC (because that name is WAY too long) is about being freelance ""hackers"" who steal stuff. Most of the game is an interplay between the real world around you and console commands that you type into your deck (in game computer). The game is set in a strange cyber punk 80's setting. A probably dystopian society and more weirdness around every corner makes the world enjoyable to be in.Now, the gameplay. This sits in a weird space for me. I really like it. The concepts behind it are great and the execution is enjoyable, but the levels never allow the depth that one would expect from a puzzle game. Every level brings in a new ability and each of those levels is focused on that thing. In other words, every level asks you ""do you know how to use this ability?"" but no level ever delves into the interplay between the abilities. I was always expecting to find a big level with complex puzzles necessitating the use of all of the skills I'd learned so far, but that level never came. Plus, the puzzles aren't that difficult. Most of the time I could easily see what needed to done, and succeeding was just a matter of things out.But it's not al bad, because I've enjoyed the experience. The game was definitely fun, just not as fun as it could have been.In the end, QC is unique and definitely worth the time, but it never manages to mature into a serious puzzle game. Is it worth picking up? At $20, I would say that if you really want to check it out, you can pick it up. If you're only interested in it, wait until it's on sale for around $10, because it's definitely worth that price."
514,2430,"Love the environment, and the mish-mash of the setting. The story was presented more in a ""find the lore"" approach rather than being cutscene driven (anyone notice those books on hospice care?), each heist level alternates with a shopping or downtime level that you can either explore or just speed through depending on your interest in that.  There was also some care clearly put into making the world very interactive, though this typically amounts to just picking the item up and moving it around. The sticky-note system lets you leave tips & messages for your friends to see whenever they play through a level, akin to the Talos Principle's graffiti except you can actually type whatever you like on the note.  The notes are also small enough in size that someone worried about potential spoilers can avoid zooming in to look at them.The gameplay itself has all the right tools for a stand-out puzzle game, though most of the levels are largely ""I know I'm supposed to use this device, lets watch for where I use it"".  By the time you're given all the tools at once and aren't being especially corraled, the game is over.  I ended up with 6.2 hours, and I spent some extra time on certain levels playing around with how smoothly & automated I could make things...building long batch files while in the ""Casing"" mode so I could sail through the non-casing mode with good timing and a few blink commands rather than frequently accessing the deck.  If you have several friends who play it, you may get some extra playtime by trying to beat your friend's fastest times on the various heists...at the time I played it, none of my friends had given it a go.I highly recommend playing it if the concept sounds up your alley, but I'd wait for it to go on sale, or wait for the Workshop to add new levels or the like (I'm posting this review just a few days since release, so take that into consideration relative to whenever you're reading this review. New maps are created using Dark Radiant, see here )."
515,2430,"EDIT: The creator has announced free levels coming soon, time will tell if they will be worth it!Short and sweet, but with an amazing mechanic that ultimately leaves the player EXTREMELY dissapointed.This game has probably my favorite game mechanic, ever. Its magical and very customizable, which COULD lead to insanely creative ways to solve the games many levels. Which leads us to the problem: there aren't that many levels, and it feels like the levels were created with only one or two solutions in mind. The levels are so simple, and segmented, so it doesn't feel like there is much synergy. You can't really chain things together outside the moments, you can tell, that you were explicitly supposed to; except for a few occations (and in my opinion are the best moments of the game, really, pure joy) here and there.It's like all the effort went into the story and the mechanic, and none into level design. Which is insanely dissapointing, because it would be the best game I've ever played if a little more polish was put into it. My number one example for this, is the two person heist mechanic, where you have two characters who you can sync up with your watches, planning each move carefully, but then its over. Boom, 2 or 3 levels and we never see it again. Essentially the tutorial to use this mechanic is the duration you get to enjoy the mechanic.  Really though, thats how the whole game feels, by the time you have really gotten to use the equipment well, you are done and wont play the game again.You can tell a lot of love was put into this game, and you can see from my playtime I have loved this game, but it leaves so much to be desired. Most of my time was spent seeing if I could unlock ""the rest of the game"", praying it was hidden.If the dev ever announces that they are going to hire a level designer to make a second story, or just a puzzle mode where you play several levels during the at least 25 year gap between the beginning and end, I will recommend the game. For now I don't want to let people get as let down as I was, even if the first 4 hours were amazingly fun."
516,2430,The first couple missions are a little simple but the game progressively gets quite entertaining. Poking around on the deck seems ot have paid off sofar.
517,2430,"Really enjoyed this game. Incredibly charming, with fun tools that continually expand the possibility space. The environments that the ""heists"" take place in are imaginative and clever. My only significant complaints are that I wish the whole toolset had been used in more missions once you have access to it, and I wish there had been more  multi team member missions. That said, better to end strong than overstay your welcome.Since the game has built in mod support, there is reason to hope that the community might take that ball and run with it. Regardless, I think it was well worth the money, just make sure you are ok with a reasonably significant amount of typing!"
518,2430,"Wonderful if not a bit short (finished in just under 6 hrs).  Great blending of the command-line / hacking genre wrapped in a first person puzzle game, and the whole thing is dripping with artistic style very reminiscent of that in Jazzpunk.  Can't wait to see what the community cooks up in the workshop.  Will definately be checking back for updates and player designed heists!"
519,2430,"This game was a hell of a lot of fun and I'd recommend it to anyone who likes puzzle games. It's a little on the shorter side, but the puzzles are all very creative."
520,2430,THEY ADDED ORANGES BUT YOU DON'T EVEN PEEL AND EAT THEM LIKE IN 30 FLIGHTS OF LOVING
521,2430,This is one of the most cyberpunk games I have ever played. It's a little bit buggy but nothing game breaking. Overall this is a great game.
522,2430,"This game is not for everybody. With that said, its definitly for me.You will get many diffirent tools and visit quite a few cool locations. all this combined makes for some great puzzels.There is also definitly a story but i honestly can't tell you much as im not yet to far into it.My conclusion is that i can definitly recommend this.if this is for you its worth every penny at full price!"
523,2430,This game was like masturbating. May seem frustrating at first but when you finish you feel great.
524,2430,"Unparallelled worldbuilding, unparallelled puzzle design, unparallelled amounts of polish in places where you really wouldn't expect there to be polish. The puzzles unfold in that beautiful way that's always only the tiniest step ahead of you, tickling your cranium. The pretty sights and sounds you're seeing are surprising and unique, which is good, but when you're solving these puzzles you have moments when you realize you just thought of something exciting and unique, which is truly marvelous.Downsides: There are a few bugs and stability issues (though the game autosaves often enough it was never very frustrating). It's something to note, and it's disappointing, but it's not a deal-breaker. And, yes, like everyone else, I wish it were fifty hours long. Oh, well. It's certainly worth the twenty bucks - you can easily see the love and devotion that Brendon Chung put into every tiny detail over the long years this game was in development."
525,2430,"While I don't want to diminish Brendon Chung's own artistic style, I find that the simplest way to describe Quadrilateral Cowboy is to say that it is cyberpunk with a heavy Wes Anderson flavor. Modernist visuals are skillfully blended with the attitudes of cyberpunk to make a universe that is truly fun to play in and examine.You play as one of the members of a three-woman tech contractor firm which specializes in performing high-tech theft. You use a variety of black-market cyber tools to solve puzzles in order to steal whatever you've been paid to. During the breaks between jobs you have the opportunity to learn more about the personalities and histories of the other characters, adding an emotional dimension to the game without using dialogue.Chung has also made an introductory guide for making mod levels for QC to accompany the game and it seems he is planning to update it further to answer questions people are having, which I really appreciate.My main complaint is that it feels far too short. I really kept wanting to be able to see more of QC's world after it ended. But overall I truly enjoyed playing it. The high point of the game, for me, was being tasked with making digital copies of the brains of coma patients in a clinic floating in space."
526,2430,"The game looks and sounds amazing but its stays pretty basic beyond the initial puzzles.It's also quite short and buggy (this might have been fixed in later patches). I really wanted this game to be great after following the development pretty closely. However, the end product just doesn't resonate with me, despite liking previous Blendo Games such as Gravity Bone."
527,2430,"All of the flavor of 30 Flights and Gravity Bone mixed with an extremely clever puzzle game. Plays a lot like any of the ""programmer"" puzzlers out there, but strikes a fantastic balance. It's approachable enough that someone who has never touched programming still won't have any trouble understanding exactly how to solve the puzzles, but it has enough depth to allow a lot of automation if you want to reach for the top of the leaderboards.The only downsides for me were the length (it's really short, but it might have some replay value if you want to speedrun, and it's open to modding so hopefully some community level packs will emerge) and some of the midgame levels are ""meh"" ( personally, I thought the  levels where you control multiple characters  were extremely boring and linear).The pricepoint is a little high for the length of the game, but you won't find anything else quite like it."
528,2430,"I usually never write reviews (I know, it's a cliche) but I had to write one for this game, is very fun, especially if you love cladenstine/hacking type things, if you played Hacknet (which if you like hacking games it is a must, super fun and mostly realistic) it is like that, but you move around and aren't just using a terminal remotely, you go fromplace to place using your terminal on the fly and after each location (each location has 3 jobs in it) you get new gear to help you along) the story so far is fairly good (I am not far so I cannot say much about the story) the game is very ""figure it out, do it however you want, there are no guidelines"" style, which works phenomenally. I could go on all day about this game, if you love hacking/secret spy type breaking in and not being detected/not setting off alarms while using state-of-the-art equiptment, this game couldn't be better. Keep in mind that this game is not like TIS-100, you are not re-programming the game or coming up with complex solutions, you are using ingenuity and simplicity to solve the puzzles (like a real hacker does (I personally am a Penetration tester/white hat hacker)) I love this game for that, I have been waiting on a long, fun, accurate hacking game since I played and re-played Hacknet; this game, is that game.TLDR: If you enjoy simplicity over complexity (Portal because it didn't have 20 portals), inginuity over complexity, and hacking/cladenstine type operations, than this game is for you."
529,2430,"Quad Cow stands with with Portal, Talos Principle, and The WItness as one of the great first person puzzle games. I really hope the modding scene takes off!"
530,2430,"Loved it. Great gameplay, great art style, great story."
531,2430,"I have since changed my review from negative to positive - despite a few crashes, it wasn't enough to warrant a negative review. This is a solid, albeit short game - one that stands on it's own merits. I feel the press had paid a little too much attention to the mechanics of the game, which overshadowed the fact that it's a fun puzzle game, with some pretty interesting puzzles / detours. The game wasn't what I expected; that's hardly a fault or a bad thing though. I rather enjoyed it once I let it just be what it was.A lot of people have commented on it's length - there's enough there to last 5 - 12 hours depending on play style, plus there's the Steam Workshop.I would recommend this game to people who liked Portal and English Country Tune - there's enough variety in the mechanics to keep you interested. A fine game indeed."
532,2430,"If you've ever seen the movie Hackers, that's the vibe of this game. You are a hacker in a cyberpunk setting who uses various techniques and tools to perform heists in various settings. The puzzles feel just right and the introduction of new tools over time are done at just the right time. After each heist plan it reveals a little bit more of the story and the world in general without a single word of dialogue. The overall execution is very well done."
533,2430,after a long day at work nothing is more cathartic than throwing a computer around the room
534,2430,incredible
535,2430,A legitimately good game that I highly recommend to people who like the following:- Typing commands gameplay.- A slightly bizarre world.- A simple start-to-finish story without dialog.- Manual Aimbot.- Depth in places where there usually isn't
536,2430,"I don't review games often, but this game is absolutely amazing.My expectations just keep getting blown away again and again."
537,2430,Put it this way: somewhere there's a parallel universe where Quadrilateral Cowboy is a truly extraordinary game sorely lacking a tutorial.
538,2430,"Clever and flavorful, you could describe Quadrilateral Cowboy as a longer, more 'gamey' 30 Flights of Loving.The puzzles and mechanics are quite unique, and are introduced at a good pace to keep those ""aha!"" moments coming. Save for a bad egg or two closer to the end, the puzzles also tend to flow very well. When it works, you easily feel like you're running your own one-man film heist with careful planning and precise execution which feels extremely satisfying. When it doesn't work, you're getting stuck in a wall or chasing a rare dead-end in one of the later levels.You'll spend a lot of time with a virtual command prompt while you plot and optimize your thieving shenanigans, but if you're cool with or even look forward to that this is a solid puzzle game with plenty of charm and wit packed neatly into an engaging plot and setting."
539,2430,Just finished it. Short and sweet.  Had a great time playing through.
540,2430,"I've watched and waited for a long time. Its everything I wanted it to be and more, Love it."
541,2430,"A fun game for geeks and anyone who wanted to be a theif while growing up. My only complaint is that it left me wanting to play more. (There is the possibility for mods adding in more story but there is nothing out yet.)The game has a jazzpunk feel and has a lot of optional elements, looking around is always a good idea as there are story elements everywhere.9/10""I want more levels to play on..."""
542,2430,Thank you
543,2430,Couldn't be happier - loved every second of it.
544,2430,execute function commands one heist at a time
545,2430,"I had a wonderful time hacking my way through the heist missions in Quadrilateral Cowboy. It is a game that challenge you to master some simple console commands and make it feel rewarding when used to solve the puzzles. As the story goes on you regularly obtain new equipment to play with as well. I was also a bit touched by the cool characters and their stories. Plus there is an awesome store owner, best since RE4. :)This goes right up there among my favorite games of 2016, right behind The Witness. A very strong PC-title.+ Fun ""programming-gameplay"" with challenges that feels rewarding to solve+ Not too long+ Lovely design and retro-feeling, both in terms of graphics and sound"
546,2430,"Good but short, very short."
547,2430,"I have been waiting for this release for many years, I watched the live streams and payed close attention to the development progress. Let me tell you this game was worth every moment of the wait! Buy it now! Can't wait to play more!"
548,2430,"Yes.Give them your money. You want to play this.It was only about 5 hours.. but if I could wipe my brain of that 5 hours, buy it again and replay it, I would in a heart beat.. a few times.. at least 4 times.. Maybe 5. Not 6.. that's just silly."
549,2430,"This is an excellent hand-crafted puzzle game with beautiful story moments and gorgeous details. Like the rest of the Blendo Games first person catalog, it never wastes your time -- every room of every level is about something, there's no ""filler"" here. Imagine the purity and confidence of Portal 1 (a puzzle game that gracefully knew when to stop) with the visual sensibilities of Hong Kong filmmaker Wong Kar-wai, and you get QuadCow.Many of the negative reviews here are going to complain about how the game doesn't escalate into a hugely over-complicated multi-part multi-agent mission that requires you to engineer 100s of lines of code with 20 different remote devices... but I think it was a wise decision to avoid this same trap that nearly every coding puzzle game falls into.This is not a programming game about complexity -- rather, it's about ingenuity. This is not about designing a giant system with 100 moving parts, and Portal would not have been a better game with 8 portals. Instead, this game is about using the right command at the right time at the right place. (If you know what you're doing, you can complete many of the levels in 30-60 seconds. But the first time you try, it'll take you 15-30 minutes.)Conceptually, QuadCow is about re-imagining the act of coding. Is coding a slow crawl of engineering, or can it be a light and delicate performance, like cold water or a kiss?If you want TIS-100, go play TIS-100. But in this game, YOU ARE A COWBOY, NOT AN ASSEMBLY PROGRAMMER. It's in the gosh-darn title, ok???(Disclosure: I alpha-tested this game and bought the game myself.)"
550,2430,"Quadrilateral Cowboy is a story about having those youthful, exciting, and often dangerous experiences with a really tight-knit group of friends as you journey through life together, and then growing old to reflect fondly on those memories. It is all very beautiful to experience.Half the game is a story that unfolds, and the other half is puzzle solving. The tale is quite moving, and the puzzles are very reasonably difficult, and quite rewarding. If you know Chungs work, you know what to expect as far as the experience or flavor. Otherwise, here is a test to gauge if you will like this game. If two of the three apply to you, then I highly recommend you buy it:1.	You have enjoyed other Blendo games, specifically Thirty Flights of Loving.2.	You enjoy hacking or logic puzzle games such as Duskers or to a lesser extent TIS-100.3.	You are a fan of Wes Anderson films, or follow any director (for that matter) that has a very potent flavor or style.I didnt mention the price tag, because it still remains to be seen how the Workshop and future updates will change the play content. Two days after release Chung added update 001 which added some cool things. Also to note, the cryptic three digits there. Will there be hundreds of small updates over time? Not sure. Mileage will vary, but if you enjoy the game, there is quite a bit to explore. It wont be difficult to get at least 10 hours out of what is here now. Right now, you can experience the storyline (~5 hours), replay with commentary (~2 hours), and then race the high scores or mess with mods (Im not sure what kind of hours this will add  likely depends on you).Essentially, you have a variety of technologies to accomplish hacking based tasks. The whole thing is played out in 1st person mode, where you solve puzzles by using computer code. The learning curve is nowhere near as steep as others in this genre. In fact, most found the puzzle difficulty underwhelming. I did too, but honestly, it was almost refreshing to be able to finish it without banging my head off the walls for days.While a common complaint is that Quadrilateral Cowboy is too short, I actually may *slightly* have the opposite feeling. Debatably, what made Thirty Flights of Loving so magical is how quick of an experience it was. It packed sooo much in, in so little time. Now, Quadrilateral Cowboy doesnt wear out its welcome, but I totally understand why the base game length is what it is. Pros:+Beautiful Blendo style that throws you into magically wonderful storytelling like no other game can+Awesome mix of first person and hacking or logic puzzles+The details are often in the simplicity of Chungs storytelling; the feelings can have so much impact with such minimal graphics/sound/tech+Unlike other games in this genre, this title can totally be finished by nearly anyone (instead of just those who have ample experience with logic code)+Updates are still being addedCons:-There are still a few bugs that are being ironed out-Some will see the price-to-hour ratio to be a negative; I still say lets wait and see, but overall Im more than happy (I would have spent more, but Im a huge Blendo fan)-The first half of the story and the end was definitely stronger than the later portion of the game; the portion where you enter team play and the bits in outer space were odd and Im still not sure how it all gels together story-wise-Some of the magic that made Thirty Flights of Loving was in its brevity; Quadrilateral Cowboy does not overstay its welcome, but makes me question how length of game plays a role with such potent storytellingThis was my most anticipated title of 2016. Do I think it is game of the year? Too soon to tell. It certainly lived up to my hype, which says something. If you are an avid indie game fan, this is a must-play. Nobody makes games like Blendo. Period."
551,2430,"This is overall a very beautiful game and a very unique experience. It's exactly what you would expect from playing Blendo's previous standalone 3D games Gravity Bone and Thirty Flights of Loving. It's longer and grander than both of those, but it shares many of their traits, such as Blendo's unique storytelling methods and his great worldbuilding, using techniques like magic realism and implied plot. The gameplay is more focused in this game than in his others (they didn't have much in terms of puzzles or things like that) and it adds to the game significantly. The hacking mechanics are very well done and it's very fun to use all the gadgets. The only flaws with this game are that the missions are linear puzzles without much replayability (actually not any replayability at all unless you feel like getting more immersed in the gorgeous world or want to go for a better time on the arbitrary leaderboards) and the many crashes experienced during play. Blendo is, however, working progressively and diligently to eliminate bugs and crashes so by time anyone reads this, the crashes will probably be fixed. Overall I feel it was worth the $20, but if you want a longer game (it's about 4 hours long), or expect sandboxey levels ala deus ex and an in-your-face story, then you probably won't enjoy it. This game can be summed up as 30 flights of loving multiplied by 10 with keyboard hacking ala command prompt and a couple neat gadgets (remote controlled robot, autoturret, springboard-type launcher) so if that doesn't sound appealing, don't buy it."
552,2430,Good game! i like it:)
553,2430,"I think this game has some great possibilities, but it seems a lot is still lacking. Game is buggier then a bethesda on a good day, but a lot of that can be overlooked (one man dev studio, is probably going to have many bugs), as of now there are tons of bugs.This is a puzzle game, very similiar to portal or talos principle, so if you enjoy those games, you will enjoy this. If you're a fan of Blendo games, you will get more of what you loved in the previous games he's released. If not, but you enjoy puzzle games, I would wait for a more polished released.Mods are probably what will make the game really fun, as it supports them and I can't wait for more people to get into it."
554,2430,"this game is way to easy, to short and overpriced. But i like the syntax idea but really hacking no."
555,2430,"Loved the game, could argue that it was too short but I'm satisfied with the rewarding gameplay and unique puzzle mechanics. Not much more to say.  Better to experience it first hand and find out for yourself what makes it so great!"
556,2430,"A fantastic experience, albeit a short one.  While the other reviewers are correct in that the game ends before it truly begins, the core mechanics are solid.  It is clear that the fine folks at Blendo have assembled a fantastic set of building blocks, they simply need to do some more building with them.  As I said, the mechanics are solid.  Using the deck to interact with both items in the level and subsequent tech feels fantastic.  The alarm timers are a nice solution to the problem of giving the user too much direct control - if a door or laser is opened for more than a (visibly posted) length of time, an alarm sounds.  This prevents the user from simply holding doors open indefinitely and lends itself also to some of the more interesting timing puzzles.In short, while I hope more content is forthcoming, I consider Quadrilateral Cowboy as it stands worthy of the price of admission."
557,2429,I've been following this game for a long time and it is everything I hoped it would be! Another awesome Blendo video game.
558,2429,"Upon finishing this game I can honestly say that this is the most refreshing puzzle game since Portal! Some may be turned off by the fact that this is a 5 hour game for 20 euros but you can tell a lot of love and dedication was poured into this project. By entering code into your laptop you hack doors and laser grids, control robots and gimbal turrets in order to steal classified information from a variety of places. For me this is the first game where it actually feels like you are hacking. Quadrilateral Cowboy even boasts a Dark Souls like message system where you can post post-it notes in the levels which your Steam friends can see. Highly recommended!"
559,2429,"Interesting gameplay elements, although not nearly enough levels to fully utilize the possible complexity.I suppose we have to wait and see if other users can satisfy this craving in the workshop. As it is now, many people might not find the price worth it for the amount of content."
560,2429,"This was hands down THE best game I have played this 2k16, and was possibly the best puzzle/adventure/hacking game I've ever played. If you had asked me a day or so ago what my favourite puzzle game was; I would tell you the portal series. Now, it would be Quadrilateral Cowboy. no question.The story was simplistic, yet beautiful and oddly touching. I felt myself grow attached to my group of friends,  though a single word was never spoken. The ""Hacking"" mechanics were easy to use, and even easier to learn. Unlike a majority of well known hacking games, you actually type commands, rather than 'click' them. Don't expect these commands to come in handy in real life, but in the context of the game it felt empowering and, well, awesome.  The gadgets were simply F***ing awesome, and some of the 'abilities' you pick up later on are pretty cool too. My only complaint was that the game ended feeling too short, even though in truth I had played for 7 hours. I suppose that is the hall mark of fun, though. Time flies when you're having it. The technology had a retro feel to it, which was, to put it simply, delicious. I've never had more fun typing on a clunky old keyboard, inserting cassette tapes, or hooking a telephone line to my laptop. If you haven't played this yet, do. You won't regret it."
561,2429,"beautifully visionary and super fun.Can't wait to be mapping for this. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=701335671Playing a bit slowly and investigating details, replaying some missions for a better time score, I finished the game in 6 hours.Very recommended, support this awesome dude and yourself and buy this."
562,2429,Great ending
563,2429,"This is a very cool and interesting puzzle game, but it crashes A LOT. Parts of the game requires set up, timing, and waiting, which really takes away from the experience (when it crashes right before pay off). Ultimately, it's cool game, but, in its current state, not worth $20."
564,2429,Very creative puzzle game.
565,2429,Bought this game almost on impulse and was not disappointed.It's beautifully executed (don't let the blockheads fool you) and solving the different puzzles is highly satisfying.Also excited to see a content update just two days after release... Oranges count as content.
566,2429,Something fresh and excitingInfiltration and hacking without leaving a trace in a puzzle environment. Quick in quick out. Plan your next move carefully :)
567,2429,Quadcow refuses to be tamed! It will ascend to the 14th palace of celestial omnipotence if it dang well pleases!!
568,2429,great game! too short
569,2429,"This game had the potential to be great, but never realizes that potential.I kept wondering when I would leave the tutorial and get to the actual game - and 4 hours later it was over.Quadrilateral Cowboy's biggest problem is that it refuses to combine its different puzzle types into a sum greater than its parts, choosing instead to keep them frustratingly discrete. Each map introduces a new puzzle type, usually along with a new item, which is then used as the main puzzle on that map. Then you'll move on to a new puzzle type - usually with enough hand-holding that you never really need to think about the solution. Solve a puzzle once and you've solved it forever: the puzzles don't evolve, they don't get any more difficult, they never get revisited with a different toolset. My greatest difficulty in the game was in fact figuring out where I was supposed to go next and not how to solve each puzzle.(That and the bugs, which forced me to quit and restart the game again and again as game objects glitched out and became impossible to interact with.)The really frustrating thing about this is that, as I said at the beginning, it had the potential to be great. Each individual puzzle element is clever, creative, and hints at the ingenious puzzles it could be used for - but never is.Stylistically speaking, it is also one of the most confused games I have ever seen: ""Let's do an early '80s setting! No, let's do a William Gibson-style cyberpunk setting! No, let's do steampunk!"". It has the feel of someone in the 30th century being asked to portray hacker life in the late 20th century without any research - and not in a charming way. The same goes for the graphics, which mix extreme minimalism with fancier effects in a way that feels less like a deliberate design choice than a way to save money on artists.A 4-hour game for 20 bucks is always hard to recommend. For a disappointing 4 hours, it's impossible. For now, save your money."
570,2429,"Great story, design, and gameplay. 4.7 out of 5 stars only because it took 2 (short) days to beat and the glitches that weren't fixed before I beat the game."
571,2429,"So far extremely fun. Once you get pasted the first few mission it really gets started. Lots of items to use. fun learning to write some simple code and learning how to time stuff out. I have written one line of code to complete an entire level after about 30 plays through lol but my one line of code will shut down all cameras and open all doors right at the second I get to them. That my friend is really cool, still really early in the game though. I fell in love when I could control the little robot doggy with command lines that make sense and easy to use. 10/10 for artistic style and  cyber thief game that is actually good."
572,2429,I've never played anything like this game. It allows you to control the world using simple commands that it teaches you throughout the game. Amazing atmosphere and new concept. Never played anything else like it.
573,2429,"Cowboy1.YeeHaw(3)Quadrilateral Cowboy scratches a very specific itch I didn't know I had. It's a fantastic stealth/puzzle game that makes me feel like a movie level hacker. Just the sounds of typing this out brings me back my favorite moments in the game. That's what I call immersion.Highly recommended for those looking for a more against the grain experience with strong, sold game mechanics."
574,2429,"So far this game is unlike no other-the atmosphere is very off and different, almost creepy. I'm having a ton of fun right now but I thought that it was more of a time based game.(I know that it is..) For instance at the first level I thought that I had to leave my computer behind so I created a batch file that opened all the grates and turned off the lasers only to find out after failing a few times that I could have brought it with me haha. I will update my review as my experiance continues!"
575,2429,Definitely one of the most satisfying puzzle games out there.
576,2429,Great game! I loved every part of it.
577,2429,Fantastic. The puzzles are fun and satisfying and it perfectly nails the setting. This is a game I'll be recomending to just about everyone I know.
578,2429,"This will be a changing review as I continue to play.I've played just over an hour now and early impressions are very good, stylish, brilliant game mechanics and overall I was left with a smile on my face.  This is the hacking game i've been waiting for.The price does seem a little high though is maybe my only concern as it may put some people of which would be a shame. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qc0ncXsVDXY"
579,2429,"This game is incredibly well thought out. It's very dense with little details that are delightful and satisfying to find and notice. The puzzles are interesting and require thought but I didn't find that they acted like a roadblock. I'm always impressed by how well Brendon Chung manages to push an atmosphere and a tone. Definitely worth checking out if you enjoyed any previous games by Blendo Games, or other puzzlers like TIS-100 or Human Resource Machine.It crashed a bunch, maybe 6 times in total. Most in a single aread towards the end of the game, but I couldn't figure out if a specific thing caused it. It saves very often so the most I lost was a minute or so but it was still a little frustrating.Would absolutely reccomend, though!"
580,2429,"See you, space cowboy."
581,2429,"I'll keep it simple;Great concept, good puzzles, great art design/atmosphere, smart story.It's a touch on the short side - I'd love to see bigger and more open-ended heists toward the end that better allow people to use their toolbox to create novel solutions to bigger puzzles. There's a ton of potential here for new levels, so hopefully either we'll get more from Blendo, or the modding community will step up and provide something.Either way, it wasn't unsatisfyingly short, and I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys this sort of dynamic, computer-based puzzling and/or retro-futuristic atmosphere."
582,2429,"A finely crafted puzzle-adventure that's unfortunately a little shortQuadrilateral Cowboy is a retro-cyberpunk heist/hacking game. If you want to compare it to something, think Thief and Uplink meshed together.As with all Chung's games, it's got a quirky, simplistic aesthetic that lends more focus to the narrative than the environments. The game is set during a retro-futuristic 1980 with airships, space elevators and oversized ventilation shafts.The basic gameplay consists of lugging around a chunky Osbornesque ""portable"" computer and using it to hack into security systems to open doors and windows, turn off laser grids and cameras, and so on. The computer lets you set up sequences of commands to create small scripts, optimally letting you simply walk through a building while doors and alarms toggle around you. I'd loved if this concept had been explored more, since only the last mission starts to approach the complexity I expected. The most complex thing you do consists of toggling four lasers after eachother with the little walking robot.I chalk this down to the game being too short. Chung's games tend to go in the ""short and sweet"" category, and narratively Quadrilateral Cowboy works perfectly in its three-to-four hour playtime. Mechanically, I was left wanting more.The story is fun, the characters are quirky and characterful (despite not saying anything), the gadgets have great potential that isn't fully realized, and there's apparently mod support out of the gate (makes sense considering the engine is open-source).I tihnk the mods might make this game really great. As it is now, it's simply very good. It's a Brendon Chung game. Buy it if you like his game. Buy it if you liked Thief or Uplink.Basically buy it. It'll only get better."
583,2429,Frame rate went to choppy chopsville the moment anything big happened in game (ie: riding the train in the intro)Then  game tries to be a portal rip off? What?Glad I got my refund.
584,2429,"This a quirky and unique game, it's the complete opposite of Watch Dogs (that I hated), while WD tries very hard to be edgy and make hacking with a smartphone looks like the coolest thing ever Quadrilateral Cowboy is quite the opposite: You're in a low poly latin american cyberpunk retrofuture, using big clunky computers with command line interfaces, it's the opposite of cool and yet genuinely cool."
585,2429,"A game in the same echelon of style as Thirty Flights of Loving/Gravity Bone, but with incredibly fun plan-and-execute gameplay and tons of improve-your-best-time appeal"
586,2429,"I'm in the mainframe. Hacking the planet. It might be a Unix system, but I don't really know what that is."
587,2429,"Really smart and inventive, doesn't overstay it's wlecome, all around amazing game."
588,2429,"Another brilliant game from Blendo Games. The art style is simple but attractive, and the core gameplay is great. I found it a bit Portal-esque, in that some of the puzzles stopped me up for a little while, but it was never terribly frustrating and I always felt clever when I solved it.I also really liked the cyberpunk-in-the-80s style of all the interfaces, and the little story interludes between missions were great. Very atmospheric and evocative when they needed to be."
589,2429,"Unique, beautiful, and extremely well crafted. Enjoyable command-line gameplay."
590,2429,"Play this game. It's really that simple.I think Thirty Flights left a bad taste in some people's mouths for being short and disjointed and while I loved the game for exactly those reasons, it's totally understandable. This is not that game. In truth, this is probably more like Portal than it is like Thirty Flights. Sure, the cube headed heist team is back, but the mechanics themselves are brilliant and satisfying, the puzzles are exactly that Portal-esque layering of teaching you different techniques and allowing you lightbulb moments.Not sure what my final time ended up being. ~5 hours, I think, and I'll likely play it again to improve a few of those level scores and read more of those hilarious object labels.Brendon, if you read this, thank you."
591,2429,Great game; if you like puzzles.However the game does feel as though it is more of a testbed for all of the mechanics introduced and it doesn't use them itself as much as it should.
592,2429,Just long enough that you can't refund it.
593,2429,"Brendon Chung is the Quentin Tarantino of videogames.Brendon has impeccable taste and you can tell he devours all kinds of cinema, literature, and games looking for that special ""something"" in all of them. Whether it's the sound of breathing during a spacewalk from Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", an interactable flushing toilet from ""Duke Nukem"", or just the term ""cowboy"" from William Gibson's ""Neuromancer.""This game takes these special ""somethings"" and combines them with Brendon's own world-building and story-telling to create something that is unique, refreshing, and exciting."
594,2429,only played it for 20 mins but the style gameplay of this game seems to very original and interesting.
595,2429,"I've been anticipating this game for the past couple of years and I can definitely say the wait has been worth it. An immersive hacking interface, fun spy gadgets, and a very curious setting indeed! The feeling of solving a puzzle with a flow of commands and quick thinking is quite a fun rush, and with Workshop support I look forward to seeing players' custom maps and other fun things like that!If you're a fan of hacking/typing games that allow you to manipulate the world through coding and commands (See also ComputerCraft for Minecraft, and Wiremod in Garry's Mod), I definitely recommend this!"
596,2429,"A fun hacking/stealth game, a little Deus Ex, a little Hacker Uplink, a little Monaco.  Extremely stylish, with a great sense of accomplishment when you unlock a level's twist.You play a hacker/theif, given missions, each of which will have one more more objectives, you load these up in VR deck and practice running them in the shortest time possible.  The missions themselves will have various puzzles to solve, many of which involve basic puzzles which you solve by telneting from your laptop to objects in the environment.The commands are very simple, but its the way you chain them together and time them with what is happening in the environment that gives the game its challenge.I cannot speak for long term challenge or game length, as I only have about an hour played, but it is very engaging and immersive and I can't wait to keep playing."
597,2429,"This game is crazy detailed and it's functionality is impressive, the gadgets involved are cool, the coding language is basic yet can do some cool tricks, interesting art style, would definitely recommend!"
598,2429,Something weird and different. a great little game definetley worth picking it up! absolutely love it!!!
599,2429,Played an interactive story where I was on a plane eating chili and then the plane exploded 10/10
600,2429,"TLDR:How long to complete:If you rush through it all, you can probably complete it in under 4 hours.Great style, references to the genre aplenty, explore, solve puzzles and throw in some terminal style typing to control/hack your environment. 9/10 - If it had an 80's mix of electronica in the soundtrack it would have been epic.Extras:Developer Commentary is a great touch to check out after completing the game.Credits are unique and fit the game's style spot on.Modding - It should be interesting what the community and/or Blendo releases in the future!Extended:First of all.. Its a straight up puzzle solving game with STAGES.Then it's a command-via-typing / exploration style game.For those wondering: I'd say it's 50/50 with typing and exploring - Some more than others at times.Instead of interacting with things point blank, you enter commands on your ""mobile"" terminal, control robots, fire weapons, use jump pads and more! Feels like pieces of other titles meshed together with a unique art style in the process of being perfected by Blendo. After the first portion of the solo play it splits into a multi-mode where you case, engineer and grease your way through stages. The trick being the actions you do in time affect the next mode you play. It's a fun twist and change to the first portion.Without ruining too much of the puzzle aspect of the game, the stages have been very thought out and the more items you unlock, the harder things get.Be prepared to restart stages to achieve the fastest times without penalties.Say hello to Chu Chu the black-market cat."
601,2429,"I have been waiting for this game since playing Gravity Bone and her sister game Thirty Flights Of Loving. I am so glad he was able to finish development of the game. And may I say, this game is brilliant! It really does make you feel like a Cyber Punk hacker! I recommend playing this game as it is very entertaining. I hope to see more from Brendon Chung as he has very much impressed me with this game."
602,2429,"THIS GAME IS AMAZING, really fun game that has alot to offer. I would say the price is okay for a game. The gameplay mechanics are amaxing but funny at the same time. I failed a mission at one point in the game becuase of a alarm and got shot by a turrent out the window, had to restart cuz i didnt die from the fall. You also get a cute litte robot that you can program to mvoe aronnd the map, if you love the concept of programming and puzzles, then thi sgame is for you."
603,2429,Blendo at its finest!
604,2429,"I just finished playing the first few missions of this game, and I am pretty impressed. The main aim of the game is to infiltrate buildings by using a laptop to hack your way in. Very user-friendly, teaches you the mechanics step-by-step. Potential replayability, with workshop compatibility._Pros_-Makes you feel like a hacker-Cool retro cyberpunk feel-Intense. challenging, and fast-paced puzzles-Cool mechanics_Cons_-Lack of atmosphere while outside-Thats all I could think of, I haven't run into any bugs yet :)So far, i give this game a 7/10I HAVE NOT COMPLETED THE GAME, NOR AM I CLOSE TO BEATING THE GAME.

606,2429,Great stuff from Blendo!
607,2429,"Unique, original gameplay based on real world programming. Perform heists by writing simple scripts on a virtual laptop. I am not a programmer myself but it was easy enough to understand what to do as the game does a great job helping you, without giving away too much. Very fun puzzles with a bit of Portal-esque timing thrown in. New gameplay options are thrown in at a nice pace with a lot of cool surprises. It has a lovely setting and art style too, this might well land on my favorite games list! Just awesome."
608,2429,I rememeber playing thirty flights of loving in dec 2013 then found out about this i was stoked as being a fan of this genre and this was worth the wait. Also my favorite blendo games production so far.
609,2429,"Been waiting for this game for years.Its smart, charming, and can be somewhat challenging.  When taken in the context of the type of game this is, it represents everything that indie game development should be.Edit: In keeping with full disclosure, the game does ultimately fall short of its full potential by not combining all the challenging elements as well as they could be.  However, this does not take away from what the game is, and brilliance of what the game did right (which is most of it)."
610,2429,"Played through the intro and first mission and so far I'm LOVING it! If you didn't like Thirty Flights of Loving, don't worry, this game has a more traditional gameplay narrative that will probably appeal more to you. If you DID enjoy Thirty Flights of Loving, don't worry, this game feels like Thirty Flights x100. The setting, tone, and art style mesh perfectly, and the gameplay and puzzle solving is really crisp. As someone who has been looking for a hacking game that feels like you're actually doing some hacking, I'm happy to say I've finally found that experience with Quadrilateral Cowboy. I can't wait to play more!UPDATE: I've played a bit more and it just keeps getting better. The items you get throughout the game are really fun to play with and add new puzzle mechanics to each level. The moments between missions are just as engaging, allowing you to learn more about the main character - Poncho - and her crew, without any dialogue or written exposition; it's like a filmmaker's wet dream. Everything about this game feels thought out and polished. I can't recommend it enough!"
611,2429,"Robbed a bank. Celebrated it by playing badminton.10/10, would play badminton again."
612,2429,"Quadrilateral Cowboy is a clever puzzle game about space and the world around you, told through hacking, gadgets, and Chung's amazing direction. Chung's games have always been about packing the world with detail and secrets and story and meaning, and QC sort of brings that out mechanically too - you need to understand the environment to find solutions, and that means you end up paying attention to all the small touches and flourishes in each world.Timings and leaderboards sort of put an unnecessary pressure on gameplay, and it can make it tempting to rush in and power through to the best solution. I can't see a way to turn them off, but I recommend just sort of breezing through it on your first run and not worrying about optimality. It's best to take each little place as it comes, and poke and explore it to get the most out of it.It's fun! I'm still playing through it. But it's a good time."
613,2429,"They told me I could hack the world in a retro-futuristic cyberpunk setting and I actually did it!But seriously, if you like: programming, Thirty Flights of Loving, all girl hacker teams, funny names, chili, cyberpunk, and environmental storytelling- I would seriously recommend this.PRO TIP: you can look around while decking."
614,2429,"Fantastic, can be a little on the short side but with mod support implemented there's plenty more to see"
