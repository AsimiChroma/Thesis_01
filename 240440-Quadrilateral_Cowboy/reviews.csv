Going into it, I wasn't sure I would enjoy the aesthetic--early 20th century music and decor with retro computer tech plus sci-fi mega-cities, and cybernetic augmentations. But in the levels where all three 'eras' of design are combined, it creates a unique and truly pleasing setting. An station with hallways of art nouveau windows, letting in red light from the sun setting in the upper atmosphere, leading to 70s-like hospital wards of light-green tile, where you're meant to download a patient's electronic brain. (It's a shame that level didn't work on Linux; it's a good port overall but myself and others on Linux have run into a gamebreaking bug with the doors there.) Normally I would worry that too much gameplay would water down a series like this, that has so far been far more style than substance. But the levels are so dense with interactivity and props to inspect, that the two really drive each other.Extremely creative, it truly feels like there is a great vision creating the game. Despite being significantly longer than previous games, I am as always left wanting more, and anticipating whatever comes next."

240440,14,1,Michaelzee1,497,34,-1,3.0,"January 1, 2019","It's hard to decide whether to recommend this game.  Ultimately I have to say no, though I fully believe many will love it, but in the end I put it down.First thing I should caveat this with is I'm REALLY not a fan of the Blendo games' style.  I think the blocky, low-poly visuals and washed-out, muted colors look really awful, and I just don't buy the idea that a game can look ""good"" by deliberately trying to look dated visually.  I'm not a ♥♥♥♥♥ for presentation, but a nice presentation goes a long way to make up for shortcomings elsewhere in a game.  Here, the terrible graphics and limited use of sound are only a detriment.The actual gameplay is where this game shines, and is at odds with the game's design at almost every turn.  The idea is you pull off heists by interacting with the world via a simple computer interface, where you code command lines to switch off lasers, open doors, aim guns, etc.  This felt wholly original and unique to me and for a while I was having a LOT of fun with it. Even the clunkiness honestly adds to the experience (for example, lots of trial error in determining how far to zoom in, where to aim a gun, things like this).  But it adds to the experience because it feels like you're actually programming and solving problems via this computer interface.  It's cool.I just wish this concept was put into a better GAME.  The design decisions in Quadrilateral Cowboy are baffling.  Aside from the whole game feeling like a tech demo, here are some of the annoyances I had in the couple hours I've played:1. Lots of levels have intant-fail conditions that take you back to the beginning if you're not extremely careful at every step.  In some sense these can add to it too (like needing to open a window before shooting a bullet through it or an alarm will go off, or planning out how to escape a room in 10 seconds knowing an alarm is going to go off soon).  But the fact that the levels have no checkpoints meants you'll be going back to the beginning sometimes only to slug your way through the same 90% you've already done just to get the timing of that last 10% down right.  It's annoying.2. The game doesn't build.  It introduces new mechanics and then quickly forgets about them more often than not.3. The jumping mechanic is ridiculous.  There was one level where I was stuck for a while because I couldn't figure out how to progress, only to realize I needed to jump onto a platform that's like 20 feet high (apparently the main character can jump REALLY high for no clear reason).  But the need to jump in that level made absolutely no sense in terms of design - it wasn't a platforming segment, there was no challenge involved, there was just one very specific moment where you had to jump once and that's it.  Very strange.4. There's a story, but it's doled out in short, weird, obtuse bits that make very little sense on their own, and I quickly lost interest trying to piece it together.  I also absolutely hated Thirty Flights of Loving and thought it was a complete waste of money, so take that for what it's worth, because the storytelling here is similar.Overall, I just wish a developer would take this concept and polish it into a game that's more worth playing, with a better presentation, more cohesive design and mechanics that actually build on one another and introduce themselves at a pace that makes sense.  What's here now is worth trying if you can get it on sale, but otherwise it's hard to recommend."

Gotta make use of a deck with various gadgets at your disposal, including a remote control robot and gun, among some others. interestingly enough it manages to get by on a cute little story about three girls and their independent hacker company, Impala Solutions. There's the same charming blocky style as seen in Gravity Bone and Thirty Flights of Loving and the game is more straightforward about its plot. Beware this is a short game and 20 bucks might be a tad pricy for some. In fact, there's only about 9 or so actual missions (with about 3 objectives, or mini missions, per level) intercut with little segments in between and they don't really fully utilize everything they teach you in the levels up to that point. Aside from that, there's a couple of mods in the workshop (unfortunately there's not many) that are considerably more thorough.Quadrilateral Cowboy is a neat, arty little cyberpunk game for those who like the art style and midly interested in what programming entails, and know little to nothing about it.

I like the changes in environment and all the tools used in the game are each interesting in their own way. For anyone interested in console commands computer hacking and heists, this is a great game. But thought my playthrough something was bothering me. I kept asking ""Why is my character doing these things?"" and that is never answered which leaves a narrative hole that I wish was filled. This hole is the motivations of the player-character. The best narrative objectives in video games will provide an urgency and purpose to the gameplay, but Quadrilateral Cowboy is devoid of any purposes behind any of the player's actions other than the objective of the current level.

IF the overall gameplay is good, you may ignore the  elementary graphic; or maybe you can call it a form of minimalist art...I don't really mind, what matter is that the game is moderately fun.You are fundamentally hacking your way to specific objectives; although what I saw in the first few missions is kinda limited. You have a portable hacking device, which simulate a terminal; so you can run commands to do certain things, although there is not much variety. You can see the name of the specific object you can interact with (so camera3, grate1 and  so on), so all you do is to type in terminal the name with a dot and then you can either turn that device on or off, or open and close it. Optionally you can specify for how long the item stay open or off, and that is helpful when you have alarms triggered by how long a door or a camera stay off.Now, this is great, but fundamentally there are flaws: the first is that you already know the name of what you want to access. The second is that we assume that the device can just connect wirelessly; while in the tutorial you need to find plugs; which makes more sense.The third and most enraging one, is that it is not much of a game where you figure out how to bypass something, but it is a time-based game.For example, you have capsules with one time code that goes through pressure pipes; although at times you have lasers that trigger an alarm if you have the capsule go by, without deactivate the laser (which can't be deactivated for more than 3 seconds or the alarm trigger anyway); so you end up - putting down your computer- pull a lever- look at the capsule, and when it is close by, you select the computer so you can interact with it, and send the command.If all goes well, you pass; otherwise the laser trigger and the capsule explode, and you get penalized. While I find this challenging, it is not challenging me to find a solution, but just forcing me to be fast in logging in and out of the computer to send commands to deactivate stuff... and goes without saying that if you are logged in the computer, your visual is kinda obstructed, and require you to be super fast with commands. You can push up arrow to recall a command, so that speed up things, but I am disappointed that the game does not rely on how smart I am at find a solution or write code to bypass something, but instead rely on how fast I can switch between items.The premises are great, but the implementation is a bit lackluster. it would take not much more to implement a sort of simple scripting where you have to time things with wait() and verify sensor states getting their properties (or maybe ping each generically named item to see if that is the one you need to access, instead of reading the name right on top of it).I assumed the game was marketed to the likes that play games like Uplink or other similar hacking games; while it seems to be more of an arcade game, with hacker scenarios.In the end, it is not a bad game, and I recommend it; but the premises are really good, and if you could add a better graphic; maybe VR support and puzzle that are more aimed at solving issue, instead than just being fast with your fingers; that would really make this game the #1 game for hackers-style games.Lots of fun playing it; and it is really easy to get lost in it for a long time"

240440,5,0,acidviper,91,5,-1,6.0,"February 18, 2018","My first encounter with this game was while it was in development. It was being shown in a trailer at a PAX show, and it seemed like it was going to be the first game to allow the player to use programming to solve interactive problems in a FPS. I was pretty excited for that, but after years in development and waiting for the macOS port, I see that it changed a lot from its early vision. What remains is an incredible aesthetic but an easy and short 5 hour game where your band of 3 lady hackers complete a series of virtual heists. There are puzzles, but they are light scripting if you can even call it that. Nothing that feels like programming ever comes into it. You'll ""jack in"" to wall sockets and trigger this and that with keyboard commands, but mostly it follows the tradition of ""find the door trigger that opens the door"". With the twist being that sometimes you have to place a remotely triggered device and work on your timing. There is no multiplayer, despite the introduction of a gameplay style halfway through the game where you have to switch between two characters to cooperatively solve tasks in tandem.The gameplay changes every stage or two, and it doesn't build upon itself necessarily. It's just continually experimenting with ideas and then throwing them away. You're on a train, you're robbing a house, you're in space now. Robots attack your hideout. You're on an airship. A badminton mini-game. All right...I get it, this game wants you to know it's quirky.Anyway, beyond some light brainteasers, this is a game about the visual art. Quadrilateral Cowboy has no dialogue or plot, moving between discrete and disconnected missions with only wah-wah-wah Charlie Brown style dialogue, if any at all. It's strictly visual storytelling. It fitting with the hipster aesthic, the game is set in a fictional 1979 or 1980, with plenty of retro computing artifacts and obvious influences from Wes Andersen's cinematic style.The soundtrack consists of a handful of public domain tunes from the early 20th century (plus a recurring rendition of Claire de Lune) which the player can select from at any time, using a walkman-like portable record-player item. Visually, the game is a cross between dark cyberpunk and an absurdist comedy, similar to JazzPunk. Thanks to the idTech4 engine, it runs at a good frame rate on an old mid-2010 MacBook Pro.I would recommend the game if you are a fan of charming indie efforts, but do not look for a serious programmer-style challenge along the lines of a Zachtronics game. The controls are clumsy, especially when trying to place your deck or TV on the ground. Multiple bugs will affect your gameplay – mostly minor, but in my short playthrough it crashed to the main menu or crashed out of the game entirely more than once. Another bug can cause your character to ""choke from lack of oxygen"" in any outer-space level where you are safely indoors."

But there is a pretty vibrant community making more levels.The concept is brilliant, the game design and thematics are wonderful, there's all sorts of twists and it gradually gets more intense.Unfortunately the entire campaign feels more like a set of tutorial levels- each level introduces a new mechanic and focuses upon it. It doesn't explore all the possible complexities and some combinations of tools/abilities are only used once. But that leaves SO MUCH ROOM for the community to make some really amazing levels.The actual fun I had working out each puzzle reminded me of portal.

More levels utilising the full tool set would have been great, as the last few missions are the best of the bunch; seeing  you slowly stake out a level, figure out what to do in what order, then put your plan into glorious motion.

It constantly introduces new and interesting mechanics before you can get bored with any of them. The short campaign (which was approximately 3.5 hours) serves as a great showcase for all the abilities, but I think Quadrilateral Cowboy’s true potential would be community made maps/heists. The game gives the player amazing tools, but doesn’t fully utilize them; Something that would be perfect for community made maps. Unfortunately there is no level editor like in Portal 2 to allow for the small community to produce content without knowing how to fully mod, in external programs. Overall, without a level editor to reach its true potential, Quadrilateral Cowboy offers amazing tools but does not fully utilize them. I would recommend picking this one up on sale."
240440,0,0,win8linux,191,14,1,10.0,"January 6, 2018","This game is somewhat reminiscent of Jazzpunk, another indie game. Both have cyberpunk environments, humor scattered everywhere (especially objects), and a charming cast of characters. However, this game is about Hollywood-esque hacking and heists in a cyberpunk's reimagining of the 1980s instead of Bond-ish espionage in a Cold War-stylized future. There's a plot, but it is optional since knowing about it inside the game requires careful observation of the levels.There is a terminal on your portable deck, wherein you will have to type commands to interact with hackable objects. Newbies and people who aren't good at computers shouldn't worry too much since the game provides instructions all the way through the end; there are even signs in the early levels inscribed with examples of said commands and the optional advanced features.If you are tech savvy, a prosumer, programmer, and/or interested in computers, then you'll enjoy the game even more; there are references to old and new technology aplenty, even in the items that are provided. It is possible to finish some levels with only one command and a bit of going around them. This is due to the in-game terminal (not the debug console) allowing basic pipes for commands; for those who don't know, this allows for combining multiple commands into one. There are a few other advanced CLI features in there, but I'd suggest playing the game to find out more about them.In conclusion, this is a phenomenal indie game with a good albeit optional plot, peculiar and interesting gameplay, great retro cyberpunk-ish atmosphere, and chock full of pop culture-laden subtle and blatant humor. A must-play, for sure."

The story, shown (not told) by little more than crudely textured polygons and a few sound effects, is not your latest Hollywood thriller, but is far from bland. I did not learn all the playable characters' names until more than halfway through the game, yet I feel I learned alot about them from their style of problem solving.

Unlike the terminal hacker sims it's frequently compared to, your goal in each level is just to use the mechanic exactly as it's presented to you, and most of the losses you experience will occur because of the wonky physics engine or the game not clearly explaining which devices you can only disable for set intervals; rather than needing to actually rethink and refine your code. There's a particularly exhausting level in which you have to wait MINUTES at a time for a quadrupedal drone to shamble across a plain room to the mission objective, after which your completing or repeating the entire mission depends on a physics object whose trajectory you can't telegraph landing in the right place.Halfway through, the gameplay changes completely and no longer includes the hacking element at all; becoming a thoroughly generic and uninteresting timing-based strategy platformer like a clunkier Braid.Would not recommend, especially not to someone who loved Uplink and Hacknet and is looking for the next big thing - this isn't it."

This game stands out from the crowd.  Its a unique game mechanic which might be a little dawnting for some, its a breath of fresh air.. Starting off with simple commands to strings of code.. Ok maybe not strings since its limited to 3 commands at a time but still.... Whilst short, at only around 5.5 hrs. Its well worth the money. THe air style my deter some folks with its very basic blocky vector art... Even so i do enjoy it.The ONLY Negitive i have about since game is towards the ending.... WTF was that all about? I won't spoil anything (and no its nothing game breaking or something that should stray you away from this game) but really? A sudden change of gameplay was a little unexpected.. Granted its only for a couple of missions but still... Kinda broke the flow a little.Oh and story is a non excistant (kinda like my spelling!) We're just dropped into the game and off we go.. All we know is that we're friends from School days and we hack stuff for money. Not a deal breaker but a little clarification would have been nice.Over all its a lovely little game.

If you are worried about the use of hacking, command lines, programming (i.e. if you have zero experience with those sorts of things) then you have absolutely nothing to worry about. The game provides newbs with tons of instructions via various notes and signs hanging around. Especially in the early levels that tell you basically EXACTLY what to type.Unlike other games in the ""hacker"" genre, this game is more about heists. So instead of just sitting at a computer typing commands, cracking passwords, decrypting files, etc, you will be using a portable computer deck to hack your way through doors, vents, security cameras, laser fields, etc.The beauty of the game is that if you have zero programming experience whatsoever, you will still be able to play and enjoy this game using only a handful of simple commands. On the other hand, if you have dabbled in programming or are a full-fledged programming nerd, there are optional/advanced programming features to play with, such as creating your own batch files, which the game remembers, even between levels.One of the most original puzzle games I've played in a while!

This game is like nothing else I've played. I love the sense of achievement you get when you solve a puzzle; you feel like a 1337 h4x0r. What's more, each stage is nothing like the last. Just when you begin to get comfortable with the game systems it's teaching you, the game throws them out the window and moves on to something entirely different. It's a really daring design choice.

Those seem simplistic to me.  Some hacking games bog you down in a pure command line.  Those feel like work.  I think that this game was very well balanced in that respect.I like to approach games like this without knowing anything about them because they're such a joy to discover as you go.  That said, some specifics on what the game is about if you don't mind more details: Essentially, you pull off a series of heists and you have various little programmable gadgets to help you do so.  Sometimes there are time limits.  Sometimes you are working in parallel with yourself.  In the end, each mission felt very satisfying.And a couple of things to help you enjoy the game and not get stuck like I did exactly once: If you're into exploration, I highly recommend reading everything with text on it. There were some wine bottles with clever labels in the very first intro mission, and those got me started enjoying the fine print during the rest of the game.I had a lovely time and I can already think of several friends that I know will enjoy it as well."

There are a few ways to solve the different puzzles. My only problem is with how short it is. It introduces a concept, there is one level that showcases that feature and then it moves on. After a few hours, you're introduced to all the concepts and then the game ends. There seems to be a couple features that the game never brings up that I never found a use for. Like the weevil magnet. I never used this, and I'm not sure why it is in the game. The story is kind of interesting, it's a few friends working towards something. To be honest though, I was mostly just interested in solving the puzzles and wasn't paying attention to what the overall plot was.If 3-5 hours of chill out puzzle solving is worth whatever price this is at the time, get it. But that's all you're getting. It seems like this was expected to take off with user made mods in the steam workshop, but there's nothing there a year after release."

I think part of the reason why is that I didn't have very defined expectations. Another reason is that I've been pulled away from longer games simply because of circumstance. So you could say that what Quadrilateral Cowboy actually offered was exactly what I needed at the time of playing it. And what it offers is some of the most subtle, intimate storytelling in gaming intertwined with what I would also call subtle, intimate puzzles. Puzzles with clever solutions but in which the solution is not the most important element.The highlight of this game is the physicality of the objects you interact with. It is the internal consistency of the tools at your disposal. If it's true that the game never combines all it's elements to present you with truly complicated puzzle challenges (a la Portal, The Witness or Stephen's Sausage Roll), it is also true that the game doesn't really aim for that kind of brainteaser. It has just as much puzzle as is necessary to make you feel in it's world, breaking into things, hacking weird stuff, downoading brain content, sticking it up the corporate overlord. Even though many of the puzzles are  simple, I will never forget how they made me feel. As the story of the three girls progressed, I became part of this rag-tag band of absurd hacker-heros in a way that will stay with me for a long time.So that's why it has become a most memorable game for me. It is short and sweet. It is subtle and feels profound without posturing or ridiculous gestures of intellectual grandeur (looking at you, Bioshock Infinite). It has great gameplay that you can interact with at the pace of a narrative sensation that encompasses you (never do you need to stop and think for a duration of time in which you are no longer a character and become instead a solver, a detached entity with a notepad and a brain).It is little escapade into a world I wish existed.

It's kinda buggy though. I had multiple crashes. I had to quit a level and get back sometimes as the game state can get messed up.

Cons:No overarching story or subplots to follow, only out-of-place recreation sequences attempting to add depth to characters. Simplistic puzzles where the main mechanic appears to be speed running, pivoting around the gadget-of-the-day. No real depth to puzzles requiring a multitude of techniques to overcome, or replayability via trying different approaches. Perhaps most disappointing was the hacking element, which was really more of hacking theatre. Imagine driving a controller with command line inputs and that's the gist of it.Pros:A minimalistic art style paired with a music theme I highly enjoyed. Many of the stability issues seem to have been addressed.Recommendations: Hope for a writer & level designer + more time I suppose.

Multiple weevers, or using the weever and autocase simultaneously, are never explored even though the tools and commands hint at the possibility. Workshop support really SHOULD make up for some of these flaws, but six months later only a handful of levels even exist. The plot and backstory stuff feels like it's building up to something big, but it never gets there which is unusual given the developer's past works. The game does a good job of establishing the basics of who these people you're playing as are in between levels, but there's never a moment where these relationships are tested or a true antagonist emerges. Some really cool things happen, and then they just stop happening. Apparently you're playing the first two years of a 15+ year career before flashing forward to old age in the epilogue, where they show off all the equipment you would've gotten. SUCH a tease... On a technical level the game runs fine, but a couple of level breaking bugs forced me to close and reopen the game in order to reattempt the level.After the reputation built up from Gravity Bone and Thirty Flights of Loving, I was just expecting more than the game gave me. If you're a puzzle fanatic and just want to tool around with some interesting mechanics, then by all means go for it. If you're expecting this to grab your attention in any other way, move on."

The quirkiness of that cat that sells you things and then give birth to a bunch of kittens and then it's a different cat the next time you visit the shop.I love the seamless worldbuilding, the way everything is shown, not told. I felt so immersed, invested and attached to the game world and the characters, even though they never said a word. It's probably BECAUSE they never said a word, and as a player, I gave them words, I filled in the blanks and interpreted their personality and character. Maybe that's why I felt so attached.The puzzles never got too hard. But I like it that way, it keeps the game going at a steady pace.

I rediscovered it this week, but thought it was a little overpriced for what I expected to be a 5-7 hour game. Watched a video of the first 10 minutes and decided it was perfect for me, and to go for it.Regret.That's the main feeling I get after playing this game.Pros:Good visuals, given the engine and graphical style.Gameplay feels ImmersiveCons:Short. Really short. Even shorter than I expected. HLTB said 6.5 hours, 5.5 rushed. I didn't rush the game and even idled some, and I still came out at 4.9 hours.The story is just awful.  You get the general picture but there's no detail to really drag you in, or feel involved. It doesn't tie the levels together whatsoever. It just feels like you're doing the next level because.. it's next. The story goes from hacking to getting attacked to flying. There's nothing that ties it together.. except maybe sisterhood? I didn't feel it. They're friends. Who ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ cares?Buggy. Even months after release, issues the dev thinks they've fixed keep happening. Visual bugs, bugs while restarting a level, bugs with the deck so you can't issue commands properly, which persists through saves and reloads. Bugs everywhere.Sound felt very cheap at times.Mods? This game has been out for 5 months and has 4 mods on the Steam Workshop. This isn't the dev's fault, but if they wasted time integrating the workshop for this, someone is at fault.Puzzles go from easy to hard to easy. There's no consistency whatsoever, and the game does a horrible job of explaining some mechanics. Most are easy to understand, but if you miss a detail, it gets confusing quickly.Overall, it's a neat idea but it doesn't execute its goal very well. I'd give it a 6/10.

This simplicity can be blamed on the fact that little is done to combine the mechanics which are gradually taught as the game progresses.

After running it for a couple of hours, the game will spontaneously lock up. Sometimes when I load the game it will load into a 640x480 window and freeze. And sometimes when I play, I am not able to cycle back through the keyboard commands without it also adding a carriage return. (IE, if my last command was ""test"" I should be able to hit the up arrow to get the ""test"" command line to appear in my current field--however, while it does bring up the ""test"" command it effectively hits <ENTER> executing the command by itself). Most of the time I can just cycle through all of my previous commands with no issues, but once this started happening, I have not been able to stop it from happening.

In this case, those vague remnants of vital information aren't scattered throughout internet forum posts. Instead, they are provided up front and choreographed in intervals, often in a respectably hands-off way. Whereas the later portions of other puzzlers may treat wrong steps as progress away from the answer, experimenting in Quadrilateral Cowboy feels like progressing towards a solution.It's a light coding puzzler that condenses the joy of successful algorithmic logic inside interesting 3D applications. There's a level of apparent complexity that comes from the raw technology/hacker aesthetic that helps to make any sort of tampering feel intelligent. The visuals are appealingly gameplay-first, which perfectly mirrors the makeshift/alpha-test styling of retro-futuristic VR heist planning.By the end, the game felt criminally short. Since there's a new tool to learn in each chapter, most of the concepts don’t receive direct collaboration with one another. It's a shame that there wasn't much of a chance to more deeply blend various tools. Despite it making sense for the context of the puzzles, being on a timer for many heists was a bit of a drag. The solutions in those scenarios were often less complex than efficiently executing each of the subsequent tasks that had already been individually solved long ago.Even if it can be picky at times, Quadrilateral Cowboy is still generally ingenious and fascinating to someone with an adoration for retro/DIY electronics and a growing knowledge of software development. It’s certainly worth your consideration if one of your natural habitats are IDEs and you're sick of disjointed resources being better educators than your professors are."

It gradually introduces you to its mechanics, but once it introduces all of them, you only get one level wherein you get to utilize them all.  The result is that most of the game feels like a tutorial, and it never really puts you to the test in any way.  Still, what is here is great, and wholly unique.  This is my first Blendo game and I'm very impressed and will definitely be checking out more from them."

240440,0,0,76561198045754600,205,19,1,8.4,"April 9, 2021","Generally fun and sweet game about hacking/programming and using cool bits of tech to do relatively simple heists.Hacking/Programming - Main part of the game. Simple enough for people with no coding experience to do, but enough for people with coding experience to find enjoyable, but not challenging. The tech is fun to use, though simplistic, they have their own functions in code and usage which add some variety.Story - Not sure there was one, with no dialogue and little explanation I'm sure I either missed the story or the idea was for an experience more than a traditional story format. Still enjoyable, even if it didn't feel like it had an end per say. The setting is quite cosy with themes of friendship and hard work in a strange futuristic world, this allows it to not be as serious or miserable as a lot of futuristic/dystopian pieces of media.Bugs - Did notice quite a few bugs that should have been fixed as they are quite blatant. If this was a longer, more fleshed out experience I think i would have had more issue with the bugs, but since it was short and sweet, I didn't spend enough time playing to get frustrated by it. Bare in mind a decent amount of my playtime recorded on here was idle in the pause menu so that isn't accurate.Overall it is sweet, short and simple. Which I can see may not be something coding/puzzle enthusiasts would want as it doesn't really get too complex or deep (personally I would have preferred more coding and tech depth since I have limited coding experience). But if you want a fun experience with a bit of coding and tech it is definitely worth buying on sale for a quick enjoyable experience.When I Stopped:I completed it and am glad I did.7/10+ Fun and satisfying gameplay+ Sweet albeit simple story/theme+ Lets you feel cool and like you are learning as the game progresses- Too simple for my tastes- A little bit buggy- Story is vague and leaves you foggy on the point of everything"
240440,1,0,whoaLare,032,123,1,7.0,"March 26, 2021",A beautifully tight yet complex game about using command lines to manipulate devices to steal things from people and with a lovely art style reflective of times when processing speeds where measured in terms of kilobytes.  They could have this game overwhelming in terms of level design but I think they nailed it with tight levels with a more or less singular focus on a given function at least until the last 2-3 levels where everything really comes together.  There's some really clever ways to break levels but even that requires thinking so far outside of the box that you'll have to pick up your brain afterwards.  The ending was unexpectedly heavy but in a really sweet way and the fact Blendo was able to tell a story that is as much about friendships and the passing of time as it is about manually adjusting the angle of your aimbot-enabled sniper rifle in order to shoot the laser grid deactivation button via embedded command prompts ('blinks') so you can safely advance your remotely connected scout bot ('weever') is a genuine achievement.

The artwork is fantastic; zaney, techy and surreal, very reminiscent of  Jazzpunk , a style that I'm pretty crazy for.  On top of that, there's some mild in-game programming.  It's a simplified command line (MS-DOS) and doesn't require any coding experience, but if you do have some previous exposure you may have fun writing some recursive batch files, at your own risk that is :)Only draw back to this fantastic game is that it's a bit short (i.e. it's exactly like Jazzpunk).  My play through was a little shy of 8 hours, though I think for others it may be a little shorter as I like to really take in the scenery and perfect my solutions to games like this.  TL;DR - This game is a work of art, and like all art some people will appreciate it more than others.  For some it will be the best game ever, while others may hate it.  My advice? Give it a shot!"

The style is similar, however this game focuses a lot more on puzzles than a strange story experience. There are some strange and funny moments in the game, but they are not in focus as they were in previous games.The hacking mechanic is really fun, however, as the game progresses, it is used less in favor of other puzzle elements (jumping puzzles, controlling multiple characters, etc.), which are still fun, but i thought it would be good to mention.Some slight spoilers: The game ends in a rather abrupt way. It's just Last Job -> Done -> Credits. Again, if you played the previous games, you might end up a little dissapointed.Overall, i would give the game a 7/10, just for trying something new with the hacking mechanic.Story of Gravity Bone + Gameplay of Quadrilateral Cowboy = Dream Combohttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-L-jCr18g"

It rewards exploration and observation; there are plenty of nice touches and cool details and references all over the game that I loved and really added to the surreal 1980s cyberpunk atmosphere.If I had to level a criticism at this game as it stands, I think some of the levels could do with a bit more depth - each level is quite short and perhaps the clever mechanics deserve to be explored further.  I think there is a good chance that mods and community levels will keep the game fresh after finishing the campaign.A great effort and I am very content having paid full price for what is a really fun and unique game."

Notorious because this is another game that you shouldn't buy for the quantity/price ratio. (The Interactive Art Book is overpriced for the extra $9, but as a horribly rabid fanboy I consider it a tip for the funding of future projects in the Citizen Abel universe.)At release the game is $20 for 6-10 hours of content which most people should find outrageous, but I find that the experience never outstays its welcome.The hacking feature is a total lie, as it boils down to a fancy lever pulling mechanic. But the implementation of the decking interface is just so finely tuned to fit with the environments that I found the glorified command line typing to be extremely immersive.Art _quality in this game is amateurish but the art _direction is insanely brilliant. It's a joy to see how the sum of clunky blocks and hand-drawn doodles are combined into a scene that engages the imagination.A bunch of interesting gameplay ideas are introduced with clever focus, but I was disappointed that those same ideas were never combined together into a cohesive climax.Extras like the timed leaderboards and sticky notes left by friends are clever, but with the bugs plaguing global sync, it is hard to take such features seriously.If you want to feel like a hacker in some 90s techno-exploitation flick, Quadrilateral Cowboy absolutely nails the execution.

240440,9,0,amnaumen,884,13,1,7.1,"August 17, 2016","Blendo took a giant step in the right direction with this game. With some of Blendos previous games they could be considered ""non-games"" to some due to perceived lack of gameplay and more of a walking simulator with light platforming feel. But with Quadrilateral Cowboy there is much more of an emphasis on gameplay using items and hacking to complete puzzles.The puzzles are mostly basic and pretty easy until the final few which blend together most of the tools you have learned through the game. My biggest complaint with the game is that there wasn't a single puzzle that used everything you have learned and you entire arsenal in one giant climactic puzzle, instead you are left wondering what could have been which may be intentional seeing as the story is deliberately left that way too.Old fans of Blendo will not be surprised by the subdued storytelling, but for some it might be a turnoff. A lot is left to the player to piece together through intuition and studying the environment, which in my opinion is needed me in storytelling in gaming.Another complaint is the length but that is mostly because I wanted more of the game as I loved it so much. Workshop support should help that out with (as of publication of this review) free maps being uploaded by the developers and fan maps hopefully becoming a thing in the future.If you like puzzle games you owe it to yourself to play this."

The style is bold and strange, but appealing at the same time, and the puzzles are all very well-designed, with most of them really making you feel like you're infiltrating some sort of high-security base just with your laptop and a few other little gadgets.

There are elements of gameplay that feel pointless, and a few times they warn you of consequences that don't actually occur.I feel like this game was oversold.

The puzzles aren't super extremely difficult nor have multiple ways to solve them but they really function more for world building and character development. For a story without any diologue it does rather good job doing that. Brendon Chung definitely has a way of constructing stakes just through presentation an editing alone.And the puzzles are actually satifying to solve. I'm sure if you were acustomed to using DOS, the learning curve of typing commands to run programs will not take some getting use to. For someone born in 1991, like myself, it has a certain novelty to it and it is fun to get the hang of it after trial and error and learning shortcuts. All I can say is that for myself the game did a good job of making me feel like an elite super hacker.It's a nice bittersweet experience, like most of Brendon Chung's work.

Please keep doing the work you have been doing, and especially if you continue to add to Quadrilateral Cowboy, an already excellent and complete game.Review: This game is full of cyberpunk ""jobs"" that you do with two other characters, in a fully stylized world. With the use of multiple gadgets and hacking, you can use an easy to learn programming language to utilize them to break into highly secured places. Its a bit of a challenge to program multiple tasks, but it is very open ended in how you can do your programming. About 2 missions were a bit of a pain, due to me trying to figure out how not to get stuck in laser grids, but they were doable, and most of the many missions are not so very hard to figure out. I recommend this game to anyone who wants to challenge themselves with a game that uses objects and coding together to complete objectives, and anyone that has enjoyed Blendo Games work before.THE LARGEST PRO: The game itself is strangely emotional, and beautiful. The gameplay is solid but the unfolding of the group, without dialogue, and how they live and work together is just first rate. Not many games replicate the narrative as well, with so much minimalism, as this game amazingly does. By the time it was over, I was suprised to be as emotionally invested as I was. Come for the fun H@x0rz, stay for the deep emotional bond that develops."

The mechanics are clever, the puzzles fun, and the mission locations interesting.  There's a minimal story included that is told mostly through environment, and there are several well-done ""wow"" moments to be had.My only complaint is the duration of the game.  I don't mind short games if they tell the story they need to tell and then stop, but Quadrilateral Cowbow really cries out for more levels and more complex puzzles.  If there was additional content, this would be an easy recommendation.  As it stands, though, I think I can only recommend it to people who are really on-board with the concept.

The story was ingaging for me in a sort of indulgde at your own leassuire kind of way.

Essentially the game is polished as an experience of sorts, rather than just a vanilla game with a typical finish over the top.

Howver I believe as mods start coming out a lot of play time will be added, there's a lot of replayability as the leaderboard serves as a good metric to measure how good you are versus your friends and compared to the world wide standard, and the game runs very well.

The act of actually hacking in a terminal, in game, is incredibly satisfying and flexible as a puzzle mechanics.  I found myself wanting to create the fastest way of navigating through the levels, and seeing doors magically open for you after you perfectly timed your hack really cements the theme of being an ace hacker.  The story is also excellent, told without much text and no voice acting, but still gives you a great sense of character and development.The only thing dissapointing about this game is that there isn't more of it.  It seemed like the puzzles and levels could be expanded and iterated on to do some really cool things.  Fortunately there's good mod support, so I look forward to seeing what the community creates and I'll probably give it a shot myself.

I can only hope they aren't done designing more content because there is so much room for expansion. Admittedly for the price I was disappointed that I could beat the whole game so quickly.Few ideas for the developers:- Create levels that require the use of unique bullet types (rubber, tranquilizer, etc.) with limited quantity of each- Create different guns in different case sizes (pistol miniture case, machine gun or cannon luggage sized bag)- world wide score board not just people on computer- ability to multi-player beat levels (take on one of the roles)- another muti-player idea, create teams and both try to break into same building and steal same end prize. Whoever gets it first wins <x> points. Best of 3 maps- In outerspace you have everything in lowgravity except the player. Maybe add an element of gravity to the player too"
240440,1,0,somanymoviessolitletime,406,189,1,4.0,"August 1, 2016","After finishing Quadrilateral Cowboy I can firmly say that it is great! Although the actual play time was pretty short the pacing made it feel much longer than it really was.As with Blendo's previous games this one is just brimming with charisma and charm; there are lots of tiny nods to previous works and movies that influenced the game.I couldn't help noticing that the game felt really influenced by the anime Cowboy Bebop (and I'm not just saying this cause of my name); Chung had previously said in an interview that the little red bullet boxes that appear in some of his games were taken from the show and it seems like quite a few more references and themes were taken from it. They both have a small band of misfits taking odd jobs and casually going to space. There is also the same mix of cultures in the enviroments that Bebop is full of; and they both have Cowboy in the title!Spoilers from here!The ending felt like it touched on a lot of the key themes from that show. It ends with you reminissing on the life of crime that you lived when younger; it seems like a happy ending but if you look carefully just before the final photgraph that triggers the end credits there are books on hospice care, and because you're the only person in the ending sequence it heavily implies that your partners in crime are probably now very ill or already dead; suggesting that all that fun that was had was only part of the past; in fact it kind of recontextualizes the entire game to from the perspective of older you looking back. In fact the leaderboards urging for a faster time after each heist suggest that you are looking back at the heists you completed during you life and thinking about how much better they could have been run. The reason I think this theme of recognizing that all of that was back in the past is also inspired by Bebop is because that is literally the key themes of Bebop; every character in that show has something from their past that they are either too focused on or trying to run away from.So maybe I'm just crazy and maybe obsessed with an anime, but considering Chung has mentioned that show as an inspiration to earlier works I think it is interesting to look into similarities."
240440,57,0,hattori300,253,47,-1,5.7,"August 1, 2016","This one is a doozy. How do you talk about a game you had a ton of fun playing, but feltcompletely underwhelmed by it?I guess the best way to start is with the stuff that it does well, and it indeed does it incredibly well.So whats the game about? You are part of a 3 man(woman)  crew who takes jobs and contracts of the illegal sort. You are a thief so to speak. A highly efficient thief. Not the kind that hides in the shadows and kills stealthly or parkours around the rooftops, but the kind that hacks security defenses, opens tightly locked doors, and deactivates lasers. Yes, you are a hacker.But where the games excels in this department over other similar premises, like Watchdogs, is in the way that it makes you feel like a hacker.Your biggest asset in this game is the laptop you carry with you and the way the gameplay around it works.You see, you have to manually place the laptop on surfaces and type in the command lines yourself, for example, opening a door will require you to type in door2.open(x), x being the number of seconds it will be open.This might sound tedious and annoying, but I assure it goes a long way to make you feel like a pro doing heists in the fastest time possible. Typing a long line of commands, and seeing the world unfold the way you want it to and reaching your goal perfectly is a great feeling.You then will get new gadgets with each subsequent new heist, stuff like a remote bot you have to connect to a small crtv  and type in the inputs you want it to do, or a turret that you have to pitch and move on your laptop.These are all fun gadgets that give promises and foretellings of how complicated the heists will turn out in the future, with the simple idea of having to manage them all at once being a sign of things to come.And this is where my biggest problem lies with this game. It never comes. Those hard puzzles where you have to take everything you learned so far to task and being able to manage every single gadget so you can get the objective and flee undetected do not exist in this game.Every heist gives you a new idea and mechanic, only for it to be abandoned in the next heist. There is even one point where the game gives you a heist where you need to control all 3 characters simultaniously to achieve the objective, which is great, only to abandon that idea the next heist, by giving every single ability to one character.The only heist where I can say your skills and understanding of the game are truly tested is the phenomenal last level, where you will constantly realize your mistakes and have to restart the level once again to do it just right, and it feels amazing. And then the game ends.My comprehension of how game development works isnt the best, and I understand that this is a one man project. But I expected more from this title, knowing how long it took to be made. There is a Mod section in the menu of the game, and while it makes perfect sense for it to exist, since this seems the kind of puzzle game that put in the hands of talented players could create amazing and incredibly complex levels, looking back at it now that I have finished the game, it just screams ""Lazy"" to me. You need to earn those talented players first, before you ask them to make levels for you.Its odd, because I absolutely love Portal, a game whose puzzles are very easy and the whole game feels like a tutorial, same as this one. Maybe its because Portal carries itself with its pacing and sense of world, and the amazing character of Glados.Which isnt to say that Quadrilateral Cowboy fails in this department. It has such style and aestethic, the kind I absolutely love, and it conveys so much about its characters with just a few short scenes and moments.But unfortunately, it wasnt enough for me. The price it asks is too much, buy this on sale.It feels like the game is struggling between being a narrative experience and a substancial videogame, and while the former is very good, the latter is definitely missing.If you value style over substance, then you might enjoy this very short and sweet experience, because the time I spent with it was very enjoyable. But if like me, you expect a slow increase in difficulty and the game demanding more of a player's skills as it goes along, you will not find it here.Its almost as if the dev of the game is simply giving you the tools to create a better game, and giving you a tutorial for things to come. If those things do come, I will gladly come back and enter this world once again. But if not, what we have for now feels unfinished.Im having Superhot flashbacks all over again. That was a game that also had a great premise, ended very fast, and had an absurd price tag. But at least Superhot had an Endless Mode where you could spend hours in if it was your kind of stuff.Sadly you wont find that kind of extra content here, unless you get into beating the levels again as fast as possible. Thing is, the levels are so easy, there really isnt much space to improve on your score..."

240440,1,0,berengal,567,1,1,5.9,"August 1, 2016","A very artistic game that also has engaging gameplay.I found both the setting and narrative to be very interesting. Some may not find much in the vagueness and lack of explicit exposition, but I quite enjoyed exploring the world and trying to discover what it was about. The world is very clearly different from our own, but it shares enough similarities that it's not completely alien which makes it quite a bit eerie and mysterious.The artstyle is very distinctive; lots of low-polygon shapes and flat colors makes it more of a symbolic rather than realistic style. I feel this symbolic artstyle combines very well with the strange world because the familiar symbols and the unfamiliar setting create an interesting and somewhat unsettling contrast. The textures are also very high quality, even insignificant pieces of paper are readable. Some text is so small that even walking right up to it you can't really read it, you have to zoom in even further for the text to become large enough. This high texture quality makes the world feel very crisp and made exploring it more enjoyable.The gameplay was also good, but it is somewhat lacking in depth. The puzzles were not so hard that they became frustrating, but not too easy either and it felt rewarding to solve the harder missions. I feel like the missions were all well designed in the way they introduced new mechanics and ramped up the difficulty. Some have said the puzzles have a programming element, but that's not really true. There's no conditional logic and very little abstraction, you type commands into a command line and that's it. The lack of depth doesn't show up in the missions themselves, it only become apparent in the game's length. The game can be pretty short if you're decent at puzzle solving and don't take the time to look around you but go straight for the objectives.It took me about 4 hours to finish the game, and I spent a good portion of that time doing other stuff than just solving the puzzles. The length doesn't bother me, I had a great time playing the game and I will probably go back to it to try to improve my time on different missions or try different approaches.I should note that you have the ability to skip every mission if you want to, which I think is a nice feature in case you get stuck on something. There's little narrative exposition in the missions themselves, and you have the ability to explore every world in noclip mode so there's really no penalty to skipping other than missing out on the puzzle itself.All in all I think this is a great game. If you like puzzle games this is good. If you like exploring weird settings with unique art this is good. If you only care exclusively about gameplay and solving hard puzzles the game might too short."

No single mechanic is ever exhausted and QC captures a feeling in a way most games can't. You'll walk away from Quadrilateral Cowboy feeling like a true hacker, even if all security systems in this universe are extremely rudimentary. A few twists and turns here and there keep things fresh and make QC a must-play for fans of indie games. Not without its flaws though, there are definitely plenty of engine issues with Quadrilateral Cowboy.

I did have fun playing it, but I was expecting the game to be longer than 4 hours. Also, the devs spent a lot of their time in the story mechanic other than the level design. Most of the levels are simple, but I like the more complex ones towards the end which make you restart over and over. My face was blank when I realized the game was over. Hopefully there will be a workshop where players can design their own levels(if there is one then I didn't check and I'm too lazy to check).

Its magical and very customizable, which COULD lead to insanely creative ways to solve the games many levels. Which leads us to the problem: there aren't that many levels, and it feels like the levels were created with only one or two solutions in mind. The levels are so simple, and segmented, so it doesn't feel like there is much synergy. You can't really chain things together outside the moments, you can tell, that you were explicitly supposed to; except for a few occations (and in my opinion are the best moments of the game, really, pure joy) here and there.It's like all the effort went into the story and the mechanic, and none into level design. Which is insanely dissapointing, because it would be the best game I've ever played if a little more polish was put into it. My number one example for this, is the two person heist mechanic, where you have two characters who you can sync up with your watches, planning each move carefully, but then its over. Boom, 2 or 3 levels and we never see it again. Essentially the tutorial to use this mechanic is the duration you get to enjoy the mechanic.  Really though, thats how the whole game feels, by the time you have really gotten to use the equipment well, you are done and wont play the game again.You can tell a lot of love was put into this game, and you can see from my playtime I have loved this game, but it leaves so much to be desired. Most of my time was spent seeing if I could unlock ""the rest of the game"", praying it was hidden.If the dev ever announces that they are going to hire a level designer to make a second story, or just a puzzle mode where you play several levels during the at least 25 year gap between the beginning and end, I will recommend the game. For now I don't want to let people get as let down as I was, even if the first 4 hours were amazingly fun."

My only significant complaints are that I wish the whole toolset had been used in more missions once you have access to it, and I wish there had been more  multi team member missions. That said, better to end strong than overstay your welcome.Since the game has built in mod support, there is reason to hope that the community might take that ball and run with it.

240440,0,0,delvan,661,5,1,6.2,"July 30, 2016","Love the environment, and the mish-mash of the setting. The story was presented more in a ""find the lore"" approach rather than being cutscene driven (anyone notice those books on hospice care?), each heist level alternates with a shopping or downtime level that you can either explore or just speed through depending on your interest in that.  There was also some care clearly put into making the world very interactive, though this typically amounts to just picking the item up and moving it around. The sticky-note system lets you leave tips & messages for your friends to see whenever they play through a level, akin to the Talos Principle's graffiti except you can actually type whatever you like on the note.  The notes are also small enough in size that someone worried about potential spoilers can avoid zooming in to look at them.The gameplay itself has all the right tools for a stand-out puzzle game, though most of the levels are largely ""I know I'm supposed to use this device, lets watch for where I use it"".  By the time you're given all the tools at once and aren't being especially corraled, the game is over.  I ended up with 6.2 hours, and I spent some extra time on certain levels playing around with how smoothly & automated I could make things...building long batch files while in the ""Casing"" mode so I could sail through the non-casing mode with good timing and a few blink commands rather than frequently accessing the deck.  If you have several friends who play it, you may get some extra playtime by trying to beat your friend's fastest times on the various heists...at the time I played it, none of my friends had given it a go.I highly recommend playing it if the concept sounds up your alley, but I'd wait for it to go on sale, or wait for the Workshop to add new levels or the like (I'm posting this review just a few days since release, so take that into consideration relative to whenever you're reading this review.

It's not without its flaws, but it's a great time.Basically, QC (because that name is WAY too long) is about being freelance ""hackers"" who steal stuff. Most of the game is an interplay between the real world around you and console commands that you type into your deck (in game computer). The game is set in a strange cyber punk 80's setting. A probably dystopian society and more weirdness around every corner makes the world enjoyable to be in.Now, the gameplay. This sits in a weird space for me. I really like it. The concepts behind it are great and the execution is enjoyable, but the levels never allow the depth that one would expect from a puzzle game. Every level brings in a new ability and each of those levels is focused on that thing. In other words, every level asks you ""do you know how to use this ability?"" but no level ever delves into the interplay between the abilities. I was always expecting to find a big level with complex puzzles necessitating the use of all of the skills I'd learned so far, but that level never came. Plus, the puzzles aren't that difficult. Most of the time I could easily see what needed to done, and succeeding was just a matter of things out.But it's not al bad, because I've enjoyed the experience. The game was definitely fun, just not as fun as it could have been.In the end, QC is unique and definitely worth the time, but it never manages to mature into a serious puzzle game. Is it worth picking up? At $20, I would say that if you really want to check it out, you can pick it up. If you're only interested in it, wait until it's on sale for around $10, because it's definitely worth that price."

Modernist visuals are skillfully blended with the attitudes of cyberpunk to make a universe that is truly fun to play in and examine.You play as one of the members of a three-woman tech contractor firm which specializes in performing high-tech theft. You use a variety of black-market cyber tools to solve puzzles in order to steal whatever you've been paid to. During the breaks between jobs you have the opportunity to learn more about the personalities and histories of the other characters, adding an emotional dimension to the game without using dialogue.Chung has also made an introductory guide for making mod levels for QC to accompany the game and it seems he is planning to update it further to answer questions people are having, which I really appreciate.My main complaint is that it feels far too short. I really kept wanting to be able to see more of QC's world after it ended. But overall I truly enjoyed playing it. The high point of the game, for me, was being tasked with making digital copies of the brains of coma patients in a clinic floating in space."

It is all very beautiful to experience.Half the game is a story that unfolds, and the other half is puzzle solving. The tale is quite moving, and the puzzles are very reasonably difficult, and quite rewarding. If you know Chung’s work, you know what to expect as far as the ‘experience’ or flavor. Otherwise, here is a test to gauge if you will like this game. If two of the three apply to you, then I highly recommend you buy it:1.	You have enjoyed other Blendo games, specifically Thirty Flights of Loving.2.	You enjoy ‘hacking’ or logic puzzle games such as Duskers or to a lesser extent TIS-100.3.	You are a fan of Wes Anderson films, or follow any director (for that matter) that has a very potent flavor or style.I didn’t mention the price tag, because it still remains to be seen how the Workshop and future updates will change the play content. Two days after release Chung added update 001 which added some cool things. Also to note, the cryptic three digits there. Will there be hundreds of small updates over time? Not sure. Mileage will vary, but if you enjoy the game, there is quite a bit to explore. It won’t be difficult to get at least 10 hours out of what is here now. Right now, you can experience the storyline (~5 hours), replay with commentary (~2 hours), and then race the high scores or mess with mods (I’m not sure what kind of hours this will add – likely depends on you).Essentially, you have a variety of technologies to accomplish ‘hacking’ based tasks. The whole thing is played out in 1st person mode, where you solve puzzles by using computer code. The learning curve is nowhere near as steep as others in this genre. In fact, most found the puzzle difficulty underwhelming. I did too, but honestly, it was almost refreshing to be able to finish it without banging my head off the walls for days.While a common complaint is that Quadrilateral Cowboy is too short, I actually may *slightly* have the opposite feeling. Debatably, what made Thirty Flights of Loving so magical is how quick of an experience it was. It packed sooo much in, in so little time. Now, Quadrilateral Cowboy doesn’t wear out its welcome, but I totally understand why the base game length is what it is. Pros:+Beautiful Blendo style that throws you into magically wonderful storytelling like no other game can+Awesome mix of first person and ‘hacking’ or logic puzzles+The details are often in the simplicity of Chung’s storytelling; the feelings can have so much impact with such minimal graphics/sound/tech+Unlike other games in this genre, this title can totally be finished by nearly anyone (instead of just those who have ample experience with logic code)+Updates are still being addedCons:-There are still a few bugs that are being ironed out-Some will see the price-to-hour ratio to be a negative; I still say ‘lets wait and see’, but overall I’m more than happy (I would have spent more, but I’m a huge Blendo fan)-The first half of the story and the end was definitely stronger than the later portion of the game; the portion where you enter ‘team play’ and the bits in outer space were odd and I’m still not sure how it all gels together story-wise-Some of the magic that made Thirty Flights of Loving was in its brevity; Quadrilateral Cowboy does not overstay its welcome, but makes me question how length of game plays a role with such potent storytellingThis was my most anticipated title of 2016. Do I think it is game of the year? Too soon to tell. It certainly lived up to my hype, which says something. If you are an avid indie game fan, this is a must-play. Nobody makes games like Blendo. Period."

Like the rest of the Blendo Games first person catalog, it never wastes your time -- every room of every level is about something, there's no ""filler"" here. Imagine the purity and confidence of Portal 1 (a puzzle game that gracefully knew when to stop) with the visual sensibilities of Hong Kong filmmaker Wong Kar-wai, and you get QuadCow.Many of the negative reviews here are going to complain about how the game doesn't escalate into a hugely over-complicated multi-part multi-agent mission that requires you to engineer 100s of lines of code with 20 different remote devices... but I think it was a wise decision to avoid this same trap that nearly every coding puzzle game falls into.This is not a programming game about complexity -- rather, it's about ingenuity. This is not about designing a giant system with 100 moving parts, and Portal would not have been a better game with 8 portals. Instead, this game is about using the right command at the right time at the right place. (If you know what you're doing, you can complete many of the levels in 30-60 seconds. But the first time you try, it'll take you 15-30 minutes.)Conceptually, QuadCow is about re-imagining the act of coding. Is coding a slow crawl of engineering, or can it be a light and delicate performance, like cold water or a kiss?If you want TIS-100, go play TIS-100. But in this game, YOU ARE A COWBOY, NOT AN ASSEMBLY PROGRAMMER. It's in the gosh-darn title, ok???(Disclosure: I alpha-tested this game and bought the game myself.)"
240440,1,0,Tolsu,360,4,1,6.1,"July 28, 2016","This is overall a very beautiful game and a very unique experience. It's exactly what you would expect from playing Blendo's previous standalone 3D games Gravity Bone and Thirty Flights of Loving. It's longer and grander than both of those, but it shares many of their traits, such as Blendo's unique storytelling methods and his great worldbuilding, using techniques like magic realism and implied plot. The gameplay is more focused in this game than in his others (they didn't have much in terms of puzzles or things like that) and it adds to the game significantly. The hacking mechanics are very well done and it's very fun to use all the gadgets. The only flaws with this game are that the missions are linear puzzles without much replayability (actually not any replayability at all unless you feel like getting more immersed in the gorgeous world or want to go for a better time on the arbitrary leaderboards) and the many crashes experienced during play. Blendo is, however, working progressively and diligently to eliminate bugs and crashes so by time anyone reads this, the crashes will probably be fixed. Overall I feel it was worth the $20, but if you want a longer game (it's about 4 hours long), or expect sandboxey levels ala deus ex and an in-your-face story, then you probably won't enjoy it. This game can be summed up as 30 flights of loving multiplied by 10 with keyboard hacking ala command prompt and a couple neat gadgets (remote controlled robot, autoturret, springboard-type launcher) so if that doesn't sound appealing, don't buy it."
240440,2,0,KrunkSplein,164,20,1,5.3,"July 28, 2016","A fantastic experience, albeit a short one.  While the other reviewers are correct in that the game ends before it truly begins, the core mechanics are solid.  It is clear that the fine folks at Blendo have assembled a fantastic set of building blocks, they simply need to do some more building with them.  As I said, the mechanics are solid.  Using the deck to interact with both items in the level and subsequent tech feels fantastic.  The alarm timers are a nice solution to the problem of giving the user too much direct control - if a door or laser is opened for more than a (visibly posted) length of time, an alarm sounds.  This prevents the user from simply holding doors open indefinitely and lends itself also to some of the more interesting timing puzzles.In short, while I hope more content is forthcoming, I consider Quadrilateral Cowboy as it stands worthy of the price of admission."

240440,408,14,gnolam,338,9,-1,4.6,"July 27, 2016","This game had the potential to be great, but never realizes that potential.I kept wondering when I would leave the tutorial and get to the actual game - and 4 hours later it was over.Quadrilateral Cowboy's biggest problem is that it refuses to combine its different puzzle types into a sum greater than its parts, choosing instead to keep them frustratingly discrete. Each map introduces a new puzzle type, usually along with a new item, which is then used as the main puzzle on that map. Then you'll move on to a new puzzle type - usually with enough hand-holding that you never really need to think about the solution. Solve a puzzle once and you've solved it forever: the puzzles don't evolve, they don't get any more difficult, they never get revisited with a different toolset. My greatest difficulty in the game was in fact figuring out where I was supposed to go next and not how to solve each puzzle.(That and the bugs, which forced me to quit and restart the game again and again as game objects glitched out and became impossible to interact with.)The really frustrating thing about this is that, as I said at the beginning, it had the potential to be great. Each individual puzzle element is clever, creative, and hints at the ingenious puzzles it could be used for - but never is.Stylistically speaking, it is also one of the most confused games I have ever seen: ""Let's do an early '80s setting! No, let's do a William Gibson-style cyberpunk setting! No, let's do steampunk!"". It has the feel of someone in the 30th century being asked to portray hacker life in the late 20th century without any research - and not in a charming way. The same goes for the graphics, which mix extreme minimalism with fancier effects in a way that feels less like a deliberate design choice than a way to save money on artists.A 4-hour game for 20 bucks is always hard to recommend. For a disappointing 4 hours, it's impossible. For now, save your money."

If you had asked me a day or so ago what my favourite puzzle game was; I would tell you the portal series. Now, it would be Quadrilateral Cowboy. no question.The story was simplistic, yet beautiful and oddly touching. I felt myself grow attached to my group of friends,  though a single word was never spoken. The ""Hacking"" mechanics were easy to use, and even easier to learn. Unlike a majority of well known hacking games, you actually type commands, rather than 'click' them. Don't expect these commands to come in handy in real life, but in the context of the game it felt empowering and, well, awesome.  The gadgets were simply F***ing awesome, and some of the 'abilities' you pick up later on are pretty cool too. My only complaint was that the game ended feeling too short, even though in truth I had played for 7 hours. I suppose that is the hall mark of fun, though. Time flies when you're having it. The technology had a retro feel to it, which was, to put it simply, delicious.

Sure, the cube headed heist team is back, but the mechanics themselves are brilliant and satisfying, the puzzles are exactly that Portal-esque layering of teaching you different techniques and allowing you lightbulb moments.Not sure what my final time ended up being. ~5 hours, I think, and I'll likely play it again to improve a few of those level scores and read more of those hilarious object labels.Brendon, if you read this, thank you."

If you want to compare it to something, think Thief and Uplink meshed together.As with all Chung's games, it's got a quirky, simplistic aesthetic that lends more focus to the narrative than the environments. The game is set during a retro-futuristic 1980 with airships, space elevators and oversized ventilation shafts.The basic gameplay consists of lugging around a chunky Osbornesque ""portable"" computer and using it to hack into security systems to open doors and windows, turn off laser grids and cameras, and so on. The computer lets you set up sequences of commands to create small scripts, optimally letting you simply walk through a building while doors and alarms toggle around you. I'd loved if this concept had been explored more, since only the last mission starts to approach the complexity I expected. The most complex thing you do consists of toggling four lasers after eachother with the little walking robot.I chalk this down to the game being too short. Chung's games tend to go in the ""short and sweet"" category, and narratively Quadrilateral Cowboy works perfectly in its three-to-four hour playtime. Mechanically, I was left wanting more.The story is fun, the characters are quirky and characterful (despite not saying anything), the gadgets have great potential that isn't fully realized, and there's apparently mod support out of the gate (makes sense considering the engine is open-source).I tihnk the mods might make this game really great.

Chung's games have always been about packing the world with detail and secrets and story and meaning, and QC sort of brings that out mechanically too - you need to understand the environment to find solutions, and that means you end up paying attention to all the small touches and flourishes in each world.Timings and leaderboards sort of put an unnecessary pressure on gameplay, and it can make it tempting to rush in and power through to the best solution. I can't see a way to turn them off, but I recommend just sort of breezing through it on your first run and not worrying about optimality.

It’s a straight up puzzle solving game with STAGES.Then it's a command-via-typing / exploration style game.For those wondering: I'd say it's 50/50 with typing and exploring - Some more than others at times.Instead of interacting with things point blank, you enter commands on your ""mobile"" terminal, control robots, fire weapons, use jump pads and more! Feels like pieces of other titles meshed together with a unique art style in the process of being perfected by Blendo. After the first portion of the solo play it splits into a multi-mode where you case, engineer and grease your way through stages. The trick being the actions you do in time affect the next mode you play. It's a fun twist and change to the first portion.Without ruining too much of the puzzle aspect of the game, the stages have been very thought out and the more items you unlock, the harder things get.Be prepared to restart stages to achieve the fastest times without penalties.Say hello to Chu Chu the black-market cat."

Its art stile with typical of this dev but you don't know them, the best mainstream comparison is Jazzpunk, however that game's humorous tone is missing. The first mission really sets up its vibe, Debussy's Clair de Lune playing softly in the background, accented with the slight crackle of old vinyl, while you make you way through a train, opening windows and doors with your little switching device. everything has a retro aesthetic, and this game could run on a potato. 20 dollars is a very solid asking price, thanks to solid gameplay and style, and with workshop support, the amount of content is very large."

I added it to my wish list years ago because I loved Gravity Bone and Thirty Flights Of Loving, but it took a long time for me to get around to buying it. It's not quite as good as those two games, but it is much longer, which is nice. You play a criminal who plans out heists for your criminal buddies. Over the course of the game you unlock more and more zany gadgets to crack ever-more-elaborate security measures. The heists are absurd and hilarious, and the scenes between them are the highlight of the game. Unfortunately toward the end of the game the heists start becoming more timing-based, so you're likely to screw them up and then have to replay several times over (you can't save mid-heist), which ruins the pacing of the story. Still, it is a really cool story and the minor frustration toward the end is worth it for the overall experience."

240440,3,0,76561198013450952,285,31,-1,6.2,"October 13, 2020","Quadrilateral Cowboy is an idea which sounds good on paper, but in reality, doesn’t translate well to the video game format. It has lots of cool ideas but doesn’t really know how to build upon them or assimilate them all into a unified whole. Instead, for the most part, they seem to be used in isolation from one another, which is a wasted opportunity and doesn’t really make for a satisfying experience. Then there’s the inherent problem that constantly typing commands is, you know… not exactly fun no matter how it’s presented! Especially so when you’re constantly referring back to your command list because you can’t possibly remember them all…Ultimately, the real problem with the game is that the developers had a cool idea (i.e., heists and hacking) but no fun gameplay mechanic with which to accommodate it - the exact opposite of how good game design should be. It feels more like a learning tool quickly cobbled together by a programming teacher as a “fun” and interactive means for his students to learn. Ironically, though, the game doesn’t actually explain its mechanics very well at all, making learning quite difficult. There’s nothing wrong with a puzzle game being difficult because of its puzzles, but when it’s due to incompetent tutorials which leave the player unsure of how to use the many tools at their disposal, it becomes less forgivable.Lastly, the game is also very buggy and glitchy; one of the worst games I’ve played for years in this regard, in fact. So, quite a few negatives there. The game does have its moments, but these are few and far between and the lasting impression of Quadrilateral Cowboy is one of frustration and boredom."

240440,5,0,76561197960446959,590,23,1,9.9,"May 15, 2020","""Quadrilateral Cowboy"" has a very solid core game mechanic, upon which numerous additional mechanics are placed. It's a puzzle game at its heart, but it's also a platformer, a coding exercise, and much more.But you can ignore nearly all of that. Every level is entirely skippable if you're not enjoying yourself, with no punishment for pushing the ""not for me"" button. The thing that makes QC special is the world, the characters, and the bizarre experience of having a deliberately low-fi aesthetic produce better environmental storytelling than any Bethesda game. The game levels are good: the interactive ""cutscenes"" that lie between them are masterful.Explore every nook and cranny of these spaces and you will find a broad story composed of dozens of smaller, more personal ones. Pay attention to details because nothing will be spelled out for you."

It's got a sort of whacky vibe you'll find in games like The Norwood Suite and Jazzpunk, but this is a puzzle game. You use a computer (called a deck in the game) and via the deck and a series of other cool gadgets you pick up along the way you figure out how the correct series of commands to complete the mission. Meanwhile, without a word being spoken, a very light story of friendship unfolds. The puzzles are fun and the world Blendo Games has created is VERY cool. My only ""complaints"" would be:1) The game is about 5-6 hours long. I certainly would have done more! The final mission really had me scratching my head for a solution. That being said, I have not explored all the mods available for the game, which seem to include a number of additional fan-made missions.2) A handful of times I got frustrated when I'd get almost all the way to the end of a mission and then something unexpected would go wrong, which means you have to do the entire mission again. This usually isn't an issue, but some of the late game puzzles take a bit of set up to execute, and having to do it over and over can feel a little tedious."

Most missions require looking at a screen within a screen which makes it hard to see important details.- Tons of bugs and jank.  Had to restart the game several times because it would get stuck in strange unplayable states.  Somehow despite the blocky minimalist aesthetic this game made my 1080 Ti drop frames worse than DOOM or any modern AAA game.- There's really only about 5-6 hours of gameplay here.

It is effectively a Heist game with a ""hacking"" aesthetic. The game design is quite simple, the character models are the most basic I've seen since DK Mode in Goldeneye 64 but it works amazingly well. Every level is highly detailed, almost every object can be interacted with. The puzzles you solve while trying to complete the levels are quite interesting and can sometimes be challenging for precision. If you enjoyed the overall style of Zombie Atom Smasher and if you have fond memories of DOS prompt and writing batch files then I would recommend this game to you.- The only downside I can fault is the length of the game with only 10 levels which makes it incredibly short."

240440,3,0,chaoseed,270,44,1,6.2,"February 21, 2020","Quadrilateral Cowboy is a really interesting and cool game. It's billed as a 'hacking' game, but I would call that a misnomer; it's more like an infiltration and heist puzzle game. (Of course, one might say that infiltration is ""hacking a location""? But while you do type a few console commands, that part of the game is very simple.)Gameplay is, basically, performing a series of heists. (Technically the conceit is that you're ""planning"" the heists, but whatever.) You have to explore the levels and figure out what switches to press, or what commands to send to dataports in order to get to your objective. As you go through the game, you get introduced to more and more tools, and things can ultimately get rather complex. The gameplay is fascinating, and the really good thing is that it doesn't require much in the way of reflexes or manual dexterity. (I did have to play through the last level about half a dozen times, but it didn't get too frustrating.)Another really great thing about Quadrilateral Cowboy is its aesthetic. It's billed as ""twentieth-century cyberpunk"", and it seems to take place in an alternate world where twentieth-century technology is put to information age uses. This is a world where you can run heists on a cable car speeding through the night, where a space elevator has a ""Please return breathing equipment here"" door, where your character uses a ""Vinylman"" portable record player with headphones. It's fascinating and charming.Speaking of charming, one really interesting feature of the game is the cutscenes between the levels. They're understated vignettes that give you glimpses into the characters' lives. I don't want to spoil much, but even though these scenes were short, I really enjoyed them.All in all, I enjoyed my time with Quadrilateral Cowboy."

As it stands, 5/10. maybe 5.5 but it's alright.  You have a glimpse at the future, where you look through old pictures at the friends who've been present in the game just over.

The map design was nice, lots of fun little details, sometimes interactive, if you want to make the effort to see little details.

I haven't even finished it yet but I want to recommend it already. I guess it took me a while because it advertises itself as a hacking game, which in games means ""play stupid mini games in terminal windows"".  It's just not a very informative classification. What this is in fact is a unique game that I'll just call a heist planner game. While stealth games focus on, well, stealth and improvisation -- the execution part of a heist -- this one focus on the planning aspect of it. This counterpoint with stealth games is pretty weak though, it still plays like a stealth game without sneaking. You have full knowledge of the place, you can noclip and fly around, and complete the heist in the simulator. It's all about navigating the environment and using your computer to open doors, turn off lasers, control turrets etc. You can concatenate commands to perform complex actions. Some actions are timed, like for example, some door that triggers an alarm after 3 seconds opened. Although I am having a great time with this game, it is a game with a very limited audience and rough around the edges, so I am finding the price tag a bit high. As I said, I am enjoying it so to me it's worth it, but it's a risky acquisition. I hope there are user made levels because this game would benefit tremendously from that.

The game has some gameplay bugs, however they are not game breaking and do not disrupt the experience. This game reminds me of other games like Shenzen I/O, but this one takes a different approach to this type of game. While coding and CMD control is part of the gameplay, it is not the only focus of it. This game has a story, interesting map and world design and a general feel, that i haven't seen other tech games implement before. I would recommend this game to anyone interested in code, heists and a good story behind the game. The following part of the review is a bug report for the developers of the game, it contains spoilers and is not relevant to the review: On the last level of the game, I experienced what seems to be a glitch in the casing mode. When flying through the ducts, where you are supposed to place a weever drone and make it jump a small gap to connect to 2 different datajacks, my character tripped the alarm above me. After repeating this glitch it seems like the viewbox of the casing mode is located in the feet of the body, making it hard to navigate the duct below the lasers. To repeat the bug, get into casing mode on the Abby YoYo Elevator job (last mission), get into the ducts below the room where the floor is covered with lasers and fly around."

First of all the game is a bit short, sure its got a lot of levels but they all feel like they are just teaching you. There isn't much actual game. This is mainly because the game never combines the things you learn. I loved to use the weevil but you only get to use it 3 or so times, and after that it becomes useless. I like the levels as they are, but there should more that are more open. like one that gives you a choice between weevil crawlspace and suitcase gun button tricks. Second the game gets changed to often, at first it changes a little and i like what comes from those changes, but about halfway in the game removes the solo and does this, odd to person heist, but you control both. And that only happens for two levels before its back to one person.To make a long story short, its a good game but it has wasted potential. Also its a bit overpriced."

I didn't know coming into it too much other than there was a retro-futuristic style hacking element and puzzle solving.  But I quickly found myself pretty addicted to finishing the next challenge.  First off, the Pros:1. I really liked the atmosphere of the game.  There were lots of throwbacks to older technologies (as a die-hard Amiga fan, I absolutely loved that there was a Guru meditation error on one of the screens).  The phonograph style music combined with Cyberpunk living ala Bladerunner made for a really cool combination.  The fact that the game is based around low-polygon graphics in no way hampers the visual feeling I got when playing.2. The puzzles were (for the most part), fun and well designed.  There were a few times when I was a bit frustrated over the level of precision necessary for a puzzle, but that was rare.  I liked the hacking aspects, and when multiple steps/blink control was introduced, it added a slight programmatic element that made it even better (I wish this was explored more, but that's okay).3.  The cut scenes between levels were a fun, often funny diversion as well.  Loved the cat-run black market (speaking of which, providing a new upgrade each level made progressing fun as well).  Cons:1. The base game is definitely on the short and easy side.  There are 10 levels, but most of the early ones don't take particularly long to solve.2.  The game does feel a bit rough around the edges, especially with physics/collision detection stuff.  There were a few bugs I ran into it (sometimes when accessing the terminal, I'd start breathing heavily like a window into space just broke, even though it didn't.  Sometimes I'd be pushed to the left in canvas mode with no way to move.  Some other weird movement related things).  Not really a show stopper by any means, but when you're working on the same puzzle for a while, it can get irritating for something to screw up.Other than that, I overall liked the game, and definitely suggest it to anyone who likes physics puzzle solving ala Portal (or anyone who is into retrocomputing/hacking styled games).  Glad I finally got a chance to play it!"

240440,61,0,kemo__,012,307,1,4.1,"November 6, 2019","Swanky but Janky Quadrilateral Cowboy is a cyberpunk heist game developed by Blendo Games. It’s described as a hacking game, but that’s not really accurate as you just type in basic lines of code. Anyway, you play as a nameless (I think?) character who as part of a three-person crew performs heists. Over the course of ten jobs you’ll steal a wide variety of things ranging from documents to safes. Positives: The aesthetic here is awesome. I love how chunky everything is, I love the depressing dystopic world and it all works so well together.There are some cool gadgets that you unlock over the course of the game that are fun to play with, including a little robot weevil and a briefcase that deploys into a turret.The level design is pretty cool, they’re all well varied and fun to explore. Later in the game you’re able to use the other two members of your crew, which was pretty fun. They both have unique skills/abilities and the way the game handles using two characters was neat. The music is awesome. Neutral: The levels are all linear and there’s really only one way to complete them. It made it feel more like a puzzle game than a heist game. I don’t necessarily think it’s bad as a result, but I was a bit disappointed that there wasn’t much room to experiment or do your own thing. Negatives:This game is super janky. Some jank can be kind of charming, but here the jankiness can get in the way of playing the game at times. For example, you can climb up ledges, but because of the way that works it can be difficult to do in closed spaces and the way it’s animated is really awkward. The jank really gets in the way when you have to do things involving specific timings, I’ve found the last level so frustrating for this reason, I’ve given up on finishing it. The majority of the levels feel like they’re just tutorials for the gadget you just unlocked. Each heist has three parts, so I could understand the first part feeling like a tutorial, but with all three feeling like a tutorial you just end up with a game that doesn’t feel very challenging. The last level is the only one that really feels like you’re on your own, but by then it’s obviously a little too late. As far as I could tell, there wasn't really a narrative here.Verdict: Its puzzle-y heists are enjoyable, but the game feels like one long tutorial and is too janky for its own good. I would say it’s worth picking up on sale, but only if you’re really into weird indie stuff. If you found this review helpful, please consider following my curator page: Kemo's Corner."

Do not let the reliance on the tech scare you away, it really is more about cramming your ideas into a given format.  If you're in to the idea of planning a heist and love games that require some planning, this is for you.The story is both light and heavy, at the same time.  A glimpse into a section of life for a group of friends, how they achieved something great, and the joy that nostalgia can bring.I question the $20 price point given the content length, but when on sale for $10'ish, I highly recommend."

240440,1,0,senorroboto,685,33,1,17.5,"November 1, 2019","One of the most satisfying gaming experiences I've ever had. Blendo understands how to apply cinema editing techniques to games without interfering with interactivity, their use of short scenes and cuts punches the story home and provides emotional beats. It also creates a realized world without requiring a 100-person dev team. Though the world is small physically it is full of details for those who like to look around and pick everything up too.This is a cyberpunk hacking game that understands that if physical violence is required then things have gone to hell. This game is about terminals and scripts, it is about planning and executing that plan. It is a stealth game that is not about waiting for guards to walk around. It's about being ride-or-die for the people you love.Recommend if you enjoy: Zachtronics games (SpaceChem, Magnum Opus), Portal 1/2, Hitman, PUBG, Metal Gear Solid series, Wolfenstein reboots, movies in general"

It starts out simple with just quick jacking in and activating pre-placed commands but before long you'll be timing gun shots to your movement and activating your robot buddy with a blink of your eye. Literally.The game takes a light touch to presenting a story but there definitely is one there if you're willing to look. I like the way the developer makes the story opt in which feels like it rewards you for keeping your mind and eye open to any info.

240440,1,0,76561198092045447,293,34,1,7.5,"August 11, 2019","Quadrilateral Cowboy is a great game. You have so many tools at your disposal, and the game itself is really quite immersive from the cyberdesk you can literally deploy anywhere, to the satisfying clacking of the keys as you plan out how you'll complete your objectives, because in most cases, you won't have a lot of time to act. You have a three second window to work with when it comes to disabling lasers or opening windows. I love the amount of tools you can work with, my personal favorite being the portable ""weevil"" drone you control via commands in the terminal, while your only method of FPV are two CRT monitors you'll deploy right next to your computer. It's these moments that are enjoyable. Plopping down your equipment wherever you please and tackling your objective from afar. I think I've seen a few comments comparing this game to Watch Dogs, and you know what? This is what I wish Watch Dogs was. But..Well..It's kind of just casual fodder, anyway.It's such a satisfying feeling to breach a level, figure out the precise pattern to navigate through laser1 and laser 2, while having the door open with a delayed command. However, I share everyone else's sentiment that the game is too short, and there are tools you acquire that just don't feel like they're used enough. I'm conflicted about this, though. Because I don't want to pin this on Blendo Games and take points away from them, but on the other hand, it's a $20 game and it just needs a bit more meat on its bones. Maybe just a suggestion then, if ever they make a second game. Because this doesn't affect how I feel about Quadrilateral Cowboy. I think it's more of a testament of how much fun I had, and how great this game really is. The level editor could've added a lot more replayability...Too bad no one uses it, though. I mean, there's like 8 items in total on the Steam workshop? Come on. A level editor is perfect for this kind of game. That is just unfair."

If you expected programming in this there is little to none, more using the shell and the most complex scripting being piping to chain commands together.  I wish the game was longer, and some of the later missions to themselves be longer instead of each one adding some new mechanic and only having one objective.

It has the usual Bendo charm to it but fleshes it out more into a 3 to 5 hour experience rather than just their usual 30 or so minutes. I think the art style works for what it is, I played Gravity Bone and Thirty Flights of Loving before this and thought the style was already pretty good for it's 70s esque aesthetic, but it does feel weird to see certain elements that weren't in those two, such as the more cyberpunk elements, but I quickly got used to them. My favorite parts were the puzzles and how logical yet incredibly simple they could be once you figure it all out and understand the coding language for each of your tools, and looking at a guide after finishing the game seemed to give off the sense that there are multiple solutions to each puzzle, so that was pretty neat to figure out. However, this game isn't without its faults, I think the puzzles and in fact the entire game itself ends way too soon, where just as soon as you get to a point where things pick up, the game ends, and its a shame as I felt there was a little more you can do, though I still haven't tried out any mod levels so that might satiate my fix for that.

The game is flawed and lacks polish- I died or got stuck occasionally when I got thrown through a wall, the game crashed to desktop multiple times around the midway point (not too much of an issue as the game autosaves after every level but still annoying), and the last level is an incredibly steep difficulty spike compared to the rest of the game. Despite all this, the core mechanics are well thought out and implemented, getting you to really feel like you're a super spy. The game's ambiance is also fantastic, painting a picture of a distopian, retrofuturistic 1980 that draws heavily on steampunk aesthetics and early 20th century science fiction.

240440,2,0,76561198063567228,219,4,1,4.9,"April 29, 2019","Quadrilateral Cowboy is one of those rare games where you can feel the heart the creator put into it. The game is flawed and lacks polish- I died or got stuck occasionally when I got thrown through a wall, the game crashed to desktop multiple times around the midway point (not too much of an issue as the game autosaves after every level but still annoying), and the last level is an incredibly steep difficulty spike compared to the rest of the game. Despite all this, the core mechanics are well thought out and implemented, getting you to really feel like you're a super spy. The game's ambiance is also fantastic, painting a picture of a distopian, retrofuturistic 1980 that draws heavily on steampunk aesthetics and early 20th century science fiction. Quadrilateral Cowboy is a very human experience that happens to have a reasonably good puzzle game attached to in- while I probably wouldn't buy it for the full price 20$, this would be at the top of my list of games to get while on sale"

But, give me a twist on it and add in a heist element with a cyberpunk bent and add some character and you've got a puzzle game fan. I've played a lot of great ""hacking"" games, this is definitely in my top 5. Thanks to Blendo games for making an exceedingly charming, fun, and engaging game!"
