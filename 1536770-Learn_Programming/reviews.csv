Its more of a interactive textbook but I found it useful. I am trying to get a job as a programmer so I am exploring many different resources. This one definitely makes you think and that is a good thing. I feel there is room for improvement and I would love to see more of these types of ""games"". I see a lot of potential in this and I feel it could be expanded much further. One thing people need to understand is that is only a resource for learning Python. When you finish it you will most likely still not really know what you are doing but it will edge you in the right direction and allow you to piece things together easier. Once finished you will most likely be able to design a very simple program but to get to a actual payable level you are going to need more then just this and a ton of practice. I do recommend this for beginner programmers and or anyone who has not tried Python before. I have taken classes in other languages and worked with them for a few years but had never worked with Python so I found it interesting. Overall I think its worth the money. Investing in yourself is never a bad idea especially for this price."

They say they'll teach you Python but as it seems, they can't write a simple thing right in real Python program.For those who wonder why this is a ""dumb"" error illustrating the skill of the coder: in any programming language, when dealing with Internet connection or any third-party services which aren't in your full control (such as steamworks API which can be updated or changed anytime), you always assume connection problems and other issues, and always implement failsafes so the program won't just crash when something change outside of the program. If it's a non-critical thing, like unstable internet - just disable online features in case of disconnect. If it's critical, stop the program safely whatever it means in a particular case and inform the user of the issue.Search for books about the clean code."

Major props to the dev for this--education is hard enough, but making such an interactive educational game centered around Python made in Python is incredible to me! If the dev makes any more games for this series, I'd buy them 5x the price in a heartbeat--already I've put just over an hour and going at this rate, I'd expect to put more than 10x this amount into it. It's good content!I think if there was any constructive criticism I could give, it'd simply be: 1) I'd love to see some music in this. I've had Virtual Cottage on in the background, so it's not a big deal to me.2) If there were more exercises in between lessons/parts of chapters, as well as an additional exercise section, this could easily be one of my favorite hidden gems of the year (it may already be!)Once again, good job, Dev, and I hope things go well! :)"

For free you can learn from many other sources such as Khan Academy, Youtube, replit, and more. That's not to say this program doesn't have a place in the learning field, it does provide useful information on the wording and fundamentals, however, what i find stopping me most of the time from getting the most out of this are the quizzes. There are no multiple choice or hints, you just have to know the answer or you cannot proceed, at all. For someone brand new to Python i find this very discouraging and not helpful at all. Hopefully down the line we can see some additions like more examples and quiz aids, but for now, I think you can get a much better learning experience elsewhere."

Why not have a common long term project a student is working on throughout the whole book (e.g. a number guessing game), instead of asking the student what will the following program print: ""a = 11, b = 11*2, c = a*b - c**2, result = a*b + (c- 2*c)"" ... Sigh, I don't want to do math, I want to learn how to code, who cares what the program will print!In my 4 years of professional teaching experience, I found that people have more fun learning by actually working on problems, thus the above mentioned idea that the textbook teaches a student basics of coding by giving them small problems, and then expanding on them which results in a finished game at the end of the book.Number guessing game is a really neat project idea because it teaches all the basics one needs to learn how to code.You first start with variables and printing:number = 0print(number)Then you teach them strings and input: number = int(input(""Enter a number: ""))print(""You have entered "" + str(number))Then you teach branching:random_number = rand_int(0, 100)print(""I have imagined a number! You wanna play a guessing game?"")guess = int(input(""Enter a number and I will tell you if you are close!""))if (guess < number)    print(""The number I imagined is higher!"")elif (guess > number)    print(""The number I imagined is lower!"")else    print(""You guessed the number!"")Then you teach how to make a game loop until the player has guessed the number. Since there are number of ways how to do it I won't write any code.Then you teach them how to check for input, because if the user inputs a string when we ask them to input a number the game will crash, etc.From my experience, this approach is really fun for the students, especially kids, and it also helps them practice being creative and doesn't focus only on rote exercises.That being said, I would recommend ""Learn Programming: Python"" to a college student or older, who is basically looking for an interactive textbook."
