The questions tended to be all multiple choice or fill in what you think the code would output, which I felt did not test knowledge well compared to other interactive coding tutorials (especially when no feedback was given aside from right or wrong). Overall, I felt a need to supplement what I read in Learning Programming: Python with outside resources, and did not feel that it reinforced what was taught well.

I highly recommend this.  The explanations are clear, and simplified, skipping the unnecessary and generally confusing stuff that confuses those like me who lack that 'mathematical brain.'People mention the Anti-Virus false positive, which isn't great to see but the dev has addressed this as a known issue that AVs have with Python.  Check out the Github page for this project.  It's save!","I like the concept of the game (note: it's for beginners). As the code is open source, I can even learn more by analysing how the game was created. One point of improvement could be to include a bit more exercises.","Rate it highly, but the program does not respect my eyes.","Pretty fun way to learn Python.","Well written intro to general programming ideas. Nice python den.Next level class, or interactive python cookbook would be great to see.","I really liked this game as it works perfectly with my current school curriculum, but i am a bit skeptical with the false positive my AV keeps alerting me to. I saw the comment another user made about getting this (Trojan:Win32\/Wacatac.D1!ml) trigger, but I am getting a much different one, labeled this (Trojan:Win32\/Woreflint.A!cl) as well. Hopefully this issue gets rectified through microsoft as well, i really was enjoying this.","Sometimes it opens and some other times it doesnt.

Why not have a common long term project a student is working on throughout the whole book (e.g. a number guessing game), instead of asking the student what will the following program print: \"a = 11, b = 11*2, c = a*b - c**2, result = a*b + (c- 2*c)\" ... Sigh, I don't want to do math, I want to learn how to code, who cares what the program will print!In my 4 years of professional teaching experience, I found that people have more fun learning by actually working on problems, thus the above mentioned idea that the textbook teaches a student basics of coding by giving them small problems, and then expanding on them which results in a finished game at the end of the book.Number guessing game is a really neat project idea because it teaches all the basics one needs to learn how to code.You first start with variables and printing:number = 0print(number)Then you teach them strings and input: number = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))print(\"You have entered \" + str(number))Then you teach branching:random_number = rand_int(0, 100)print(\"I have imagined a number! You wanna play a guessing game?\")guess = int(input(\"Enter a number and I will tell you if you are close!\"))if (guess < number)    print(\"The number I imagined is higher!\")elif (guess > number)    print(\"The number I imagined is lower!\")else    print(\"You guessed the number!\")Then you teach how to make a game loop until the player has guessed the number. Since there are number of ways how to do it I won't write any code.Then you teach them how to check for input, because if the user inputs a string when we ask them to input a number the game will crash, etc.From my experience, this approach is really fun for the students, especially kids, and it also helps them practice being creative and doesn't focus only on rote exercises.That being said, I would recommend \"Learn Programming: Python\" to a college student or older, who is basically looking for an interactive textbook."],["As someone trying to learn and implement python into my work. This is an awful learning tool and has hands down been the worst tool I've tried to try and learn python.I thought it would be fun trying to learn via a \"game\". It is anything but ... it is a text book with multiple choice quizzes that don't really help towards fundamentally understanding what is attempting to be taught."],["So I've got minimal coding knowledge going into this, and even before completing the first chapter (out of 10+!), I've only had a good time!I highly, highly recommend this to anyone looking for basic\/intro programming knowledge, because for US $3, there's no better education that I have found than this. Major props to the dev for this--education is hard enough, but making such an interactive educational game centered around Python made in Python is incredible to me! If the dev makes any more games for this series, I'd buy them 5x the price in a heartbeat--already I've put just over an hour and going at this rate, I'd expect to put more than 10x this amount into it. It's good content!I think if there was any constructive criticism I could give, it'd simply be: 1) I'd love to see some music in this. I've had Virtual Cottage on in the background, so it's not a big deal to me.2) If there were more exercises in between lessons\/parts of chapters, as well as an additional exercise section, this could easily be one of my favorite hidden gems of the year (it may already be!)Once again, good job, Dev, and I hope things go well! :)","As someone who's new to the coding world, I cannot really recommend this as a starting point. For free you can learn from many other sources such as Khan Academy, Youtube, replit, and more. That's not to say this program doesn't have a place in the learning field, it does provide useful information on the wording and fundamentals, however, what i find stopping me most of the time from getting the most out of this are the quizzes. There are no multiple choice or hints, you just have to know the answer or you cannot proceed, at all. For someone brand new to Python i find this very discouraging and not helpful at all. Hopefully down the line we can see some additions like more examples and quiz aids, but for now, I think you can get a much better learning experience elsewhere."],["I did it, for a few minutes, and now i know python, thanks guys from san fran!"],["Exercises can not be skipped. Answers are also not provided to someone at the end of their rope. To someone new to Python they will go through the exercises and eventually reach one they can not answer. Not answering the question will not allow them to move on. A solution should be something like question is asked and if the student gets it wrong 5 times in a row. The answer should be provided. Why? Because if you are a total noob which I assume this game was made for \"This game assumes absolutely zero prerequisite background.,\" you will eventually get stuck no matter how much you paid attention to the lessons.","Decent tool to help learn python"],["great resource! nicely put together, explained in simple terms."],["A very simply designed walk through of coding in python language. Super cool stuff! Thanks devs!"],["Game requires Internet connection and doesn't work in autonomous modeWhen online, the game works fine, but when I go offline in Steam, the following error appears for less than a second and then CTD:Traceback (most recent call last):\tFile \"game.py\", line 16, in <module>\tFile \"steamworks\\__init__.py\", line 152, in initializesteamworks.exceptions.SteamConnectionException: Not logged on or connection to Steam client could not be established[9408] Failed to execute script gameI don't even want to write to the author and babysit such a dumb errors. They say they'll teach you Python but as it seems, they can't write a simple thing right in real Python program.For those who wonder why this is a \"dumb\" error illustrating the skill of the coder: in any programming language, when dealing with Internet connection or any third-party services which aren't in your full control (such as steamworks API which can be updated or changed anytime), you always assume connection problems and other issues, and always implement failsafes so the program won't just crash when something change outside of the program. If it's a non-critical thing, like unstable internet - just disable online features in case of disconnect. If it's critical, stop the program safely whatever it means in a particular case and inform the user of the issue.Search for books about the clean code."],["Fun tool for getting started"],["Really good tool to learn the basics of programming using Python.  I just finished Chapter 1 and I like the challenge questions that are given that you must answer correctly to proceed.  :D  My antivirus did flag a file as suspicious after I ran the game the first time.  At first it didn't run but after allowing that flagged file then it ran perfectly.  Really good tutorial so far.  Will update after finishing entire game.  Thanks Devs!"],["game seems to install Uwamson Trojan or is it just me?will change my review if Im wrong.Update. This is apparently a false positive."],["I am not necessarily a beginner to programming but this is a decent educational \"game\". Its more of a interactive textbook but I found it useful. I am trying to get a job as a programmer so I am exploring many different resources. This one definitely makes you think and that is a good thing. I feel there is room for improvement and I would love to see more of these types of \"games\". I see a lot of potential in this and I feel it could be expanded much further. One thing people need to understand is that is only a resource for learning Python. When you finish it you will most likely still not really know what you are doing but it will edge you in the right direction and allow you to piece things together easier. Once finished you will most likely be able to design a very simple program but to get to a actual payable level you are going to need more then just this and a ton of practice. I do recommend this for beginner programmers and or anyone who has not tried Python before. I have taken classes in other languages and worked with them for a few years but had never worked with Python so I found it interesting. Overall I think its worth the money. Investing in yourself is never a bad idea especially for this price."]]}
