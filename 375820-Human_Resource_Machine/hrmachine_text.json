The game lacks replayability but I've had a good 3 days of fun with it and although I've never programmed before I felt like I have achieved something by beating almost every level. The last 2 and some of the side levels were above my skills but most of them were well balanced. Graphics and Sound design were awesome, the little story line was pleasant but lacking in the end, I would have hoped for some kind of funny conlcusion which didn't happen.","Super fun game, if you like programming games like Manufactoria, Spacechem or TIS100. I guess it could be a good introduction to programming too as it is very much like coding in a low level language.","The game is really different from anything else I have played. I makes you feel really smart when you complete it. I am on the last group of levels and I have not googled or looked up anything yet. After I have gotten the hang of it, it is almost like my mind is geared for it. The two challenges for each level are kinda stupid, because they even give you a warning, sometimes you can't complete both at the same time. So that is kinda frusterating. I wish instead of the challenges there was a leaderboard ranking, although people would just cheat and google there way to the top of the leaderboards, so I don't know. I highly recommend this game to those who like puzzles or want to learn basic computer code. It is different from todays version of programming, but it makes you wonder and understand how programming and math might have began.","Nice Little game... Had fun playing it, tho i finished it after 8h (Without OCDs (u get them in half of the levels anyways without trying)). So its probably not worth the money cause u get less than an hour of gameplay for 1 Buck.Conclusion:If u like Puzzle games and its in a sale its defently worth buying :)","The most fun you can have with Assembly.","Q: Where do you see your self in 5 years?A: Re-Playing this game for the 10th time.I love this game and if you like logic puzzles you will  too.","As a HR professional IRL, I initially thought this would be an employee management simulator with a \"Tomorrow Corporation\"-twist and shrieked in delight. That's the sad thing about loving your work. The idea of pretending to do my day job inside a video game and in my spare time excites me...Of course, I was wrong. Human Resource Machine is a low-level programming puzzle game with a few HR and performance management jokes thrown in along the way. You pick an employee and \"code\" their workflow to automate a particular job, and with each level it becomes messier and more complex. Most frustrating of all are the optimisation challenges, which force you to rethink and rewrite solutions which may work perfectly on their own, but falter when it comes to \"efficiency\".It gets tough quite quickly, and as someone who dropped Maths at school as soon as I was allowed to, I was often left stumped. Luckily, my intermediate knowledge of PHP\/Javascript helped a little, and the game does a good job of introducing new commands one by one, so there is a great feeling of progression as you pick up new concepts and techniques. Despite the difficulty, it's ridiculously fun and somewhat educational.My only negative comment would be that the UI is a little clunky, forcing you to scroll up and down if you have over 15 lines of code (zoom functions would be a great addition) and hand-draw notes rather than type. However, the developers have cleverly added in the ability to copy and paste code within the game as well as in into external programs like Notepad, for those who like to get down to the nitty-gritty.As expected from the creators of World of Goo and Little Inferno, the music and graphics are delightful, and whilst there isn't so much of a storyline going on behind the scenes, the gameplay is captivating and very rewarding.HRM combines three of my passions - HR, code and video games, and it does so fantastically. A truly unique game - especially worth picking up if you have programming experience, and if you don't, why not start here?","This game is an awsome little gem :)Working out the best way to meet the challenges is entertaining, especially on levels where the same code can't be used to get both. Adjusting from as few lines of code as possible to as few step executions as possible can take some thinking.","Okay I finally got the last floor. I know how to program a bubble sort but this scripting language makes it so hard.","This game is pretty amazing and a great way bust your brain for 30min. I cant say much about the story (because I havent completed the game yet) but i'm in hope it will be as meaningful as little inferno. I have to give it to tomorrow corp for implenmenting their corp into their games without being annoying about it and keeping their art style.overall if your an adult or a kid you will adore this game and a no brainer to buy. 10\/10","Do you like programming assembler?Do you want to learn to program assembler?Was TIS-100 to unappealing or barebones for you?Were you pissed off about the spatial fitting necessary in SpaceChem?Human Resource Machine will be the game for you!You'll learn about pointers, direct and indirect jumps, zero-terminated strings and more without any of the terms being used anywhere! And all this in the quirky & surreal artstyle you maybe already know and love from games like World of Goo and Little Inferno!","Brilliant Game, highly addictive and very challenging! a+ 5*!","Fun, challenging, but too short. I beat it in a little under 5 hours. Still, it was a fun five hours, so I have no qualms recommending this title.","It's fun and really stimulates the brain. Similar to Poly Bridge except for bridge building, you are programming to fulfill an objective.","Do you like programming?do you remember dealing with GOTO?do you like maths and recreating multiplications wit additions?this puzzle game is for you.","Wrote a 27 command code for a level that needed only 15. 10\/10 Would code again.","IT'S LACKING DEVOPS AND SCRUM MEETINGS BUT OTHERWISE IT'S OK","If you enjoy programming, then buy this game!The majority of puzzles are simple and the \"language\" itself is based off low-level Assembly with a single accumulator so you are met with constraints compared to the majority of programming languages; however, if this game based itself on modern programming languages, there would be no challenge since every puzzle in the game would be trivial!Solving the storyline puzzles is pretty easy in itself but figuring out the optional problems can be tricky and fun, especially if you enjoy wanting to optimize them (as I did).I did find it annoying since the only jump conditionals you have are \"Jump if Negative\" and \"Jump if Zero\" compared to any assembler's multiple jump conditionals as having a \"Jump if Positive\" would have definitely saved me a few lines here or there.The UI is a bit clunky since copy and pasting segments of code only works for your entire program and not for sub-sections of it. If you want to insert comments into your programs or give your memory cells names, you have to use an awkward drawing tool using the mouse instead of typing what you want.Needless to say, this is still a fun game for those who enjoy solving math and puzzle problems using programming. It's also a nice introduction for people who want to get into assemblers.","I'm always a sucker for programming games and this one is no exception, it's a load of fun and very satisfying. But having just spent a minute or so looking at the menu screen, my favourite thing now is the horrifying way it manages to create an aesthetic which is simultaneously \"cute\" and \"corporate dystopia\".","I am a programmer (and so I'm familiar with the theory behind the puzzles), but this is a brilliant game. Should be used in computer science classes!","This is a great test of your logical fortitude. If you stick with it and stay calm, this is an amazing puzzle game. Anyone who loves programming will love this game.","Well thought out game. It's fun to strip bare computations we take for granted. Learned a bit about sorting optimizations and why loops work the way they do.  Felt like a tiny lesson in computing history.  Had some minor UI gripes, but that did not stop me finishing this game including almost all optimizations in only a couple of days. 9.5\/10.","Great Fun .... buy this game. A very unique and well thought out game. - really refreshingGreat for kids too, until the harder puzzles hit aroundf level 20  :)","A fun, entertaining little game that is basically an exercise in programming assembly. While I'm personally satisfied with the game, it does dump a lot of concepts on the player quickly with minimal explanation. Non-programmers will likely find the difficult curve quite sharp and there seems to be an assumption that the they will probably have to go to Google.The storyline teased at building up to something but - and this is not a spoiler - it ultimately fizzled into irrelevance. It felt like how a book would read if the author stopped writing halfway through and wrapped things up with a weak, premature ending. I would like to see the game paced out a bit more with some better explanation of concepts. As it stands, I struggle to recommend it to non-programmers despite how much I enjoyed it myself.","Fantastic game, though a little short. They should do expansions, that thaught the player to program Phyton or another language, harder than this Assemply like programming.","I have a Computer Science degree; and getting some of these optimisation challenges is, well, challenging.I am only part way through the game, but so far far is has been very entertaining to play, and I would recommend it to anyone with some experience or interest in programming - so long as you are willing to use your brain!","I love me some Edu-GAME-ment!Pretty good game, I like it. Yes.","As a software developer I couldn't help but see how people have tried to gamify my job. Helping the creators of World of Goo was another incentive to give this game a shot.My verdict is if you can solve all of the problems in the game efficiently and quickly then you pretty much have a good grasp of very low level programming. Real world programming is not nearly as tedious or disorganized (well, not all the time) but I found the game quite enjoyable and worth my money.If you know how to code then the game is super easy but for everyone else, this game is a great glimpse into an entire industry. This game should DEFINITELY be put into grade schools everywhere. DO IT NOW for the greater good of humanity. If I played this rather than Oregan Trail as a kid, I'd probably be a god at programming now instead of an amateur historian.I want to see all high schools deploy this game as a part of their curriculum.Many of us have seen those \"coding games\" where you type code into a web interface and it basically checks if you did the code right. To put it bluntly, this medium is not very engaging. I don't see too many people having the motivation to slug through soul crushingly irritating syntax errors or logic errors. There is simply no way to actually visualize what is going on. I mean come on! It's like teaching someone English by forcing them to memorize words. The letters of the alphabet and other fundamentals go right over their head.Then comes Human Resource Machine. It is quite minimalistic and is basically rudimentary assembly programming with only registers and pre generated values (I believe it's still Turing complete). The value of this game is that you can actually see what is going on \"inside the computer\". There is no computer in the game. All operations are done by you, a lowly mailroom working sorting through some paper, and that is the genius of the game - it goes straight to the core of programming and right away users can get a feel for what the field is about, they are learning the alphabet.The game is an exercise in logic and process reasoning. It can be a springboard for full on programming, but it has practical applications in many professional jobs. That is why I think high schools should seriously consider implementing this game into the curriculum. It has tangible benefits to mental acumen and could change many people's lives.","Fun game, no programming experience required, but problem solving is:Review posted when I had 4.8 hours of playtime.Possible tagline: \"TIS-100 for the masses\"Pros:Wide variety of puzzles of varying difficulties, plus there's optimization challenges for each level. Fairly easy to understand system.Introduces pointersCons: Feels kinda short (at this point I've beat al the main levels, all but one of the side quest levels, and just over half the optimization challenges).Completely mouse driven, which normally isn't an issue, but at times is annoying.\"Code viewer\" is long and skinny hard to see where you need to be sometimes.introduces pointersPlease note that I am also a software engineer, so the above criticisms may just come from my personal experience and someone with less knowledge in the area may be better off.Overall: a great game that I would definitely reccomend. However this can in no way be substituted for an education in CS, so don't say you're a wonderful programmer after beating this game.EDIT: 100% at about 8.5 hours, again though, I'm as programmer, so I do   this kind of thinking for a living. Still recommended.","Implemented bubble sort on the last level. It required 1868 steps to complete. It took forever, 10\/10.But seriously, this game is about transforming input to ourput using a growing set of commands.It starts of pretty basic to teach the player about the available commands and gradually becomes more complex. The later levels will be hard to complete if you are new to concepts of algorithms and programming.","This is a puzzle game that asks you to solve simple low level programming challenges. The game is quite similar to TIS-100, which was released a couple of months ago. Human Resource Machine is a bit more fleshed out when it comes to graphics, music and the setting (all have a lot in common with World of Goo), but TIS-100 had a better user interface and more complex puzzles due its weird multi core architecture. It is a lovely little game, but if I had to recommend one assembly-like programming game in 2015, it would probably be TIS-100. There is something ingenious about how TIS-100 encourages you to learn all important tools (except stack memory, I guess) and sets you free to use all of them from the very first puzzle. In comparison, Human Resource Machine feels more \"gamey\", with clearer restrictions and a gradual introductions of tools.In conclusion, I would still recommend this game for fans of the increasingly popular programming puzzle genre, and possibly also for fans of World of Goo and Little Inferno. Be aware that some of the later puzzles may be a bit difficult if you have zero programming experience.","Have you ever wanted a reason to write a sorting algorithm in assembler? Then this might be the game for you.","Suprisingly hard. First few easy as pie, even for someone that isn't a programer. The give me more information is laughable.  It is a very sarcastic help. It is like no I understand what tripling the number means, but could use a hint as to how to do that. It isn't there. Nice sounding scottsman did a walkthrough:D It is fun enough though, and helps you understand the concepts. Not sure entirely worth the 9.99, but definately a steam sale grab her.","Remember those days where you used Scratch in junior school IT class? HRM is like that, but for adults.","Human Resource Machine can hardly be called a game. It is a visual programming environment. The goal of the game seems to teach people how to think like a programmer, and I think it does an admirable job at that. It manages to make players visualize what a variable is, how to create ordering in your commands, why runtime errors occur, and how to test and debug. I have some misgivings, though.First, there is little fun in the game, except the fun of solving a programming puzzle. The people for whom this program is most useful, will hardly find any fun in that.Second, the language the game uses is GOTO-based, and it isn't for nothing that GOTOs have been more or less banned from programming languages in the past 40 years. They make a program completely unreadable and unmaintainable, and that is exactly what happens with this game.Third, it is ridiculous that only about 15 lines of code will fit on the screen. A zoom function that would allow you to see more of your program if you want is sorely missed.Fourth -- and this is the most important complaint that I have --, the OCD challenges are unfitting for this game. You can try to create a program in the least amount of memory space, but memory space is no concern of modern computers. You can try to create a program that uses the least number of cycles, but speed is no issue for modern computers and compilers optimize well anyway. By adding these OCD challenges, the designers make the player focus on those things which are least important in programming. When I teach people programming (and that is part of my job) I want them to write readable, maintainable code, and not create an unreadable mess because it is 10% faster.I'd like to use this game as a teaching tool for beginners, to get them to think like programmers before delving into the arcane mysteries of a modern computer language. I wish I could get a version without the OCD challenges. And perhaps a version with real loops instead of these jumps with conditions.Still, I recommend the game -- though not as a form of entertainment, but as a teaching tool.","did arithmetics.did sorting.unrolled loops.optimized probably frequent paths.Basically, I struggled at what a basic C compiler would do.1010\/1010 would fail the turing test again","If you are a programmer and want to learn more about real basic programming like assembler or a register machine, this is the game for you. For anyone else, this is more a tutorial about computing than a game","An awesome little puzzle game that is secretly teaching you assembly code.","Great fun, and potentially very educational for people interested in programming\/how computers and processors work. I see myself recommending this game to a lot of my friends.","This is an excellent puzzle game!If you love logic and you like to play with maths you'll enjoy this.The game is easy in the concept, you have a list of inputs which you have to transform in a list of outputs following the requests of the level. In order to transform your inputs you have a list of possibile commands that you can use for your purposes.Someone says \"To fulfill what the level asks I could use simpler solutions, but the game doesn't allow them\", well that's idiotic! The gameplay is actually that! To find the most efficient solution using only the commands the game offers, that's the challange. And it is fantastic! It allows you to be creative, and create different solutions, knowing that there will always be one which is the most efficient, so, when you find that solution in a hard level, it's really satisfying.The funny context is present and really cute, but simple so it lets you concentrate on the beautiful puzzle gameplay, this is everything a puzzle game need to be.ConclusionsIf you smart, you buy, duh.","Super fun, adorable atmosphere, great music... I got addicted to the game immediately and was compelled to finishing it in around 2 days. But, finishing the game doesn't mean an end to the fun because you can keep coming back to solved puzzles and try speed and size optimizations.My assembly programming experience helped me with some of the problems, but I think it's a great educational tool for even non-programmers. Hey, it's not rocket science -- It's just computer science.Doing assembly again for a change was a very refreshing experience for me! I'd highly recommend this game to old timers who used to dabble in assembly.Verdict: Perfect.","Good way to learn basic programming logic","Should I be a programmer to play it?No. My 11 year old is on level 22. However, he now calls himself a programmer.Will this teach me programming?No. If completing this is in your CV, you will remain unemployed.Will I be a better programmer once I've completed it?No. You were probably a better one before.Is this a high level language?No. However, that would depend entirely on your altitude when you looked. I'm an elite class Jedi coder. Should I?No. Because it doesn't matter what you do, someone can do it better, in less lines and less iterations.Will I enjoy it?No. Unless tearing your hair out writing 50 lines of code when 5 would normally suffice appeals to you.Is the author a good programmer?Yes. Pre-empting outcomes with any given code - before you write it - is elite.gg.9.5\/10.Would get 10 but the coffee room is full of very ugly women.","A few notes to understand before you buy this.This is not just about programming.  This is about machine level language (similar to basic opcode programing)  That means your nice IF\/THAN\/ELSE FOR\/WHILE loops and Functions don't exist as you know them.  How you feel about that and the challenge that style of programming presents will determin if you like this.My 5 year old was able to understand what was going on so you don't have to be a programmer to be able to get into this game.  However If you complete this game without help you may have what it takes to be a programmer.  I have met programmers who this game would drive them crazy so just knowing how to program doesn't mean you will like this.   In general you need to like challenging logic problems or at least enjoy them enough to not care if you get through this game quickly.I have a fairly analytical mind and still remember enough from my machine architecture class 12 years ago that I was able to complete the game in less than 12 hrs without writting anything down or doing online reseach.  I still have some challenge stars I can get and the game was only $10 so I have to say I'm happy with it.","It's one of those evil games that tricks you in to learning something by having a fun mechanic with education value. A++ Would recommend for anyone who enjoys maths, puzzles, or programming. Would not recommend for arts degree holders.","As a beginner in programming and someone who immediately recognized the visual style of Little Inferno, I really love this game. The difficulty went from 0 to 100 very quickly near the end, and I must admit that I'm still stuck on the last level right now. But I'm glad I didn't finish the game yet, I wouldn't have expected a game about programming ever but this was an excellent surprise.","Really fun game if you love programming.  If you've been programming assembly language for years, it should be easy to get through it but still a challenge as the game rates you against optimal minimum lines of code and number of executed operations.   This is also an awesome game to introduce beginners into low-level programming which is fundamental to develop robust skills at programming.  Many programmers do not learn assembly or machine code at all these days, and do not understand the concept of a microprocessor, registers, pointers, pipelining etc.  These are simple concepts to understand when starting out with an open mind but it seems harder for experienced programmers to get their mind around.  It's amazing how many programmers don't grasp pointers but it's pretty fundamental to understanding how to write efficient code and effectively using a debugger to test code.Just bought this game and ran through about a dozen and a half levels, but I am already addicted and know this game has infinite replay value.  Absolutely worth $10.  I would pay another $10 for this on Android so I can play it anytime I want.One additional note: The music in this game is beautiful, atmospheric and perfect.  It reminds me at times of the Bladerunner soundtrack by Vangelis.","Other games have tried to teach assembly-level computer programming through puzzles before, but perhaps none have been as clever as Human Resource Machine. This is a very challenging logic game with top-notch presentation and a well thought-out interface that keeps things from getting too frustrating. Very well done, Tomorrow Corporation!","What a little gem of a game this is....and boy is is frustrating! I think Steam will need a new genre entitled perseverence!Essentially it's teaching you how to code, but in a fun and relatively simple way - though by the time you're on level 33 it's certainly not so simple!Highly recommended for anyone who wants to learn the basic premise of coding or wishes for their kids to do so, but even just for a laugh (which is where I am on this) then it's still good fun and beats the usually monotony of most games.10\/10 for ingenuity","i am useless without my < > symbolsthis is pain11\/10 would spend more time on this than my intro to programming  assignments again","Its basically Assembly Language class. Ive read a few other reviews here, and the negatives bring up a couple valid points. There is very little handholding. They expect you to google to learn the concepts, then do the exercise in all but the most simple puzzles at the start. The game is more like a question booklet rather than a textbook, so you are solving problems not learning the material you need to solve problems. If you have some programming background and need a referesher on assembly, or if you know programming and want to try your hand at some assembly type problems without actually doing assembly code.... this game could be useful and entertaining. But if you are looking to LEARN, this game will not teach you very well. You will need to do the learning else where and come back to this as an exercise.As an exercise, its good and I reccomend it. As a learning tool, I do not reccomend it. You should be aware of this before buying. I will reccomend it because I like it, but really take my words as a warning before buying it. Its for a specific audience.","To think that programming can be turn into ANOTHER good for a chance of me throwing money at it has worked. Spent about a good 20 mins playing around with it, knowing nothing about the prograaming, before  realizing how much time I've spent outside the game to learn about come core aspects of basic programming. And, that's just to get past later stages 15+. The worst part, for me, is tryignt o understand what I'm suspose to do before putting in a sequence of commands from a search engines about coding... stuff spoken in that language's tongue. So, yeah, if you not a programmer or have atleast a years worth of knowlegde, this game will become impossible around lvl 15. No, the in game help wont help you. Matter of fact, they are dumber than you. Don't believe me, try the game for yourself.","Great if your interested in programming its a gentle introduction, the background story looks good but I didn't get too far.Programmers may find this SUPER annoying and want to go grab TIS-100 as the ony input is a drag and drop mouse interface which can be slow and there is no way to skip ahead. Also the lack of copy paste segments of a program make the block (scratch-like) interface even more annoying. Overall great game but without a text input it gets really annoying and grindy.","Wonderful presentation of the inane dullness of programming.","fun","This game is really well done.  I write software for a living, but still find this game challenging and fun and different enough from \"real\" work that I don't mind playing it in my spare time.  The puzzles are kind of like writing in a simple assembly language (which I haven't done in many years), so it requires a shift in thinking to complete the puzzles successfully.  Great game; only wish there were more puzzles as I've almost gotten through all of them.","Cure, fairly simple, and fairly short... It'd have suggest either waiting for a sale, or for more content to be added I'm afraid.","Human Resource Machine is a lot like Little Inferno, in that it's a short sweet experience in which you just want more once it's over.You have to run very basic programs using very few limited instructions to come out with basic algorithms and once I got given all the controls at my disposal, the game really opened up to me and I had a lot of fun (and trouble) coming up with solutions to the problems I could do in C# in minutes.I am a programmer by trade, so this game was probably a little easier for me than most as I've already been introduced to basic concepts the game teaches, such as Linked Lists, but even then it was a great challenge. The final task specifically was amazing once I got it running and my solution is horrendously unefficient, but I plan to go back and fix it later.The only downside I can really mention is that once I got all of the ways to interact with the system, I was hoping for one or two more, especially functions so I could easily repeat code, mostly so it'd be tidier and not the horrible arrow filled mess half my solutions ended up being.I really recommend this game, especially for programmers looking for something to do that still keeps you in the right mindset.(Also the artstyle, writing and general humor of the game are fantastic as well, but the puzzles are what made me really enjoy this game.)","A lot of people seem to be complaining about the difficulty curve and that you require some programming knowledge. More than half the optomizations for your in game code are unrealistic methods that are never used in real life. This is simply a logic puzzle, and you don't require any programming experience whatsoever. To a certain extent this is great for teaching you basic programming logic, but it's not going to help you learn how to code simply  because the logic required to solve puzzles differ so greatly. It really is just a game to test out your logic, so I recommend getting it anyway.","I am super impressed with this game so far. I am a programmer IRL with a passion for both: getting people into the field younger, and also raising awareness of how programming concepts are applicable beyond the very limited scope layment are aware of. Ergo, I am always excited to try programming-themed games, and when I saw that the makers of Little Inferno had come out with a new game, I snatched it up no questions no research.So here's the thing. I love trying programming themed games. I hate nearly every one of them. Nearly every one of them overbearingly forces pithy metaphors on you, and struggles to find a balance between infantile dumbing-down and overcomplicated concepts that don't lend themselves to the interface. Human Resource Machine has leapt straight to the top of my list for ability to convey programming concepts.It's not perfect. The language is little more than the lowest-level assembly, which can raise the opacity of the puzzles for newcomers. As a programmer I am reaching the point where I desperately wish I could create subroutines, if only for jnez! And there are some nuances to the way the game calculates the number of actions your program requires that can lead to unintuitive changes required to hit the optimization goals - not to mention that neither of the optimization goals are actually realistic methods of optimization. But so far I am enjoying the game, and would absolutely recommend it to anyone who has a little experience to basic programming and is looking for a casual game.","Very nice game.","None nerds need not apply. Some experience in programming is recommended, but not required.There is about 5-15 hours of gameplay depending on your level of experience. Story wise Human Resource Machine < Little Inferno.The puzzles are well thought out and logical in progression, side area puzzles take the concepts of the main progression to more extremes.The graphics are charming, and some of the jokes are laugh out loud funny. Make sure and talk to the person observing you to hear them all.I would rate this game 8\/10 -1 for story-1 replayablity","If you like programming puzzels or just want to train your logical mind, this is the game for you!","Good game got me pulled in. hard as expected","EVERYTHING EQUALS 100% FINEWhere is Carol?P.S. My brain hurts from all the thinking, but i'm enjoying the game","Small game.... good for getting the old nogger ticking again. A bit high on the price side, but overall worth it.","I normally love the games Tomorrow Corp makes, but this is just plain bad.  I did manage to complete teh game in under 6 hours as I have done programming work in the past and understand logic problems well, that said this sucks at its' use of programming.  If you understand anyrhing about programming you will see this uses a lot of recursive style programing.  Recursive programing is the slowest possible way to accomplish any task.  It is also very hard for the average person to understand.  This lacks the enjoyment of all of the other games published by tomorrow corp.If you enjoy recursive programing then by all means enjoy otherwise this is not for you.","10 hours of gameplay for someone with zero programming experience (two of which I spent on the prime factor generator since I would rather spend two hours mindlessly making a table up to 24 than 30 minutes with a piece of paper to come up with an actual algorithm, and I even beat the speed optimization by ~200 cycles for the trouble. No, I'm not proud). The suggestions at some points to look up concepts are optional, unlike what some of the negative reviews are suggesting. I have no idea what Boolean logic or XOr refers to but I got through that puzzle without skipping a beat.I'm sure that familiarity with these kinds of problems would speed things up immensely, but there's no reason to be intimidated or assume you're going to have to do 'extracurriculurs' if you don't have background knowledge. Any puzzle enthusiast (and what are you doing reading this review if you don't like puzzles?) should be able to tackle this with a little patience.I love the open-ended nature of these puzzles, where they give you an objective, a box of tools, and tell you to hop to it, and wish more puzzle games would take a cue from it. The feeling of getting closer and closer to the solution as you remove bug after bug is an extremely gratifying feeling I rarely get from other puzzle games, where often you are led to 'almost solutions' and eventually have to go back to square one when it turns out there's no way to make it work. Even on the rare occasions this did happen to me, I didn't feel like I'd been misled since I was the one who made the damned thing.The only real complaint I have about this game is that the setting and story are really threadbare when compared to the other games by these guys, though it still has some of that dessicated charm that I loved from World of Goo. Kind of nitpicky, though it would have been nice to have something to absorb you outside building program after program.Edit: Another gripe I have now that I'm trying some of the optimization challenges (semi-spoiler): A lot of the speed challenges are solved simply by repeating coding sequences instead of just using a single jump loop because a completed jump counts as a cycle. This strikes me more as busy work than anything requiring much thought, and seems like a wasted challenge.Overall, extremely satisfying, and the most fun I've had playing a puzzle game since World of Goo. I don't know how it compares to other games in this small genre, or how it should be received by experienced programmers, but for a layman such as myself, it was an absolute blast, and I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a middlingly challenging puzzle game  with a big change of pace from your average fare.","It must the Year of the Indie Programming Sims, because there sure are alot in that category, or at least in fringe group categories.The devs that did this also did World of Goo and Little Inferno, which were incredibly endearing games with storylines that emotionally moved me. No exaggeration.Now onto 'programming games'. I do programming occasionally, for work purposes. I am no stranger to logic structure, BUT I am no expert in it either. TIS-100 was super awesome fun at first, and then it was a chore. The same problem goes for this title here.So here is the thing: If you like programming games, this one is fairly lite. It is also fairly short (~5 hours if you are decent at logic puzzles). If you don't like programming puzzles, run away. If you like them, this is probably a fun afternoon.A good review should be less of a personal opinion, and more of a statement that helps a potential buyer make an informed purchase, or not. I would down-vote this for my personal taste, but it is certainly a well done game, by a well-accomplished developer. Upvoted because it deserves it, regardless of my personal taste.Peace,","This is a charming and sometimes incredibly difficult logic puzzle game (really it's just visual assembly programming with registers and jumps). I'm about halfway through and the optimization challenges for the levels are tough. It's definitely rewarding when your code works and the little guy executing the commands does everything right.As you progress through the game the little cutscenes get hilarious. I definitely recommend this game.8\/10, it's worth the money.","Great fun, and great for pretty much any skill level. Non-programmers will find it a wonderful introduction to programming, and computer science majors will get huge gameplay milage optimizing their solutions. As an intermediate programmer, I found the game challenging and rewarding, and consistently pleasurable. And beyond that, it's a game with something to say. It's funny, moving, adorable, and a worthy companion and successor to Little Inferno.","Besides the fact that it plays like a mobile port (a big negative in my book), it's just too short to be worth the money.The puzzles are OK, but not terribly interesting once you've mastered a few tricks. If you do decide to play, here's a hint: They give you copy and paste commands for a reason. (That hint should tell you something about the nature of the game!)Cute to look at and tinker with for a few minutes, but not a keeper in my opinion.","Too short.. Gameplay is very nice and enjoyable. When price of game is compared with gameplay duration, It is very expensive. I liked game play. It would be nice if there were much more puzzles.","Easy to learn and I love the artstyle. Would recommend to anyone who feels intimidated by learning to program.I'm currently on level 19 and the algorithms you come up with already get rather complex without the ability to define functions\/methods. It's a nice way to see what it was like to program when higher level languages weren't invented yet.","If (YouLike.LogicPuzzles && YouLike.Programming){You = \"love this!!\";}","Just love you guys!You did what I always wanted to do bu was to busy\/lazy to ! Congrats!The game is quite fun also.","Another brilliant game from the Tomorrow Corporation who made World of Goo and Little Inferno. The Human Resource Machine is basically a simple computer simulator where the puzzles are programming problems. As a game, as long as you like logic style puzzles or are interested in programming then you will probably love this. If you are learning to program or want to use this as a teaching aid.. you'll love this too!Early puzzles are pretty straighforward but later puzzles are not so easy. For an extra difficulty twist there are two optional challenges on every level and they can be very tough indeed. There is a huge sense of satisfaction when your program does as intended.I wish I'd had something like this when I was learning machine code on a Commodore 64!10 out of 10 for me.","It doesn't matter what these guys do. Bridges made of goo, kids burning their toys to keep themselves warm, my boss teaching me how to code... I don't care what they release next, I WILL buy it.Because each of the first 3 games was a unique masterpiece in its own right.","Let me put it this way:bool shouldBuyGame(unsigned int age, bool casualGamer, bool programmer, \/* etc. etc. *\/) {  return true;}","This is a fun and clever puzzling with an intriguing dark back story.Fundamentally, it's a game that teaches programming. It also requires some mathematical knowledge because puzzles include multiplication and division with only add and subtract instructions available, as well as the Fibonacci sequence, the difference between div and mod, and more.If you're a coder, or have a logical and mathematical bent, you will enjoy the game. If you are an FPS player only then this has nothing for you. I think it is a good way of introducing mathematical logic and programming concepts to young children, as well as being engaging for adults too.My video review","Amazing, joyful and charming introduction to computer programming. From simple addition to an alphanumeric sorting or decoding scripts - it will teach you how to create simple algorithms using an easy drag-and-drop interface.The only complaint I have is that as soon as I started feeling warmed up - the game finished. I wish the levels continued, but then again, maybe I should just get a C++ or Python compliler and continue there.","I had a lot of fun playing, but it was even more fun watching my dad try to figure out how to play. 11\/10 (Some of my dad's \"solutions\": http:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/zseIc )",null,", what a game! By far the best puzzler i bought in 2015PROS-Great Puzzles-Hard, very hard to complete all the challenges-Simple to understand, hard to master-Not expensive, worth the money-IndieCONS-None so farHighly recommended!","Awesome little game. Totally worth the money.This teaches the basics of old school programming brilliantly. Variables, loops, pointers, the power of correct naming and commenting. Pure genius. Awesome, well done and thank you!","Fun little puzzler using really basic programming structures and math, all in  cutesy graphics and music. Enjoyable casual game that doesn't let you go so fast :D","This game is just awesome!!","If you've played TIS-100, you might find this a bit easy. Fun, but short.","Human Resource Machine is a delightful, polished puzzle game! The gameplay ticked all the right boxes for me (I'm a webdev). I couldn't put it down during my first session (5 hours), and neither could my non-techy room mate (3 hours). Get this game if you'd like to demystify programming thought patterns in a fun, rewarding setting.","An adorable assembly language programming game where your character executes the programs by \"read\"ing from an input conveyor, \"writing\" to an output conveyor, and using numbered boxes for storage, carrying intermediate values between these entities (the PC is the accumulator register!)  The instruction set eventually includes read\/write, load\/store, add\/sub, inc\/dec, and jump\/jump-if-zero\/jump-if-negative, including indirect variants of the memory operations.  Probably an excellent way to learn about pointers.Took me about 3 hours to finish the main campaign and most of the optional side-missions, but some of the ones I haven't finished yet look like they may take a bit of work, and others could definitely stand to be optimized.  No actual programming experience should be necessary (the game introduces concepts slowly, provides hints, etc), but it'll probably take somebody who has no programming background longer to work through all the content.If you enjoyed SpaceChem or TIS-100, this will probably appeal (though it is simpler).  If you enjoy Human Resource Machine and want more visual programming challenges, SpaceChem has a lot of that, or for more textual programming puzzles with a similar instruction set but multiple nodes, give TIS-100 a look.","This is not a game about programming, it is about logical operations. If you know a little or a lot about coding, I can't recommend this. Too often you feel like you're trying to walk with your legs cut off at the knees - you see a problem & know immediately how to solve it, but the tools required are not available.

The puzzles weren't too hard for a programmer, but I had plenty of fun and came up with dozens of solutions while tring to optimize them.Flaws: it's irritating that some things that work in assembly programming don't work in the game. For instance, if D - B = 2, why shouldn't B + 2 = D, instead of an error? It makes some things more annoying than they should be.Also, there's no code block copying and you can only save 3 solutions to any puzzle - both problems can be overcome by copying your solutions into text files, but you shouldn't have to do that.Finally, I found it boring that many programs could be speed-optimized by merely unrolling loops. I know that's a real technique, but it just isn't that interesting. Maybe you could make unconditional jumps free?

The music is not really important, but didn't annoy me, although I turned it off later to listen to my own music. Sound effects can get a bit annoying in the longer puzzles but that's only natural.The puzzles themselves are not very difficult or very easy. They are somewhat challenging, especially if you try to get the optional challenges, which the game warns you are hard. They are. If you are familiar with programming puzzles, this is that.

Comments are hand-drawn, which is fun but I can never get in much information. You won't need much of them because the programs will generally be short, but it's an annoyance. The max speed at which the programs run is also just too slow; I got bored waiting for the final few programs. The game seems made for touch control. Like with real languages, this fake one has some limitations. I didn't mind the language that much, but it's a shame you won't actually learn a new language from doing this (although it can help improve your skills). They also explain some concepts very minimal and then tell you to look it up on the web if you still don't know.The story is very thin; don't expect anything of the level of Little Inferno. Overall, it is a fun programming puzzle game in a good package. There are free alternatives, but the overall package is done very well. Difficulty scales well, the look is cute and there's a tiny bit of story sprinkled on top. It's a shame the game has some annoyances but you probably already know if this is the game for you. The game is also very short.Recommend if you like programming puzzles or if it's on sale and you like raw puzzle games.","how i can change the lenguage? please","I played and loved both World of Goo and Little Inferno. Human Resource Machine does not live up to their legacy - it has significantly less depth of story and gameplay. HRM's story is just a linear sequence of predictable events. I'm going to ruin it for you: Something is wrong, robots are coming, robots have come, robots have taken over, you've been obsoleted by the invention of the computer.. That's it. Maybe you get another cutscene if you 100% all bonus objectives, but how inane the story is so far, I doubt it'd be worth it. (EDIT: With help from the forums, I 100%'d all levels and got all achievements - didn't unlock or change anything)The gameplay revolves around programming a very simple computer - it gets some inputs, your program runs, and it emits some outputs. The inputs are numbers and letters. In a few levels, the letters actually spell something! Yeah, it's usually not very exciting. The problem is that the primary source of difficulty is how bad the programming interface is - you drag and drop instructions in a list. You can only see about 15 instructions on the screen at once, and you'll often end up with a big mess of overlapping arrows.Finding solutions is easy, but inputting them into the computer is tedious. You're basically spending most of your time as the compiler, not the programmer. There are only about 5 levels that are actually difficult to find the solution to. The game is only 42 levels, of which roughly 20 are trivially easy tutorials, 17 are frustrating but not hard, and 5 are actually challenging.The ending came very suddenly and left me thinking \"WTF did I just pay for? That was barely a game at all!\". I get that World of Goo took many years to build and Tomorrow Corporation are probably trying to make smaller\/cheaper games faster, but HRM isn't a good small game - it feels like they took the design for a big game and cut it in half, leaving something that feels very incomplete.","Bought it on release day because of the theme\/mechanic and my previous love for World of Goo and Little Inferno.Really fun, approachable programming puzzles game.If you're a programmer with any bit of knowledge about ASM basics, you can see right away what you're in for from the screenshots. Solving the levels (ie just having a piece of code taking the input and generating all correct output) is simple enough, but aiming for the optimizations challenges (in both number of instructions and number of steps to run) will keep you busy for a while :)If you're not a programmer, or if you've only played around totally visual languages, this is a neat intro to barebones concepts: the floor tiles of the office represent memory storage, and you only get basic tools to do the work your boss wants: get a value from the incoming conveyor, copy it's value to a floor space, add and compares values.. Create loops to repeat steps with jumps in the code.. Get what you need done and put the correct results on the ouput converyor belt. You start by only reading and writing boxes all the way to do sorts and all kinf od neat tricks :)In my case, this was really in a sweet spot: I'm in IT, but not a programmer, except from time to time having to do scripting. I made my way on my own to the end credits, came across optimized solutions for maybe a third of the puzzles, and enjoyed working with others and learning tricks to get to the rest.A big plus for the Steam version: the forums are full of really neat people actually discussing tips and tricks and sharing solutions.The only \/slight\/ disappointment: while there are cutscenes and a bit of a story, it is \/not\/ as fleshed out or.. hmm.. clever? as the ones in previous titles from the same people. If this is primordial to you, this is something to consider before buying. For me it would have been a cherry on top, but I'm happy with all the fudge and peanuts. Now I'm hungry.Definitely recommended.","Mind bending. Should be used in schools","While this is completely worth the 10$ I spent, and I encourage others to spend, I will say in terms of story\/meta-narrative this rests lower than WoG\/Little Inferno.","Fun assembly language puzzles","In short, programming tutorial game. Buy this if you like logic \/ puzzle game.","A fun and entertaining game for both programmers and those that know nothing about programming.  You'll love it!","Why did I buy this game? I've just lost 6 hours of my life to the optimization of programs I can't use outside of this game.On the up-side, it's easy to pick up, but hard to master, I definitely recommend, it's not massively long, but it's got enough \"can I make this better?\" -ness about it that you can carry on playing long after you've finished the main compaign.Well worth the 6.99 I paid, I've not finished it yet but it looks like I'm close.An experienced programmer could probably finish this in about 4 or 5 hours or so, us mere mortals will take longer.","NIce fun game. Though wish it was a bit longer and with some more parts to it. But overall fun.","Just made it to the sorting floor!this game has some really hard puzzles, and you dont need to know how to code or anything to do it!too bad I beat year 39 with 89 commands when you only need 14 :P","Review for non-programmers:I think this game is easy enough to understand for anyone and can be a valuable insight on how computers work or what your nerdy geek friend is talking about all the time. Most puzzles are mainly focused on logic as supposed to the programming (which is as basic as you can get it anyway). Most problems are known problems that are easy google-able (which the game even reminds you of). Google fibonacci and you will see what I mean.Now the biggest question though: is it fun for anyone that isn't a complete geek? Well I can't speak for all but simply the prestation and artstyle is already quite entertaining. So I recommend it to anyone who likes puzzle games in general and those who have an interest in computers in particullar.Review for information scientist & programmers:I'd still recommend. The programming is so basic (it's basically assambler but with less functionallity) the challenge here is to remember how to make an >= comparison with jump if negative commands only. In the age of Java it is quite nice to be reminded of the roots again and the hardware restriction one had. The real challenge for us is the optimization challenges it has where you need to reduce runtime and\/or code length. One minor gripe with the game mechanics:Some of the commands are inconsistend. The sub-command for example substracts the value in the box you chose from the value you are currently holding, But it doesn't change the value of the box it self, so you have to save it manually afterwards.If you take the bump -1 command instead the box value is reduced by -1 and you pick said value up at the same time. You get used to it, but it is annoying the first time you try to make a programm and the thing doesn't work because the commands act differently from what you expect.","A game that make you smarter.The progression curve is on point. I always want to see what's next and I am never disapointed.Totally worth your time.","Absolutly an amazing puzzle game made by a genius. Nice one to improve your logic and coding skills!If you cannot handle frustration, not your game! But I love it!","Great fun!  Not too hard to complete the main path, but plenty of extra play time with the optional optimizations and side paths.","As someone who does not do any programming, I'm finding this game quite fun - coming into it without solid knowledge can be a blessing (if you're me) or a curse. I can see why it would be sort of hit or miss for people who do program.I'm struggling a bit but I don't feel totally out of my depth. It's definitely forcing me to think differently, and I think in a more logical fashion. The puzzles progress well, so you don't feel totally unprepared for each level. If you can, avoid looking up exact answers to each level - you'll only feel more and more lost as puzzles progress. Sometimes it helps to ask for a bit of help - I couldn't figure out on my own how to do multiplication with just addition available to me. A hint from someone who knows more than me helped, and I was able to construct something on my own from there.Do I feel like I'm learning about programming? Not really. I think maybe going from no knowledge to this game is a step in the right direction, but I doubt this is a good primer for much of anything other than very general concepts.I'm only about halfway through at roughly seven hours, but I've read that people with more experience do breeze through quickly.The art and music are similar to other games from the devs, though the music isn't quite as good as I'm used to.I'm seeing hints of a story here and there, and look forward to seeing where it goes. I'm going to guess it's on par with Little Inferno (which was somewhat weak to begin with).Controls are kind of awkward. You  have to write on your labels via mouse and not keyboard. Some folks in the forums can point you to places where you can implement text into the labels, but I'm not quite inconvenienced enough to take extra steps. Sometimes I find myself meaning to pause and instead selecting 'stop' (there is no 'pause'), which resets the input so you have to run through all over again and make double sure you hit the 'back' or 'forward' buttons if you want to go line-by-line before hitting an error, at which point you are given the option to debug line-by-line. Any alterations to the code also reset the inbox, so you can't see exactly what your modification would have done with the original variables you had been working with.For ten bucks, if you're either into logic puzzles with no programming experience, or experienced but cool with liberties being taken and what probably seem like arbitrary restraints, it's a good buy.","Frankly, this is a fine little collection of programming puzzles, but there is no reason to buy it rather than Zachtronics's similar TIS-100 or his classic SpaceChem. Seeing images of Human Resources Machine, I had assumed that it would do something similar in terms of exploiting space to create programming puzzles; in fact, the real game is played in a sidebar full of simple commands. Where the little man is on the screen is completely irrelevant---there are no collisions, nor even a command to move to the space right or left. Instead, you deal with space purely as a list of numbered addresses. TIS-100 and SpaceChem both force your programs to move through space, creating a novel riff on programming with problems of adjacency and making efficient use of limited space to accomplish complex tasks. HRM, by contrast, is much closer to working through an introductory CompSci problem set. The game is also marred by a poor interface; commands can only be entered by drag-and-drop, where the keyboard would be much simpler to use.This isn't a bad game---three to five hours of decent puzzles without finishing some of the harder challenges---but it really has nothing to recommend it over a Zachtronics puzzler. If you like this one and haven't played them, you're in for a treat.","Absolutely ingenious.","As a programmer, I love programming.  So it's no surprise that I love programming games.But Tomorrow Corp games also have a ton of atmosphere and it makes them even more special.If you like logic or puzzles at all, this is a great game."],["This game is incredibly well designed and implemented. I'm an academic at an Australia university in IT and this game would compliment a programming fundamentals course quite well especially for students who are completely new to programming. Although I think it is even worthwhile for those who have programming experience.10\/10","Picked up this game today beat half of it in one 3 hour sitting gonna keep going. Just addicting puzzles. Its like tis-100 but easier and funner because you come out of it learning stuff. What makes this better than tis-100 is the ability to debug. The ability to step forward and backwards makes debuging so fun. That is why I prefer this game over tis-100. It does help to have some programming background or to do some research if you want to beat the time trails. This is comming from someone who has never programed assembly on a real machine before. So if you have no programming experience expect your programs to run slow and the amount of code to triple on what the challenges expect.I'll be honest the first time I did the last level it took over 1000 steps to sort all the strings given!!!! lol","It TECHNICALLY is a good game, but for some strange reason,management always wants me to have a 0 as the last output in later levels (without it being part of the task given to you). Thats probably a bug worth fixing,cause it seems to happen to me EVERY SINGLE TIME,making the tasks literally impossible to solve. If they fix this, this game is a must buy.","Human Resource Machine is a nice little programming game. It functions kind of like Assembly language, but is different enough to be unique enough. You do NOT need to know any programming, but it definitely helps.The difficulty curve is about what you'd expect from such a game. You start with your basic \"Hello world\" programs, of course, but you get into program structure (also known as \"jump\" commands) soon enough.My only major complaint is how comments and variable names are handled. Both consist of a small doodle box where you use an MS-Paint-like freehand tool to scribble in your comments and variable names. It helps the game's overall atmosphere, sure, but I'd much prefer just being able to type in the boxes instead of having to scribble.","A decent game overall I would say. First off, people with basic programming skills will probably whiz though this game fairly quickly, I managed to finish 90% of the puzzles in one 5 hour sitting. Any real issues you'll end up facing is using your programming knowledge and implementing it into this games ui, which can be a little cumbersome at times.However, this game seems to be quite welcome to people who have never coded in their life. It teaches the basics steadily and in an easily understandable way, but I found the puzzle difficulty to ramp up maybe a little too fast. I watched a LPer have a crack at this game and started to really struggle at year 5, and just ended up quiting :CEach year has extra challenges too, and these are aimed at the highly skilled (at least the later years). It presents some extra diffculty to a puzzle if you're up for it. But as I said and the game itself states, this challenges are very hard, maybe a little too hard; as they require a very specific solution in a very flexible enviroment. It's quite difficult to \"trim the fat\" from coding normally, this game makes it an even more tedious task.One other downside is the story. Normally I wouldn't complain about this as I prefer games with interesting mechanics over games with a detailed story (not that I don't enjoy them). But Human Resource Machine hasn't really tried all that hard. All you really get for story are brief cutscenes which most point to the \"robots will replace humans\" trope. While a fitting story for this game, it's not explored.... at all...Other than that, I nothing but good things to say about this game, awesome music, the \"tomorrow corporation\" artstyle and I've not encoutered any performance issues or crashes playing.tl;dr+ Interesting puzzle mechanic implemented well+ Awesome music (where's my downloadable soundtrack?)+ Great introduction to programming, or just to test your current skills in a neato enviroement- Lackluster story- UI can be cumbersome at times- Challenge requirements are too specific7\/10","harder then dark souls","Wow! Daughter and I are having so much fun exploring program efficiency (really). Thanks Kyles!","if you like TIS-100, you'll probably like this aswell. Starts really easy, gets more challenging to get optimal programs.","It's a fine game, no doubt about it, I just don't think it's worth 10, wait till a sale :)If you like programming I'm sure you'll like, if not love, this game, but if you hate brainbrakers, stay away!","A fun game with a unique twist on puzzle solving.  Definately a fan.","A fun game about programming puzzles in an assembly-like language. Starts out really easy, but gets really hard, I couldn't beat the last side branch level. I got 4 hours of playtime not counting time spent4 going back and optimizing previous levels.","If you're a non-programmer with an affinity for logic and maths and want to learn in a fun way how computers work at one of the lowest level (that is assembly), go for it! You will learn interesting stuff. If you're grossed out by the thought of having to figure out how to find the rest of a division of two random numbers using only addition and substraction and basic logic, you should probably pass because you're not going to enjoy this game.If you're a programmer and want to remember your old school days of learning basic sorting algorithms and\/or assembly -> go for it! The levels aren't that hard to complete, but the challenges (code size requirements and execution time requirements for each level) will definitely have you rethink your solution and pull your hair trying to optimize as much as you can. The only subjective thing is how much \"fun\" can you have writing programs and optimizing them within a game? There is nothing to \"cover up\" the fact that you are indeed sorting number chains and character strings, so if you're not having fun doing this, what's the point? The game atmosphere is very similar to other games from the same studio (world of goo, little infermo) and by that I mean that the story is very minimalistic and mysterious, and the humour is very cynical (you're basically working within the game).It took me approx. 6 hours to complete the game and various challenges (Im missing 30% of the latest levels challenges to be 100%), but it was definitely a fun experience that made me think back about basic logic and how difficult it is to perform operations like sorting that are very easy to do with higher level programming languages. Recommend!","Pros:Great little puzzle gameCons:Not enough puzzlesCan't turn off in-game sound!!!At the $10 price point it's definitely worth a purchase. If it were more than $10, it would not be worth a purchase. But it isn't, so it is.","Nice game, but errs too far on the easy side while being too expensive for the length.All in all it should be no problem to solve all levels including the bonus levels within 3 hours. Granted, here are still some optimization puzzles, but (at least for me) this does not give the needed long time motivation.So, it would be great if the experience were a bit longer or the game were cheaper. As it stands, I can recommend TIS-100 more: It costs less and lasts longer.EDIT: Changed to positive after price as dropped. My main complaint was the skewed length-to-price ratio, which has been rectified a bit.","Assembler-like programming puzzler, having a lot of fun with it!","best indi game i'vd ever played","this game is only for programers","for people that haven't programed this is kind of like programing.if you are a programer the jumps commands will drive you mad.","Great little game!

Highly recommended!","Super awesome!","Well, I played through it in one sitting. Assembly instruction set style logic puzzles. Throws me back 20 years doing stuff like the ACSL programming contest. Totally dig that art style, too.","Meh. It's a decent set of programming puzzles, and maybe a light-hearted introduction to programming, but the puzzles didn't offer much. Spacechem, Infinifactory, and TIS-100 all had far better, more interesting puzzles. If HRM had been the first of its kind, it would have been impressive, but compared to the other games that already exist, it was just more of the same.I was also really looking forward to seeing how the story turns out. Spoiler: there is no story. They keep aluding to something big developing, but it never really happens. At least when Little Inferno had you waste your time pointlessly for hours, and aluded to something else, there really was something else at play. But not here. The ending really falls flat.For $10, it was a little diversion, and if you wanted to churn away at some of the challenges, you could get a few hours out of this game, but I completed the main quest with mostly perfect scores and tried a few of the optional challenges, and made it just over 2 hours, and was left disappointed by the ending. I'm not even sure that's worth $10.","Human Resource Machine is very enjoyable, albeit rather short, but if you're like me and haven't used the most basic math concepts in over a decade (let's face it, doing math using only addition and subtraction is not something you use on a daily basis in this century), then the first half or so of the game can be extremely challenging.The game gives you a very simple (aka limited) programming language to solve its puzzles and the challenge really comes from the limited commands at your disposal. Other than that, the gameplay is really simple and the problems not that hard. Beating the efficiency challenges can however be excruciating. Technically speaking, however, the game is an obscenely bad PC port and for a game with programming as a concept, it's pathetic that Tomorrow Corporation has released the game as is. We can only hope they get their s.h.i.t. together and release a patch that turns this into a proper PC game. Sure the game runs fine and stable, but these are extremely basic things that are required for releasing anything on PC:- The game lacks every form of settings menu. There are no volume sliders, no resolution\/graphics settings, no way to adjust the audio levels or mute the menu music whatsoever. This is basic stuff that needs to be in every game and releasing a game without is sheer incompetence.  This needs to be fixed.- On Windows the game defaults to borderless window, which is fine for most people, but then it positions itself on top of everything else, which is bad and makes it pointless to run in a window in the first place.  This needs to be fixed.- The game refuses to be minimized. You can force it minimized by dropped to the Desktop, but as soon as you then go into another program it maximizes itself again. Again, this needs to be fixed.- Hitting Alt+Enter will force the game into regular windowed mode, which is the only way to keep the game from burying everything else you have running. It's also the only way to get into the audio mixer to turn down the game's volume (which you wouldn't have to if it was made properly).- Completely lacks keyboard support. Yet it has the ability to make labels and comments, without accepting keyboard input (yes, you can draw crap, but even on touch devices that's obnoxious). This is inexcusable and needs to be fixed. Pretty sure the tablet version doesn't support keyboard either, which just doubles up how bad that design decision is.Other than that, the game runs at a solid 60 fps, the audio is way too loud (even at 15% it's really loud), it has the same cutesy style as Tomorrow Corporation's previous games, and it is fun for the few hours it lasts (frustration included).","This is an amazing game \/ educational tool. My 10 year old who I could not pull away from minecraft seems to have taken this game as his new thing. He has been able to out solve me on several levels and has grown beyond my coaching. As an IT professional, I wanted him to do more than game; I wanted him to learn how to make the games. Until this his only real motivation was portal and AGF pro (that was a disapointment). Now he sees the logic in my encouragement through this game. Now I need to know what to do when he completes it. final note.... this is what education should look like, not standardized test.","This is a very fun puzzle\/programming game. It's *way* more accessible than TIS-100, due to how the game is presented and the fact that you don't have to type anything :-)The first dozen levels are pretty straight-forward, and serve as a basic tutorial.The next half dozen are a little more complex, especially if you want to get your puzzles done with the \"challenge\" parameters of using a certain amount of instructions and finishing within a certain number of execution steps.After this, the puzzles become a lot more complex and they require a lot more thought to optimise for the challenge.I'm doing a let's play series where I try to play all puzzles and get them optimised withing challenge parameters.

I thoroughly enjoyed this game and the challenges it brought with it. I only had to look up a solution once (the coordinates puzzle, though I think I would've figured it out if I was a bit more patient) and as of finishing the game I only have one optional puzzle unsolved (prime factors, because come on).I wouldn't recommended this game for everyone, however. This game requires a logical mind and persistence. The game rarely holds your hand through these puzzles, so you're largely left to your own devices. If you find the experience of being stumped by a proposal and gradually figuring it out rewarding, then this game is for you. If you tend to get frustrated with tedium and puzzles, and don't have the patience to work to a solution, then you won't enjoy this game.","PLayed the game twice all the way through in a couplre of nights. Its a fairly short puzzle game, but if you like programming these are excellent programming puzzles. The language is almost like assembly, but with a very small instruction set so you have to find tricks for doing basic things. Its almost as hard as using the esoteric language brainfsck. I'm a professional programmer and I loved the concept. It's probably going to be very hard if you don't know a thing or two about some programminig techniques such as sorting algorithms. You might not need to come back to it again after you've solved all the puzzles and earned the optimization points for the fastest and\/or smallest solutions, but its cheaper (and more entertaining) than a night at the movies.","A fantastic game about logic programming.  Starts out fairly easy but quickly becomes hard and hard until you just set back and go \"Damn lol\".  The art style, the music, the animations and design... all what you love from Tomorrow Corp.  Same folks that made world of goo.  Fantastic game devs.Buy it now."],["After 5 hours of playing this game I am now a major developer. Thanks, Tomorrow Corporation!","Very disappointing. You expect a surprise somewhere along the way and then it ends when the complexity of the game start clashing with the impossibility to efficiently use the interface.","This is an excellent game for people who enjoy a nice collection of logical puzzles. But i consider it to be an even better educational software. It does a great job to show you in a very playful way how the very foundations of our computer programs are put together. If i was a teacher in a computer science class at school or even providing a basic lecture at university about algorithms, i would definitely make a recommendation for this game as it should cover the most common algorithms in a very demonstrative way. So naturally if you are already familiar with a programming language, you will find many - if not all - levels of this game easy as many negative reviews have already made clear. However i have serious doubts that anybody can perform all OCDs of this game on the fly. Some are trivial, some are easy and yes, all of them are usually tought in a 101 computer science algorithms lecture. Still even when you heard those lectures, you will most likely not have all the perfect solutions available from the top of your head. So even for someone from the programming or computer science business collecting all optional objectives should be nostalgic and challenging to say the least. There are only a few minor downsides:* a flat story (see world of goo, little inferno), which i do not mind* low number of levels (around 40), but still enough for several hours* occasionally steep learning curve* many OCDs are not the optimal solution (i surpassed both criteria in several levels)* loop unrolling is not exactly a \"challenge\"","ASM much?","Awesome","Puts the R back in RISC.","While this may be superbly easy for those who have taken some sort of programming class (idk), this is a great little puzzle game. Using a small set of rather basic commands, you have to perform a variety of tasks. The difficulty curve is well done; the game starts off really easy with little difficulty increase as it teaches you the various commands, but then cranks up the difficulty at a regular rate once it has taught you all of this. The regular puzzles are hard but in a sense that you shouldn't need a walkthrough and can probably figure them out yourself if you try hard enough, while the extra puzzles require some harder thinking.For those that found the basic following of the game easy, each level has two challenges you can fulfil to get 100%. First, you must successfully carry out the objective with under a certain number of commands. For the other challenge, you must have your character complete the challenge following as few steps as possible. Whilst for the first load of levels, the solution to both of these challenges is usually the same (and often whatever solution you come up with), as the game progresses, some levels require a different solution to each of those challenges, and they require some extra thinking.Overall, this is a neat little puzzle game to anyone. Maybe the story is weaker than most Tomorrow Corporation games - while there is the sense of the same sort of atmosphere as in the previous games, it doesn't really come through strongly.","Learn a pretty basic assembly language, but with little office workers instead of a dry terminal.It's awesome to teach kids the basics of programming. I wonder if, in 20 years, we'll see this genre like we used to see edutainment back in the day.","Human Resource Machine is another one of those programming games. It is a game based on Assembly. You get a problem, you make algorithms.HOWEVER, I have some issues with the game....okay, A LOT of issues with the game.1. The UI was designed for a touch screen device. Very frustrating on a PC2. The code is super unreadable. The jump commands are all over the place and the comments do not help (then again this is assembly I guess I'll let this pass.)3. Why the choice to make comments handwritten? Even with my pen tablet, it is hard to write things. It seems unresponsive, and the line thickness makes space limited and hard to read.4. A short game.5. The story is bland.6. It is hard for people new to programming, and easy for people who have experience in coding. The steep difficulty curve makes it that way\/7. The settings are limited.8. The optimization challenge on Level 2 is bad. You had to hard code the inboxes and outboxes to get the speed challenge. Sure, it takes less steps, but isn't that a bad practice in coding? I'm sorry Tommorow Corp., I love your other games, but this game is a no from me.","This game is amazing...  It was swallow your soul...  But it's amazing","This is a fantastic game if you're interested in puzzles and\/or computer programming. It consists of a series of programming challenges, roughly 40 in all, using a simplified form of assembly language. The programming concepts are introduced gradually, with the puzzles ramping up in difficulty as you progress. For an extra challenge the game includes harder optional puzzles, and all of the puzzles have optimization goals (program length and execution time) that test even relatively experienced programmers. My young kids (12 and 9) got really into this game and one of them went on to learn Python afterward.","I absolutely love this game. The music and atmosphere really make it shine, but I also found the gameplay simple enough to pick up, but challenging and rewarding, definitely getting me addicted. If this game interests you, definitely buy it.I wish it was a little longer, but it was still superb. Also, I really want the soundtrack now."],["Amazing little puzzle game, teaching you the basics of programming on a low, assembler-like level. It is fun and educational at the same time. Some math skills are required.Graphics are sweet with the known \"Tomorrow Corporation\" art style.

The Game play itself can get abit frustrating, But like any puzzle game its most likely your fault and y ou can fix it by slowing down and walking step by step till' you find the problem, but like all coding you fix one another pops up. I am currently playing though for my youtubez and its quite enjoyable.","Maybe a little \"easy\" for programmer, but contains good challenge for normal people. Great artwork style. Original. Very good training tool for kids, to introduce them to the programming world.","Fun game with intuitive controls. Haven't tried any similar games before (other than real assembler programming) but this was easy to get into and start playing. The game seems pretty short and lack of certain instruction sets (like multiplying numbers) can make easy tasks a hassle. The art style is well executed but maybe not appealing to everyone. tl;dr Would recommend!","I thought I would like this game but there is WAY too much math involved. Ugh... I work all day doing this crap- the last thing I want is more numbers.","When I thought my assembly skills were lost in this world, I found this game 8\/8","A clever and innovative experience! A perfect installment for your steam library if you are looking for something different to play, or if you just want to boil your brain. It is a perfect combination between simple programming strategy, and math. Did I mention how catchy the intro theme is?","If you like programming and\/or challenging puzzles you will enjoy this game.","Good fun, really charming. worth your money!","Even though I am majoring in computer engineering now, some of the late problems were challanging to me. Probably the main reason for it would be that this game is requiring an assembly code based operations, not familar C\/JAVA based operations.For the person majoring in computer engineering, this might be an good mind-freshener, or could be a good challange.And for the others, have fun in making logical mess through trial and errors. *wink*","The bonuses are hard to get and you will need help with some levels.","Incredibly fun little game. As someone with only a basic programming class in my old school career, I find this game perfectly challenging and entertaining."],["Overall, I love this game. Computer scientist \/ mathematician by trade, so this type of stuff is a fluent language for me. Great game for testing out logic puzzles in basic computing terms. Also works as an introduction to assembly, as you get into using registers and low level commands to solve most of the problems. Was slightly annoyed by the lack of internal volume controls other than a BGM toggle, but that's a relatively minor problem.","Super fun game, especially if you're into programming and logic puzzles. The last third of the levels are pretty tricky, but super rewarding to finally beat one of the levels.","Pretty fun game, although I wish it was longer I still enjoyed it. It is a great problem solving game that begins with quite simple problems and progresses into very elaborate problems. I would recommend this to anyone who is interested in puzzle games or is interested in programming.","If you don't spend enough time during your workday optimizing algorithms, then this is the game for you!  Admittedly, that's probably a narrow market segment.  But I am in that segment, so nuts to you other types!  Wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!","Highly enjoyable puzzle game. You take numbers from the inbox, run them through your custom algorithms, then put the correct number in the outbox. Just hard enough to make it a challenge but easy enough to make it playable and not frustrating.","\"Computer Science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes\" - Edsger W. DijkstraThis neat little game presents some basic computer science concepts in the form of puzzles.The first few levels are devoted to adjusting you to the game's \"syntax\". Next, it throws in the concept of memory and shows you rougly how computers function at a lower level. FInally, training wheels off, the game puts you up to the task of designing algorithms and data structures, concepts which although they mostly see their use in programming, are rooted in mathematics and are sure to appeal to anyone with an interest in numbers, not just computers.Although the main game is relatively short, there are plenty of bonus levels and optional challenges that should you attempt them will certainly require some extra thinking.","It's a good game if you're familiar with programming otherwise you'll probably be looking up the solutions on Youtube.I'm about halfway through the game (level 20) and it's finally getting difficult enough to make me realize this isn't some super simple game, up until this point I had all the code optimized fairly easily and didn't have a hard time figuring out solutions. I'm at a point now where it's clear where the game is headed which is why I want to advise against purchasing this unless you truly are willing to become a programmer, it's not really a fun game unless you enjoy programming.If you love programming however this is your thing, great game uses some psuedo based Assembly language...except it's nowhere near as powerful and is much more limited so even if you are extremely familiar or an expert in Assembly like me you'll still have to figure out new things to do with very basic commands.In the end this makes things like comparing numbers a much more complex thing so instead of a few lines you'll have many...many lines storing values to add or subtract the value finding the result etc. That's not so much the problem but because the only real branching available in this game is Jump if zero or Jump if negative you'll find that most programs are oversaturated with Jump commands. While it's pretty funny and thought provoking to run through 10 - 20 Jumps in for conditional programs, if you're learning programming this is not exactly efficient or even how programming is done. Rest assured it is much more simpler than this game to figure out if two numbers have the same sign or not in actual programming. LMAO","I have not spent a ton of time with it, but I am about 75% of the way through the game.  As a software developer, I was pleasantly surprised by this game.  The instant I saw the jump command, I knew exactly what was going on--Assembler.  It's a language you never want to be tasked with using for a real project, but I took a sort of perverse pleasure out of using it in the form of a game.If you are interested in learning how to program, this is a great place to start.  You will most likely never use what you learn here directly, but it will prompt you to think and visualize in the same way that you must in any serious development project.  When you are done, you will also have a new appreciation for the higher level languages, their vast libraries, and all of the memorization that comes with them.  After all, what's a little basic memorization compared to this?That said, a couple of the challenges were a bit dull and uninspired.  The first time I had to unwrap my loop into duplicate commands to complete a speed challenge, I appreciated it for the lesson it was trying to teach; however, doing this without proper copy\/paste is such a chore that I absolutely loathed it the second time around.  If it happens again, I may very well break something.Other than that, this is a really cool concept nicely executed--if a bit short.","Cute and fun with just the right level of challenge that almost makes you forget this is an  introduction to programing."],["Another game of the creators of Little Inferno.Another master piece. Really those guys are geniouses, the game is funny, cynical, cute and surprisingly dark altogether. An general and subtle feeling of sadness lies behind everything in this game's rigid and control-freak company of \"IN AND OUT\". You know something's hidden from you all along the game... just like an burried secret.Definitely a piece of video game's art.Buy it! Awe at their poetic and mad world, learn the very basics of coding in Assembly language and enjoy!","Not for everyoneThis game is based on building programs with few, very basic commands. Even though many other reviews stated that it helps if you are accoustomed to actual programming, I would disagree. It's not really like any programming with actual programming languages like C or Java. It's enough to have a basic idea about how to break down a problem to many smaller steps and then compile these steps to an algorithm. If you like these kinds of puzzles this game is for you!This is why I bought the game, even though it is rather short compared to other games at the same price. That's why I would recommend buying it, when it's on sale.What is great about the game:  The artstyle is very unique as in most games by these devs. It combines creativity with maths\/programming. There are seemingly endless ways of solving a given puzzle.Neutral: The game has a very dark theme, again a bit like \"Little Inferno\".However there is one big aspect of the game I was disappointed about:The Story: I expected the story to be at least close to the story in \"Little Inferno\", but it wasn't. That is an aspect of the game where the developers really wasted potential. There is a story in \"Human Resource Machine\", which mainly consists of machines slowly taking over the world. But it's nowhere near as well told or thought through as I expected. I would have loved it if a story would be implemented like in \"Papers Please\" where you would get to see the newspapers headline before each level. In \"Human Resource Machine\" you only get short video clips every ten levels or so.Summary: This game definitely isn't for everyone. I personally really enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone who likes these kinds of puzzles. You should note however that the game really doesn't consist of much more than these puzzles. I bought the game expecting a great story and was disappointed. Rating: 6.5\/10Buy it when it's on sale, if you're interested in the gameplay.","Great game. I thought this was the perfect introduction into programming for newcomers and enjoyable for those who have experience ( I am a software engineer by trade) -  I still found some of the levels challenging; especially if aiming for speed & size challenges.I introduced the game to my little brother and it brought a huge smirk to my face to watch him get the Ah-ha! moment of understanding what a computer\/CPU truly is at its bare minimum ( a set of basic instructions).Things I would like to see changed:1 - I wish they included a level maker and you could maybe post some challenges online. 2 - I dislike having to write comments freehand. Allowing typing would be great otherwise it is not very useable.Well worth the money.","You can't go wrong with Tomorrow Corporation.

This game does not require you to be a programmer to play, but is highly recommended for anyone who is interested in programming or how CPUs work. It is not punishingly difficult like Spacechem, it only requires the ability to think logically.","Human Resource Machine is a wonderful game.  Starting with very simple tasks the game quicky becomes a head melting array of challenges.  Building on simple commands the solution to tasks can become large and complex and simplifing your work is essentail if you don't want to lose you mind in add, sub, bump and jump commands.  Well worth it if you enjoy puzzle games with a hint of nerd.  Confident maths skills (or a calculator near by) will help a lot in this game but don't worry if you don't know anything about code the game teaches you everything you need to know to comple the levels.  I still haven't completed this game yet I think it's going to take some time but the satifaction of watching a completed programme run smoothly is worth the pain of de-bugging and head scratching.","Amazing game, one of my favourites from just a little playtime so far.Before you get this game however, do not underestimate the thinking power required.","Game is short and programmer puzzle centric. If that doesn't bother you it's a good pick","Little procedural programming game. I just feel like I'm at school again, programming fun little things...

More challenge with keeping playing. hope more games like this.","I enjoy the logic in this game. It is challenging, but it makes it more fun. Having multiple ways to achieve a solution is another thing I like about this game. It is almost close to being a programmer. If you enjoy logic puzzles, this is a great game to try out.Warning: This game has no sound control. You have to use system sounds to lower it. It is very loud.","HRM is an ingenious simulation of manipulating bits in memory registers using assembly level commands. It sets out puzzles that require the worker to move inputs on an assembly belt to the output belt using only the provided commands and floor cells. It's incredibly engrossing and suprisingly challenging. The only serious flaw is the commenting system. Rather than simply allow the user to type in comments, it forces the player to draw them using the mouse. Perhaps someone thought it was cute, but it's a serious handicap, since it means that practically speaking, you're generally not going to bother adding comments given that they're extremely tedious to create. And when your program gets really complex, comments become very important. Otherwise, it's an outstanding game. 9\/10","A real good game","For those who like to program, I recommend this game to you!","This is once again a prime example of brilliance in simplicity. The graphics style (still) looks great, and the puzzles are well thought out.The language resembles assembly, and it's this purity of the language that make the puzzles challenging. There aren't hundreds of prebuilt functions available like in modern programming languages, you have only the basics at your disposal. A lot of fun if you enjoy puzzles and especially programming puzzles.","This is a nice little puzzle game with a very nice artistic style, and a strange backstory and ambience.You get a visual representation of a programming language, with different commands that are introduced slowly to not overwhelm the player. There are challenges at each level, where you try to optimize your program either by number of commands or number of steps taken. There is a main path of puzzles, and some optional paths that are harder.As a programmer, I found the beginning levels quite easy, but it got hard very quickly and is quite challenging.I recommend this game to anyone who is a programmer, wishes to learn programming,  or just likes puzzles that require a lot of planning and thinking.","Super fun and challenging puzzle that really tests your logic. The game's atmosphere is fantastic and keeps you engaged.

This game is the perfect choice for the ones who like solving puzzles and programming. The tasks are easy to understand yet challenging. The essential idea is not to achieve the desired output but to get it with the fewest steps and commands. It is a great game to play in your free time without tiring you. Doesn't require high hardware configuration; graphics and music are not bad.

The theme is applied pretty well, and adds something to the game.It isn't particularly long, if you are familiar with programming you could get through the whole thing in a day with both length and speed challenges beaten, but that seems reasonable for the price asked.Unlike TIS-100, the challenge limits seem to be fixed, rather than based on what users have actually achieved, and many are not the best achievable, so you never know if you could push slightly harder to get an even better result. I'd like it if they added that sort of global leaderboard aspect, so you knew what to aim for.One downside is that because there is no limit on program length, beating the speed challenges is often simply a matter of applying loop unrolling, which while a very useful optimisation technique, isn't very ... elegant.","Really fun game. As a real-life programmer, the puzzles are not really challenging to me, so I went on to complete all the optimization. The puzzles and tactics are really well-designed.

As someone who does understand programming language, I thought the mechanics of the game were really interesting, and I loved playing around with different solutions. That being said, the mechanics are introduced in a way that teaches the mechanics in an easy to understand manner, while still being interesting, providing challenges to players that have more experience in solving puzzles in this way, but some wiggle room for players who are still learning. The levels are presented in a way that encourages players to think about the level and figure out the puzzle for themselves, instead of just looking for a walkthrough, which Ill admit to being guilty of in the past. I loved the quirky art style and the amusing, if simple, plot, but that really takes a backseat to the gameplay. I'm not saying that's a bad thing, not for me, but if you're someone who plays games just for the plotlines you might be dissapointed. Definitely check it out if youre a fan of coding or puzzles, and are looking for a challenge that makes you want to keep trying, instead of just quitting or getting someone else to solve it for you.","I knew I'd love this game from the moment my wife pointed it out to me on Steam, and I was right. The art style and mood of the game is equal parts Nightmare Before Christmas and Paper Mario. It's amusing and friendly, and makes assembly language programming really accessible. And that last point is really what makes this game great. As a professional programmer, I'm always happy to see new pathways for entering the field.One of my most memorable childhood experiences that led to my love of programming was an exerise we did in school where the students gave the teacher step-by-step instructions to make a peanut butter & jelly sandwich. For example, a student might say, put the knife in the peanut butter jar, but if the lid was closed, the teacher would just bang the knife against the lid a bit to the sounds of raucus laughter.Human Resource Machine is probably the best embodiment of those ideas I've ever seen, and you'd be forgiven if you thought it was just another puzzle game at first. However, the puzzles can get pretty challenging, especially if you are going towards the optimization goals.Any programmers who don't have much exposure to low level coding should get this game. It will give you a much better intuition of what's going on under the hood in your programs. This is especially true with the way the animations play out. Watching your toon wander around the play space, picking up data from boxes, moving them to other boxes, etc. helps you identify unnecessary\/duplicate work, and other possibilities for optimization.As a final point to drive this home, I spent last April and May doing a job search. At least 50% of my interviews\/code tests involved problems with the exact same structure as many of these puzzles. If you can do well at this game and haven't done any programming before, you might want to consider a career change. ;)THAT SAIDWhile this was released as a desktop-only game, the UI was clearly designed for mobile (or at least by mobile designers), and it's rather painful: ALL input is done with the left mouse button, including writing comments and labels. You have to draw them with your mouse which is annoying to begin with, but the only editing tool is \"undo\" which removes the last stroke you made. This makes it really tedious to make minor changes to an exsting program, and also means that when you copy\/paste the code to share, it adds a bunch of base64 encoded binary data rather than a nice, textual comment in context with the code.  There are absolutely no options besides \"toggle fullscreen\" and \"toggle music\". The lack of volume control makes sense on mobile where you're only doing one thing at a time, but desktop games should always have their own control. I'm glad Windows offers app-specific volume controles these days, but I shouldn't have to resort to that.Anyway, those gripes are nothing compared to everything that is good and wonderful about this game. You should buy it right now.","Logic is a core part of human education that was pulled out of the norm, you are doing yourself a favor when you purchase this game.If you enjoy higher maths and analytical thinking, then likely logic has something to do with that.  It is fun.I discovered this not from Human Resource Machine, but from a semester course in college. The beauty does not entirely come across quickly unless you realize the game is showing you ways to see the universe early on, even though it is still fun.Later on, both in class and in the game, if you do not think mechanically enough or fully understand a conjunction then you can spend a few minutes or hours looking for a ray of hope.  This can either be calming or boring, depending on your mindset.  If you learn from the experience (eventually), then you will benefit even if it was not fun, so I recommend the game anyway.If you have an oppurtunity to learn First Order Logic from a person with a background in Philosophy, I recommend it, since they will likely spend more time with what some proofs and conjunctions mean about our world.This game was made by game developers, and uses a system that works best on computers even if it is harder for people to read, so there is another reason to supplement.It fills my heart to be doing this again.","A fabulous introduction to programming, with a cutesy 1950s office aesthetic. The puzzles are fun and devilishly simple, really showcasing the difference between human and computer logic. The introductory levels are stupid simple- accesible to children, even- with later ones ramping up into some very difficult logical problems.Wonderful way to kill a few hours, and it scratches a programming itch I didn't even know I had. Worth the buy.","Fun if like me you like exrtremely fiddly technical puzzles.But I wouldn't recommend it to anyone I know. Story is basically a 4-frame cartoon. Not much educational value either, unless you want to learn to program in 6502 or earlier machine code. Pretty short game too."],["This is an awesome game.

After 10 hours I am on the final level, however I still have not gotten the 2 stars (or optimization challenges) for every level.  So I still have several more hours left I suspect.  For $10 USD I would say that is well worth the money.","As someone who is majoring in software engineering I find this to be a fun game.

And the feeling if you suddenly grasp the solution is great.Also a good game to play together with others (on one computer), if you don't like puzzling alone. It's really fun trying to figure it out together.- Only thing I missed thus far is an option to copy-paste part of the 'code' you have written. As far as I can see, it is only possible to copy ALL the code you already wrote, which is usually not what I want.","*keep in mind that I am a programmer, a newb, but passionate*I haven't finished the game yet, but it is without a doubt one of the best games I have ever played; and it delivers if you want to learn math\/programming\/life.Fun: It is edutainment, and it does it well.How it runs: I think this is where the game really shows it's masterstroke.

Every day, I would wake up, drink some tea, open up the game and just try to clear a level or two before I did anything else. It was entertaining and felt very fullfilling. Sometimes I would go to sleep and think about how to clear a level and then wake up like \"I GOT IT!\". I'm a very laidback gamer, so I don't play a lot of games. At all. So I find it impressive that this game managed to keep me entertained for 10+ hours and even made me think of it outside of those hours. Usually I just stick to sudokus, nonograms, etc. But this felt a lot more fun than those mundane puzzles.I don't have anything bad to say. The game explains the mechanics well at the beginning and it's clear what your goals are. Obviously, the first levels are very easy. It just keeps stepping it up a nodge. I do remember clearing the first 19 levels very quickly, then being stuck at level 20 for an hour. It was funny how big the leap was for me, but I could overlook it. I was very glad to have these kind of tough challenges thrown at me after I got into it.The game was worth every cent to me.

For example, you can copy, paste, add or substract but you can't multiply or divide. At the beginning you just need to add 2 and 2, but this rapidly escalates to making divisions (still without a division tool!), sorting data in alphabetical order, and extracting prime numbers!It will require quite some creativity, experimentation and debugging to achieve, but you will be surprised and amazed how simple the solution always is.It's about programming and yet it's not actual programming. It just teaches you how how to \"think\" like a machine. If you actually have programming skills you will possibly find this game too easy, or frustrating. Otherwise Human Resource Machine is a really challenging experience; it will require you to imagine and conceptualize your programs beyond what's displayed on the screen, until you find one of the solutions. There are many ways to solve each puzzle. Sometimes you think you've got it, and the game will throw an error message and then kindly feed you a different sequence to demonstrate how your program was flawed.If this prospect doesn't scare you, go ahead and dive head in; I warmheartedly recommend Human Resource Machine!","Interesting game but holy bananas it gets hard around lvl 15.

Easy for someone who already knows how to program, probably, but a pretty steep learning curve for me. If you like that, then yey! If not...well, find another game. Personally, I LOVE it. Like I said, little bit of a steep learning curve, but it's rare for me to find a game that doesn't stress me out and that does make me actually think. I love the story line and the atmosphere - really very similar to their other game, Little Inferno - that same sort of unique, cheerful bleakness.

You'll look at basic input and output algorithms using simple programming buttons like \"Inbox\" , \"Outbox\", \"sub\", \"add\" and many more. It will slowly up the difficulty as you climb the corporate ladder so to speak. It's challenging enough to keep you nitpicking your code until you get it just right. There are challenges for those that seem to fly through it that forces you to optimize your code on a previously defeated challenge which is easier said then done sometimes.The graphics are cute and the audio is nice and crisp and suits the title. The game's music can get a little repetitive after a while but just listen to your own tunes and program away. The game has an incredibly small footprint too, so even older and space strapped machines should be able to run this easily. I am currently nearly about half way through (not including optimization) and can honestly say that it is an excellent game.

And Human Resource Machine is a good assembler programming game. The presentation is adorable, the UI is functional (although liable to drive anyone with real-world coding experience to distraction), the puzzles are smart, and the difficulty progression is measured. So why arent I more enthused with it? I think that the problem lies with me. Ive dabbled with code over the years, I took an Assembler 101 course in college (which literally involved solving many of the exact puzzles provided in this game), and Ive played other games that did the same job better. And by that, I mean that Im a fan of Zachtronics games. Between SpaceChem, TIS-100 and Infinifactory, Ive solved much harder and more complex coding problems. By contrast, Human Resource Machine is a bit of a snoozefest. And therein lies the problem. Human Resource Machine is an excellent coding game FOR PEOPLE THAT ARENT EXPERIENCED CODERS. For folk with any degree of serious software chops, this isnt going to stretch them.

You program a little worker by clicking together a program for him to execute. The game is a fantastic visualization of programming's simple concept - input\/computation\/output by mapping it onto a little office worker that fetches boxes from an input conveyor belt, varying storage capabilities and comparison operations and a final output coneveyor belt.Each level gives you a different task starting from very simple operations to increasingly more complex mechanics mirroring real-world techniques (pointers, zero-terminated strings anyone?). The tasks itself never feel repetitive, each one is a different challenge in itself. The learning curve is extremely well done and every level is a unique challenge. It just feels perfect in a way that you're never overwhelmed nor bored because of the available mechanics, all the while keeping the problems them simple and short enough to be done in a handful of steps.For people that look for bigger challenges, there are optional side tasks (and they really become challenging), as well as special achievments for solving the regular and optional levels in as few as possible instructions (small program), or in as few as possible steps per input (small runtime).I really find it hard to put into words how excellent this game is.

I hoped for much more.70s programming\/10Edit: As requested in the comments the answer to: \"What would you have added to the game to improve the \"execution\". If you had the opportunity.\" Here is my answer:There are just so many things one could imrove, just for the start you could fix the touch-device centric ui design which results in odd things like being unable to write a comment using your keyboard (instead of using the mouse to draw your text) or the fact you can only see very few lines of your \"code\" at once, most of the screen is just filled with the background picture which doesn't do nothing at all.A further point I do not understand is why the game is sticking with just the most primitive of commands and limitations of assembly throughout the gameplay. Take the task of implementing an algorithm to add two numbers without actually using the \"add\" function, it is fun at first but it would be perfectly ok, to say something like: 'You have unlocked the 'add' command!\" so one could just use it from now on.Or why the hell should I use gotos (aka 'jump to') instead of 'if'-clauses.Or why is it impossible to define functions so i do not have to duplicate my commands all the time.These are the most basic concepts in programming which would allow to introduce much more complex (and fun) tasks to solve instead of just playing assembly code golf.The potential this game could have is nearly endless based on the premise that you are actually just programming using a very low-level language. Gamers with no affinity to programming whatsoever could be introduced to concepts like loops, conditions, functions or even patterns (producer\/consumer pattern would fit perfectly) which could be a good basis to introducing a storyline.Instead this game just feels like a rip-off, I assume it wouldn't take more than few weeks to put this thing together for a skilled game developer.","Also give a thumb up, Great and elegant music and atmosphere make player delight. played all through 43 levels in one day, i found that the game is difficult that it is slightly different from real programming language, making a real programmer little confusing from convensional programming experience,e.g. the instruction list is only limited to MOV ADD SUB JMP JPZ JPN INC DEC, more similar to .net IL than CPU assembly  and a lot of long jumps and no comment code format editing make things really messy, obscure"],["Leave your porgramming skills aside, which are lots of difference with this gameBut NEVER FORGET them as I did this game, QQ","Reminds me of a free game on linux where you have to program movement in a maze, can't remember what it was called.

In the past 25 years I used many assemblers, wrote a lot of C code and learnt the ways of IDA Pro  I think I'm not a too lousy coder myself, yet I'm enjoying HRM. The optimization goals can actually be challenging, and you can always raise your personal bar if it's too easy. Oh, you can also go beyond the game itself, and write your own machine that understands HRM code. Or a compiler that generates HRM code. But I digress, these are not game features, but something you can do on your own if you're really interested.How I would change it? I wish it could accept user-generated levels. Subroutines or library functions, as I mentioned earlier, would be interesting, as well as a stack for recursive code, but then we would soon have a real CPU simulator there, which is probably beyond the scope of a simple game. So let's say it's cool as it is, and user content would be a worthwhile addition. But the real importance of HRM, and the reason I liked it so much, is that It brings back to the world of the living a brief glimpse of the lost art of assembly programming  and I'm quite happy with that.","Pretty okay puzzle game about assembly language. A little short if you are not going for all the optimization challenges.

So I don't know if it will become challenging at that point or if it's too simple for programmers, however, I think it's worth taking a look at for anyone.I believe this game is unique and brings something new to the table.","A great parody of work and programming!","Fun little game if you like programming or logic puzzles. Similiar to the assembly language. I wish there was more advanced levels though.","A great little game that has given me a little insight into what my CPU is up to (it's amazing what you can do with simple instructions, a lot of speed and a large enough memory).","Nice little game, which basically teaches you to do low-level programming. Not sure who this game is targeted for. As a professional programmer I found it fun. I have no idea what non-programmer would think of it. I guess it's something between nice logic puzzle game and weird brain thingy.To sum it up: I like it so I'm giving it thumbs up. If you are not a programmer, don't have any idea what programming is and don't have any interest learning it, it's more than possible you don't like this game. I also wouldn't recommend it for learning programming since low-level isn't really best place to start."],["This may be one of the cleverest introductions to computer science I've ever seen.

Not something you'd probably sit down and knock out all in one go, but definitely a game that you'll keep returning to chip at.","Great game. Lots of levels with a variety of difficulties and the extra challenges really get you thinking outside of the box. Can get frustrating at times, so probably not the best game for a relaxing weekend, but if you want a puzzle type game then this is a great choice."],["Bad programming. Wannabe realistic game.","I thoroughly enjoyed this game! I don't think it's a spoiler to say that gameplay is basically writting simple programs for a basic computer. There's not much plot.I susspect that there are a lot of people out there who like puzzel games, but who would not like this game. Here's a quick checklist to help you decide if you might like this game:You might like this game if...1. you like computer programming in simple languages like C, Basic,  or assebly.2. you love math, in particular algorithms and proofs.3. you care about the process more than the answer.Lastly you may find this game very hard if you're not familliar with a few algorithms like the division algorithm and a simple sorting algorithm like bubble sort.","This game started out as a fun little assembly programming puzzle but got tedious pretty quickly.The story and style are exactly what you'd expect from a 2DBOY \/  Tomorrow Corporation game (World of Goo, Little Inferno). Kind of cute and whimsical, but with a story utterly disconnected from the gameplay without much of a cohesive plot.If you've never done any sort of assembly programming this game could serve as a nice introduction to it; a bit of a  challenge while teaching some of the basics.However, if like me you have done some programming you'll probably find yourself getting annoyed with it pretty quickly. It has:-No boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT, etc.) which seriously limits the scope of what puzzles can be in the game.-No \"branch on positive result\" operator, despite there being negative and zero variants. This doesn't stop you from solving anything, but it forces you into writing some really inelegant solutions in order to work around this pointless omission.-Comments and labels that need to be drawn letter by letter. You aren't required to use them, but if you do hopefully you have good handwriting using a mouse.-No ability to set constants; you have to use whatever the game provides you. This means you pretty much have to solve the problems how they expect you to, no creativity allowed.-A run time that even at the fastest setting will take a few minutes of sitting and waiting for some of the longer puzzles to complete.All in all I think this game fails pretty hard, as its core audience is people with some interest \/ experience in programming but it doesn't respect that audience. It wasn't even all that challenging, I found I spent more time fighting the interface to get my solutions to work than I did actually thinking up solutions."],["Great game!It's really fun to solve the puzzles. If you like logic mind games or ever had fun programming stuff, then this is the game for you!Unfortunately it falls a bit short, took me 4 hours to make 3\/4th of the game and now it gets a little harder.A DLC with new puzzles or maybe a content creater and Workshop Support would be reeeaally great!","DescriptionHuman Resource Machine is a puzzle\/programming game by the devs behind World of Goo and Little Inferno.It makes you code not with the fancy sophisticated constructs of programming languages, but with a very limited set of instructions the likes of which your processor really understands. It is basically a very cute, very graphical introduction to assembler languages and to programming in general.The game starts with simplistic problems and an extremely limited set of instructions, but the difficulty ramps up quite a bit until you finally tackle typical programming problems like Fibonnacci and prime numbers, sorting and so on.Besides all the programming puzzles, the game also tells you a story that I will not dare spoil here, even though it is not, by any means, a story-driven game.Pros Amazingly cute graphics (who woulda thunk assembler code could be so pretty???) Balanced difficulty curve (aside from optional problems and some optimization goals) Good amount of content for the price (unless you are a computing genius... or a cheater)Cons Interface gets frustrating at times Coding complex programs with so few instructions is hard (and now you know why programming languages were invented in the first place ;) )VerdictIf ever a programming game could be accessible to non-coders, this would be it. At the same time, behind its cute graphics and visual gimmicks, it really is a programming game.If you're a coder, you should give this one a try, if only to afterwards go back to your favorite language and sigh in contentment for all the syntactic sugar making your coding experience so much more comfortable.If you've ever wondered how computer actually compute data, this is the game for you.If you're a big fan of puzzles and brain teasers, this will probably give you a headache in a good way.If you fit in none of those categories, I would only advise getting this game on sale, as you might go into anaphylactic shock ;)"],["A simple game, easy to get started with and gets more challenging as you progress. A great way to get kids into programming.","I've been wanting to learn to code for a long time and never got around to it due to the fear and bias most people deal with.With this game I felt engaged, I felt accomplished at every optimization I achieved, I felt like I was learning without the headache.This is a must have for anyone starting out in coding, or simply enjoys a good puzzle game.100% satisfied with purchase."],["This game is way to short and way to easy not worth the 10 dollars in my opinion","Somehow, I got tricked into wiriting assembly code in the guise of a video game.And I'm enjoying it.  Go figure."],["As a programmer, I liked it. Not hard enough to feel like work, not super easy to bore me.Short, and pretty straight forward.For the asked price was pretty much what I expected.","That was a blast! It was quite refreshing to play a less-than-hardcore programming puzzler for once.You new job is at an old-timey skyscraper. Since computers havent been invented yet, the engineers solve problems by running letters and numbers around on tiled floors. Given an inbox full of stuff, your task is to write a small set of instructions that give the bosses exactly what they want, in the precise order they want it.What the game doesnt explicitly tell you is that youre writing some of the simplest useful algorithms in assembly code, such as multiplication, sorting, and alphabetizing, using logic thats very similar to what youd use if you were doing it for real. And its all presented in a clean, responsive interface and Tomorrow Corporations signature creepy cartoon artstyle. It does a wonderful job of presenting the art of writing algorithms as a series of simple, elegant puzzles.And just like Little Inferno and World of Goo, it has an unexpectedly beautiful, haunting soundtrack.I give the game an 8.5 \/ 10. Why the points off? Mainly, its due to the limitations of the interface, some of which are seriously disappointing. Its clear to see that Human Resource Machine was meant to be played on a touchscreen, and it sticks to it to a fault. The only way to comment your code is to write awkward, messy, hand-drawn notes with a paintbrush  you cant type comments at all.  And the code editor itself, while perfect for 90% of the game and its simplistic puzzles, starts to show some frustrating weaknesses as the game pushes the envelope on complexity near the end: theres no zooming, no indenting. You cant bulk select any code, so if you want to duplicate a block, you have to re-create it line by line. If you want to delete a code block, you have to drag every single line away.  Copy\/paste is limited to the entire program at once, which is nearly useless.Some of the problems with the editor can be alleviated because you can copy and paste code into external text editors, but then theres another serious problem: you cant read any of the comments, since theyre encoded as 2-color images. The entire comment system is shamefully awful and deserves an entire point off of a nearly perfect game. Why not allow text input? I mean, most devices with touchscreens also have on-screen keyboards, so whats the big deal?A few other nitpicks:- Steam leaderboards would have been nice.- A few extra puzzles, perhaps about 10, would have been nice. The game only has about 36 of them.- A sandbox mode would have also been nice. Programming games tend to have some hardcore difficulty, requiring nearly just as much planning and effort as a legitimate programming project. Finally, with Human Resource Machine, we have one thats suitable for newcomers. If youre interested in programming puzzles but thought SpaceChem or TIS-100 got too hard, this may just be the game for you. On the other hand, if you already have a background in programming and are looking for a challenge, try getting 100% completion in this game without a guide, and you probably won't be disappointed in the level of difficulty either.","Wow.  I have done programming work as part of my profession, I have a bachelor's in CS, I've been programming for over 20 years, and this game is amazing.Firstly:  If you are new to programming or not even new yet, great!  This game is a great introduction.  Just IGNORE THE OPTIMIZATION MILESTONES.  Focus on finishing all the levels, then you can worry about that.If, however, you are like me a professional programmer at times, this game's optimization challenges can still provide a great challenge.  I just spent what felt like 2 hours (probably more like 1 to 1-and-a-half) trying to optimize the runtime of Level 20 (multiplication) and half the time my program didn't even work correctly, let alone optimally.Protip: The program doesn't end until you go to the Inbox while it's empty.  Doing so before a jump, rather than after, can make the difference in optimizing number of steps taken.  Also, it's not literal steps -- it's number of instructions followed, so which floor mat locations you use doesn't matter.  Jumps count as a step but jump targets do not."],["A fun, open-ended puzzle game. This game is far more approachable than TIS-100 for a few reasons: Player programs in Human Resource Machine advance sequentially and don't have a length limit. Also, the game includes polished music and character animations. Even my non-techy family enjoyed this game.On the other hand, Human Resource Machine is rather short, and its interface is very touch-oriented. I'd recommend playing on a tablet unless the developer adds better keyboard shortcuts.The more difficult puzzles touch on some computer science favorites, including arrays, pointer arithmetic, linked lists, Fibonacci numbers, prime numbers, and sorting. Zachtronics tends to avoid so explicitly referencing computer science fundamentals in its games.","Game make brain hurt D: It's programming. Play if you like programming.","Love this game!

It contains a decent number of levels and offers intuitive mouse-based controls.This game bears comparison even with Zachtronics puzzle games and I enjoyed it very much.","It took me forever to try this game!

Really liked the level of difficulty -- quick and fun to build out an initial implementation, and an interesting challenge to hit all of the optimization thesholds; nothing was too tedious to not be a good time. After hours of playing, I had to find the music volume setting in a config file, in order to disable the single music track and listen to my own music -- aside from that, I think the game was very polished for what it is.

You have to like programming though. Ending was underwhelming.... all of the other videos in the story were great. A little difficult when you had some long programs as scrolling could displace a command and the undo didn't always show what was undone.

It has a pretty shallow difficulty curve, and the machine model is very classical.I'm a veteran of things like SpaceChem and TIS-100, so it only took me about 3 hours to finish this. For somebody new to programming games though, I would expect this game would take more like 10-20 hours.","so many great hours at the office and no payment....","Human Resource Machine is a game where you use a very basic assembly-like instruction set to write simple programs.Each program has a series of inputs, an expected series of outputs, and a limited number of availalbe memory locations where you can store values.  In the begining, you work with solely numerical inputs but later on you have to deal with character manipulation as well.My opinion of this game is a little biased as I program professionally.  I feel like some of the harder puzzles probably take a pretty big leap in difficulty that may prove frustrating for player who are not familiar with certain assembly-level ways of thinking.That being said, I really enjoyed the puzzles, and even though the game isn't terribly long, its a really interesting and unique experience, and I found it worth what I payed just for that.  The challenge objectives can also add some length on to the game with some of the challenges being trickier than even the hardest puzzles normally.Small gripes I had with the game is that the difficulty curve feels all over the place. Sometimes programs are feel really tricky or really trivial compared to those around it and even some of the alternate track levels seemed much easier than those around them.  Also, there is kind of a back story with cutscenes that happen occasionally, but they feel really pointless and kind of take you out of the experience of the game.Ultimately, I recommend this game to people with programming experience looking for some fun little puzzles that require you to take a step back and work within limitations or people who have an interest in programming or learning programming and want some practice in solving those types of problems."],["All that math sent me back to my psychiatrist.","I have finished the main part of this game a few days ago, and it was great, so i thought id be nice to put up a recommendation.First of all, before you look at the store page and disgustedly turn away because theres programming involved, dont worry about that. You need no prior programming knowledge to understand and play this game, nor do you need any of it to have fun with it.However, there are two \"courses\" in the game, plus a bonus challenge:-The regular, linear puzzle path that starts at a difficulty of \"add these numbers together and send the result. You did it!\"-The more advanced puzzle path that actually needs a lot of thinking and planning to grasp and finish. There are some really hard puzzles here, even if you did some programming in your free time.-There are also some optimization challenges, However, be aware: those are *REALLY DIFFICULT*. I was only able to optimize the first third of the game, and after that, i found myself blankly staring at my screen for 10 minutes, wondering how i ended up with 20 commands instead of 5.So basically there are three types of people that would enjoy this game, based on the two paths and the bonus:1. People that enjoy logic puzzles and doing cool things with numbers. AKA people that would enjoy any other puzzle game just as much.2. People that not only like solving logic puzzles but also are interested in programming in general; The way of thinking that would usually help you solve a coding problem will also help you here. Also do try this path if youre type 1; The game might convince you to go on.3. Mad insane people that want to get the best results humanly possible and strive for maximum efficiency. This game will consume your life and stay in your head until you beat the requirement for optimization. This is a last warning. It is not too late to turn back.That being said, the logic curve is really gentle; the first third of the game operates on knowledge that a preschooler would have. So yeah, dont worry. Even the final puzzle of the main path was not that hard to conquer. With enough time and the will to not give up, you will be able to solve the whole thing easily. This is not a crazy Zachtronics game where halfway through the game your brain explodes in a billion shreds and you regret everything. It's actually quite a relaxing experience. And for 10, it would be silly not to try and give it a go.Positive things:The graphics and soundtrack are lovingly crafted, the game eases you into the more difficult puzzles, and unless youre going for 100% efficiency, just solving the whole thing wont be too much of a hassle. Although this might not be a casual game, it does not involve any crazy mental hoola-hoops just to have fun with it, unlike something akin to TIS-100. TIS-100 is the kind of game that will inevitable make you feel like youre the most stupid human on planet earth. (However, if you are smart enough, which im not, TIS-100 will give you just what you need)This game will make you feel smart while also being an actual fun game you will want to sink your free time into.Negative things:The programming language youre given is the most low-level thing ever. You are given very basic mathematical operations throughout the whole game. This might work for what the game asks of you, but i feel like if the thing progressed more and gave you more high-level programming stuff to work with, you would be able to ask much more cool and interesting things; as a result of the kind of programming you use, even the hardest challenges seem bland. Even the hardest thing in the enire game - finding prime factors - still is a basic task. The only hard part is that youre only given subtraction, addition, and memory management, so in the end it feels like carving a statue out of stone with your bare hands. Which just isnt fun. Other games like spacechem make difficult tasks feel exciting and cool, this one not so much.Also the UI is a bit slow sometimes.In the end, even if it doesnt look like it, the games really cool! I definetly recommend it if you have any interest in puzzle games whatsoever. Go play it! The positives outweigh the nitpicks i have by a lot, and the 12 hours i spent with it were a lot of fun.

You get achievements and such for optimal solutions but it is not a requirement.The only con on this game is that it is fairly short if you are coming from a game like TIS-100 you can probably complete this in a day.

I love the fact that you learn some real bit logic\/math used by real microprocessors.

And there are actually two criteria to work on, depending on what you need more (that is, what your hardware limits you to).This game gives you a bunch of mostly trivial tasks (starting from \"pass input to output\" and up to \"calculate prime factors for each given number\") and asks you to \"instruct\" yourself in how to solve them (which is basically equivalent to writing a program in a very limited version of Assembly  about a dozen most primitive operations). Initially you only have \"input\" and \"output\" operations, but you'll get a new operation whenever it's needed for solving the task at hand. After you reach the first \"milestone\", you'll be introduced to the optimization challenges  \"preferred\" length and average run time values for your programs (personally, I found that moving the last part of a loop body before its beginning is a surprisingly effective technique). You'll also get \"optional\" branches with more interesting (but also trickier) problems to solve; though the main branch also gets quite tricky later on (I found it quite funny, that on the last problem, whenever I tried optimising for time, I somehow ended up also reducing program size, on every step).In short, it's a neat game with several hours worth of fun brain exercise, that also makes you struggle with doing simple things enough to appreciate the fact that no one actually has to (and definitely shouldn't) program this way for at least half a century."],["Good A great puzzle game to get you thinking like a developer.","Excellent for touch screen e.g. my Surface Pro 4.

Props to the developers for taking low-level programming concepts and turning it into an interactive gaming experience. This game has immense potential, but ended up leaving me disappointed by the end. Past about level 20, the game became dull. I love the animation style and game concept, but the puzzles just became cumbersome to optimize instead of difficult. The commenting feature is pretty unusable, as you can't type comments, only draw them with the mouse, and more complex problems were annoying to step through or run multiple times. The pain of trying to optimize with poor comments and a drag-and-drop interface made the game lackluster for me. That style of command interface and comments would work best with less intensive puzzles and weighed it down. Overall, great concept, atmosphere, and design to a point. However, in the latter half of the game, the design doesn't work as well. This game is still adorable and worth your time, but I want to be clear that it does have its drawbacks.","Coming from a programming background, this game is quirky and makes you think. I highly recommend it to anyone regardless if they know anything about programming.","tl;dr2: Don't read this review and just buy TIS-100 instead, it's infinitely superior in every way possible and completely blows this game out of the water.tl;dr: the reason only 3% of players have the \"Green Optimization Award\" achievement isn't because the game is hard, but because the game becomes unplayable in the end.This is a good programming puzzle game that is badly let down by some trivial, but intensely irritating, flaws. I actually don't want to leave a negative review, but I can't ignore its glaring problems. Since the positive reviews outnumber the negative ones, I'm leaving this review to add some constructive criticism.Programmers will breeze through the puzzles in no time, about a single-digit number of hours to complete. The game only gets interesting when you try the optional optimization challenges (get your program under a certain size or speed). Programmers need to do these optional challenges otherwise there is no point in even playing this game. They are interesting challenges, but they're also where things go bad: the bad UI makes things unplayable. Here's why:1) You can add comments to you code, as well as labelling memory locations...but it's done in the most annoying way possible. You don't type in your comments with the keyboard, instead you \"write\" with the mouse. Oh, and the field you get to draw\/write into is very small, and the pen you draw\/write with is very thick, so you can barely write anything. A comment such as \"P is prime\" hardly fits. Really infuriating. I've seen some awful programming environments, but this is the first one I've seen that actively discourages you from commenting your code.2) The maximum program run speed is far too slow for some of the more advanced optimization challenges. One of the puzzles will take 3:30 to run at max speed (although you can get it down to about 2:20 when you optimize it). That's too long, and will become an unnecessary test of your patience.This isn't a petty complaint. Let's put that 3:30 into perspective. 3:30 means you can only run your solution 17 times an hour. That's 3:30 of waiting, maybe about 20 seconds to apply a fix, then another 3:30 to see if it worked. Rinse, repeat, get frustrated. That means you can only try about 15 things (trivial stuff like small fixes) an hour, so that particular puzzle becomes dragged out to a ludicrously painful extent. You spend a lot of time just waiting for the puzzle to run, and hardly any time working on your solution. Imagine if your favourite IDE did that. You get the picture.As an aside, that particular puzzle also trolls you by supplying the single-item list as the final input (after the 10 item list that accounts for most of the 3:30 runtime), so if you have a bug that happens with the list-of-only-one-item (an edge case, that's why they test for it) then you're going to have to wait 3:30 for that bug to appear, then additional multiples of 3:30 to test each of your fixes.3) Dragging and dropping program instructions is needlessly laborious. The maximum HRM program length is 255 lines (although I think the longest HRM program I wrote is about 70 lines). Let's just say, without spoiling anything, you **might** get near the 255 line limit while trying to solve some of the optimization challenges. That's a lot of dragging and dropping! If you double click an instruction the game appends it at the bottom, which isn't helpful as most of the time you are likely to be working on an inner loop. Instead of adding it to the bottom, double clicking should have inserted the instruction after the last one you added. That would have been a big improvement.These complaints may sounds trivial, but they aren't. The big optimized programs have lots of jumps, etc and it quickly turns into a mess of spaghetti code (that's ok, it's just what happens with asm code). You can only see about 16 lines of code at a time, so it becomes very easy to lose track of things. You could add some labels, but the labels are painful to add! You're bound to make mistakes as a result of the UI, and then the UI punishes you for those mistakes by making you to wait 3:30. Now you see how the game itself becomes the biggest problem. These problems only start to make themselves apparent when doing the optimization challenges. At that point you have to wonder why you're even bothering with HRM. You can find loads of programming challenges\/golf\/puzzles out there, just do one of those instead in your favourite development environment where you can add comments with your keyboard, don't have to wait 3:30 for a trivial program to run, and you can see more than 16 lines of code at a time. Go pick something off Project Euler instead, and challenge yourself mentally instead of challenging your patience or your ability to draw text with the mouse.A saving grace is that HRM supports copying and pasting programs. It's often less frustrating to copy your code into Notepad, work there, and copy it back into HRM. Shame the comments\/labels don't go across in a way that's readable, but that's because they're mouse strokes not text."],["This is an awesome game! Yet so simple.If you're a programmer - by day or night, this game is for you. If you're not, after playing this game you will be - or at least have the skills to become one.This game is about writing lists of instructions to get your cute little office worker to achieve certain tasks. Plenty of amusing, desaturated graphics and cutscenes, and an upbeat soundtrack keep things light and funny while you decide how to get your employee to achieve the tasks set before him.This game starts out super easy and then builds to being a challenge even for the seasoned, persistent, puzzle solver. It also has several fun achievements to go back for after you complete the basic levels (or if you need a break from the straight forward puzzle solving).Of course, the flip side to that is *this game is a long series of puzzles.* If you don't like solving puzzle after puzzle, this game is not for you. There are breaks to keep things interesting and avoid monotony, but it still boils down to just a lot of puzzle solving.However, if you're on the fence, give it a shot. There's no long intro or steep learning curve so worst case scenario is you play it for an hour and you find out you don't like it and return it. Best case scenario is you have a BLAST and maybe develop skills you didn't even know you could develop.P.S. If you're looking to get into programming, software development, etc., buy this game now! It will help you develop (or test) the skills you'll need in that field while having some fun.I think this game should be in every elementary school computer lab - it's that good at developing programming skills without being boring.","Really entertaining game!Being an actual developer, the game is quite easy and the drag-and-drop might appear a bit cumbersome. Nevertheless, it has the same spirit as TIS-100 or Shenzhen I\/O, but is far more accessible to beotians. Therefore, I recommend buying it if you are kinda new to programming, just to make low-level commands fun!","Definitely not a game for everyone. Definitely a game for me :-)","Easier than Shenzhen I\/O.","The best training course for the weirdest assembler so far!"],["Quite fun! If you have any sort of background in programming, this game should be pretty interesting to you. If not, it's a great way to learn the basics (of the basics). Starts off easy, but some of the later levels are quite difficult, and the Optimization Challenges really up the difficulty sometimes. Also has a stunning soundtrack and humor sprinkled throughout (just World of Goo and Little Inferno which were made by at least part of this dev team).There are several negative reviews in here talking about how some aspects of the game (particularly commenting and evaluation speed) are laborious or not user-friendly, but I feel like they're kinda missing the point. This game is not meant to be a full-fledged, highly-optimized IDE; it's a silly game with a silly aesthetic and those aforementioned \"problems\" are part of that aesthetic. The setting and dialogue of this game is clearly set in the past (however long ago, I don't know; I don't really know the history of programming very well) as indicated by the old-fashioned character outfits and mail tubes and the basic numerical operations and background story of machines taking over. You don't play this game to write professional software or learn a new programming language or experience a state-of-the-art rendition of the latest programmatical advances, you do it for the fun of solving the game's challenges. Part of those challenges is working within the constraints of the game and its stricter Optimization Challenges.By all means, take all the reviews into consideration, but remember this is a game first and a programming environment second.","I like logical puzzle games. I kinda liked human resource machine but eventually stopped for only one reason:Everyone who's programming at least a bit knows good code is primarily readable code. This game however doesn't let me write readable code. The way the code is presented is confusing. I feel like spending more time understanding my code than actually solving the puzzle.","nice math game.","A wonderful puzzling game with the charm that one would expect from the creator of World Of Goo and Little Inferno (both also awesome games)."],["I'm a big fan of these programming style games, particular Spacechem. As these games are currently both 6.99 I will be drawing a lot of comparisons between the two.HRM isn't a BAD game. I certainly enjoyed it for most of the time I played it. It's very open with the coding aspect, where as games like Spacechem and Infinifactory disguise their programming so users don't realise they're doing it, HRM feels more like an educational game.The UI is the main problem with the game. There is no form of copy and paste, the insertable comments are obnoxiously large and you can only see a small portion of the more complicated programs meaning doing the optimization challenged can be very frustrating. A minor note is the game forgets whether you muted it or not so you have to remute it every time you start it up. You can also only mute it from within one of the levels.The game is also very bare. 41 levels, each with two optimisation challenges but if you have some experience with these kinds of games you'll complete both challenges with your first solution on 80% of the levels. That's it. There's no sandbox, no bonus missions, no other stages, no Steam Workshop. That's your lot. I thought the game might expand, perhaps adding additional workers or additional rooms but it doesn't.Spacechem has 53 story missions, many of which consist of multiple \"rooms\", 3 bonus missions and an additional 255 Research Net missions.I can't recommend HRM for either experienced programmers or newcomers to this excellent genre. It feels more like a free flash game than a title worth 6.99.","Very addictive game. Experienced software engineers will likely find the first 30-35 or so levels fairly easy to beat, and fairly easy to optimize for both instruction count and time complexity. Unlocking 100% acheivments is challenging, though. Those last few puzzles took some time to think through. Nice little game!"],["I really enjoyed this game so far (completed the story-levels, but not all optional levels). It's a puzzle game where each possible step to solving a Puzzle is an assembler command in disguise.The UI is very friendly at the beginning, but as others have already stated: In the later levels its hard to keep the overview. I guess adding comments and variable names by drawing with the mouse was to have the same UI for touch-devices. Harder to use, but still usable.In conclusion: I really enjoyed this game and really had a hard time putting it down.","I am torn whether to recommend this game or not. I encourage you to look at some gameplay videos first. And I recommend buying it only in deep sale. The reason I am torn is because it's a nice concept and video games are a great way to introduce people to programming. But the implementation isn't up to par.  As a software engineer who loves coding, I find this game utterly annoying. Programming in the real world is much easier for the same level of complexity.  Basically, this game gives you items in your inbox (the input set) and each level gives you instruction on what to do with those items. And once you're done what you're asked to do, you have to put the results (output) in the outbox. Sounds like a fun idea and the game is fun, at least initially. But as you progress to higher levels, the flaws in the game starts to overshadow the fun part of the game and a fun programming puzzle game turns into a frustrating and tedious chore. One of the most glaring problems of this game is not letting us set breakpoints, which would have made life so much easier! When you're writing a lengthy program in the real world, and you think there is a problem (bug) in your program at a certain point, you can set a breakpoint there and the program will stop when it reaches that particular point. So now you can continue investigating where the problem is. But in this game you can't do that. So if you're trying to find out any problems in your program, you have to click on the \"next step\" button till you get to the step where the problem happens. This was a minor annoyance in the beginning but as the program becomes longer it becomes a big headache. The second most annoying flaw of the game is when you stop your program, it scrambles the input set. So now if you made any progress in figuring out where the problem lies, you have to throw it out the door and start anew because in this new set you will face problems at a different point. When you program, you can debug using the same inputs till you figure out the problem but here you can't. Again, initially not a problem but as the level of complexity of the programs increase, it becomes unbearable. These are just two of the many problems. The game doesn't even let you use conditional statements, another thing that makes life of a programmer a lot easier. If you don't have experience programming, then rest assured real life programming is much easier than playing this game. The tools available to you as a programmer makes your life much easier and those aren't available in this game. There are many levels which are really fun so it is worth getting it on sale."],["Tomorrow corporation's style and sense of humor are present in full-force, and the game is graphically appealing, however it sadly falls short of its apparent goal of being a Zachtronics game.The inflexibility of drag-and-drop programming and hand-drawn labels in a desktop game only add to the confusion and awkwardness of a language that manages in only a few instructions to feel like a blend of the worst aspects of assembly and a turing tarpit of some kind. Drag-and-drop programming is unfortunate even in high-level systems like Scratch, but dragging assembly instructions from a bin is a tedium that no one with a keyboard attached to their PC needs to feel.","The game is quite fun if you like assembly, instructions are fairly limited so it can be quite a challenge. The only thing I dislike about the game is dragging instructions instead of typing them."],["First, I generally like programming games. And in the genre, this one brings a unique perspective that might seem positive at first glance. The simple graphics and the approach to animating the algorithm in progress certainly would seem to allow for the game to be a good introduction to programming for younger players. The programming puzzles themselves start fairly basic, which again seems like a good teaching mechanic.But that perspective is completely undermined by the story, which revolves around a bored, and boring, lifetime employee of an unforgiving corporation. The work undertaken by this employee is meaningless, futile, and despite the efforts of the game designers to add Office Space-style dark humor, horribly depressing. The clear message to younger players is that this is the corporate life facing them if they take up programming. There is a hint of a side plot in cut scenes, but it never adds up to anything.For players who already know programming, the puzzles become hard enough at some point to become interesting, but they don't have any cognitive connection to the earlier puzzles - the solutions don't build on each other. So it feels like a hard cliff dividing those that know programming from those that don't. In addition, the harder puzzles become very annoying to solve because of the interface, which doesn't allow for typed input even for things like labels. Copying and pasting into an actual text editor, then copying and pasting back, is possible, but extremely annoying.In summary, the game falls short due to some fundamental design decisions. It's unfortunate because the game has some promise. But it would take a reworked main storyline, redesigned UI, and puzzle rebalancing pass for it to reach its full potential."],["We've had opportunity to unleash HRM on a range of different experience levels and everyone has enjoyed it.  I had the pleasure of watching a 14 year old, never exposed to programming before, write a sequence reverser in about 30 seconds.  I've watched groups discuss what cards the employee will be carrying at each point and what order the instructions should go in.  I've even stayed up late trying to get all the optimisation challenges!It's a fairly comprehensive game - you get 42 challenges.  There's a little bit of story as you climb the corporate ladder, which breaks up the game nicely.The language you program in is quite simple, but I was impressed that it covered indirection.  You can read from offsets on the carpet.  Also, because you're dragging instructions around, there's no way to write an invalid program.  All programs run, they just might not do anything useful.  You can label variables and instructions, too.In terms of being an introduction to thinking like a programmer (in the small), it feels about right.  Unlike some of the other games, there are no bizzare restrictions that exist to give you 70's nostalgia, your programs can be as long as you like and you usually have some scratch space.  The values are typed, and you will be told off if you overflow, or try to subtract a letter from a number.","It gets quite difficult as you progress."],["A thoroughly enjoyable introduction to assembly code for those unfamiliar, and an artistic challenge even for those who have written their own compilers.Also, listening to the excellent soundtrack I lose track of time."],["Very funny game!

My biggest gripe with this game is that you have to do adding but there's no tag for adding like there's a \"Jump if 0\" \"Jump if negative\" however at the multiplication level there's you having to do things like 9 times 7 with only the ability to copy and paste numbers to 1 of 10 slots.  If you can handle a lot of dedication go for it this game will take up days of your life figuring things out on your own.

The code structure itself reminds me of the Basic coding language, though the commands aren't the same names (GOTO is called JUMP, and there is an arrow you use to indicate where). Other than the coding stuff (which is completely taught to you in-game, so you don't have to already know it), it is also just a really good puzzle game, with \"optimization\" challenges that push you to not just solve the puzzle, but to have the best possible solution.

But in terms of gameplay, nothing comes to mind, it's pretty unique.PlotYou start at the bottom of corporate ladder and you need to solve puzzles to move up. It's not a plot-driven game, so that's really all there is to it. Look...Very similar to World of Goo and Little Inferno. It's pretty and cartoon-ish, with a dark twist. The tasks, the menus, and the available set of tools are clear and easy to understand.... and FeelMostly it's just efficient for what it is. You instantly know what you need to do on each level and what tools are available to do it. Figuring out how to actually do it is the difficult part. MusicCompletely insignificant. It's there in the background, but the authors must've known it's nothing special, because on every level there's a big button to turn it off. I ended up playing other music instead. GameplayThis is the good part! It's about solving puzzles. Programming puzzles. Creating a set of instructions that will process input data and generate correct outputs specific to each assignment. There are some basic tools that you can use - add, subtract, jump, copy, etc. At the beginning it's simple, just to get you familiar with what's available and how it all works. But then it gets to the juicy bits. And it gets difficult. Very difficult. But was good fun trying to figure it out, even if my brain hurt sometimes. ConclusionIt's a very good game. Especially if you're into programming, then you should consider it a personal challenge.But don't judge this game just by looking at screenshots. They don't give it justice.

Those would take 8 billion humans to understand and you are just One. One productive happy worker, right?","Human Resource Machine is a small game about programming. It offers some really tough challenges for even those who code for a living, using only the simplest( aaand a bit outdated) programming concepts.You have a bus, and an array with a specific size in each level. You can use basic commands to read an index from that array into your bus, or write that bus into an index within your array. You can read, write, add, subtract, increment and decrement. You can read your input into your bus, and write your bus onto the output. Every operation is done with your bus. Your task is to take input from the inbox conveyor, process it according to the protocol provided with each level, and output the result onto the outbox conveyor. As simple as that. But it is always worth it and results in extreme satisfaction when I nail the solution. (Joy of Thinking)In the game, you climb this enormous office building, slowly progressing through more and more complicated tasks, and small cutscenes that tell a fun story about three of your colleges, mostly during \"coffee break\". All three of which ignore the news on the TV where you will see the city slowly turning into a world where machines do all the work.The third \"era\" in this game is the most exciting. After a dramatic cutscene, your bosses tell you that big changes are coming. It is a plot twist. The story takes a very sharp turn. At the same time, you unlock the last, and most powerfull upgrade in your arsenal of commands. One that really changes everything.In the case you were wondering, amongst the toughest challenges offered are sorting, prime factoring, and duplicate filtering. They are hard because of the lack of memory space, and the lack of control over the flow of your code. You don't just have to know programming, you need to master it. You can only branch your code by testing if your bus is zero or negative, so subtract to compare numbers. If you fail, the game laughs at you, your boss at his desk get mad( as errors), and you can feel very clueless about some of the mistakes you made. I am talking about my Father who teaches C++ in university. Unlike me, it took him one hour to give up on writing a code for the prime factoring level. He was overwhelmed by a simple math puzzle for which I wrote a (not OCD) code in ten minutes, fixing it up to be fully optimal in about 20 extra minutes.I let more than one person other than myself try the game, and surprisingly enough, they mostly failed near halfway through. They got stuck in different levels, but to the point that they are \"guessing\" when they modify their code. They recognise, say that they put a specific command in the wrong place, but they \"guess\" when they try to move it elsewhere. Some told me that they don't even know what their code is doing anymore. It's like not being able to read your own writing.A lot of negative reviews complain about the fact that the tools are not powerfull. They are half wrong. It makes for a great challenge, but yes, it can be frustrating if you can't part with your precious \"for\" loops, and advanced mathematical operations for the sake of the game. After all, in a game of optimisation puzzles, multiplication and division are way overpowered the same way something else can be owerpowered and decrease the fun the player has in a lot of games. Developers tend to make the most optimal way to play the most fun.And then there are the Optimal Completion Distinction (AkA: OCD) challenges. There are two for each level if you are really into programming. There is the size challenge, which you complete by staying under a given number of lines. And the speed challenge, which is the \"average number of steps\" your worker has to take, tested against a number of deterministically generated inputs.And here is what I dislike about this game:-Incorrect and sometimes misleading translation( at least, to my native language). First playthrough was in english, then I switched to my native language which is rarely supported in games."],["This game is both a very good puzzle game and a decent intro to programming game.  Don't get this if you're really that much into coding, because there's a lot better out there, as this will come off as spaghettified solutions since that's the only way you can really program, but if you're just wanting a good puzzler and a visual tool for programming, this game is perfect.  Highly recommend.","The game is alright, but just feels inferior to TIS-100 (despite having a far more welcoming interface).  It seems like the game was designed for mobile devices: everything is drag-and-drop, to the point that you never use your keyboard at all.  My biggest irritation here is that you have absolutely no data literals: if you need a zero, you have to grab a zero from somewhere in the puzzle's memory.  You start with a very basic set of instructions that does grow over time, but the list never grows to more than what fits comfortably on the screen.  Your programs are typically between 8-15 lines long, and while there are a few levels near the end that get into the 20's, that's still a pretty short line count for a programming puzzle.  I finished the game feeling like my solutions probably look very, very similar to everyone else's.All in all, if you're trying to decide between this game and TIS-100, I'd recommend TIS-100.

But it's easy to get past that since most of the game focuses on the 42 years you spend holed up in the office building.The soundtrack is nothing to bark at. For the most part it's ominous and quite fitting to the plot of the game. The title screen music is a nice, dance-able swing\/folk-y track with an old-timey aesthetic that really does a good job at getting you pumped to tear your hair out figuring out how to sort a set of strings in 39 lines of code and 25 units of memory.As you progress through the game, more and more instructions are added to your instruction set. Starting with just \"input\" and \"output\", and slowly blossoming into a satisfyingly complex set of eleven instructions. As you play, the game quickly turns into an optimization game kind of like Zachtronics' TIS-100. I.e. you'll have to optimize for code size and for time complexity. Some puzzles are not possible to optimize for both, so you'll have to make separate solutions sometimes. Most of the time, the time complexity challenge is a simple matter of hard-coding every step while keeping it general enough that it's still robust (it can handle any input within the spec and function properly). There's an achievement for hard-coding a solution for a specific set of inputs, by the way.One thing that game does NOT make clear is that the little tabs at the top of the code editor are in fact tabs for three different solutions. So that's nice to know.It's also helpful to think of your guys' hands as an Accumulator Register. This will make instructions like SUB easier to reason about.The editor also has copy\/paste, which puts, in your clipboard, a file with a game-specific header containing your program. So you can edit it in an actual text editor if the Scratch-like interface starts to wear on your wrist.The editor also has labels, for giving symbolic names to specific floor spaces, and code comments, which help tremendously with organizing and spacing out your code, but--this is where I seriously disagree with the game--it takes way too long to gain the ability to use these features. For probably a third of the game, you are forced to write spaghetti code that can and will turn into a stupidly complex mess. The game gets INTENSE after the halfway point. If you aren't already a programmer, you're going to go mad doing this. Granted, it's not as tough as MHRD, but it's still tough. The last ten-or-so levels REALLY gave me a run for my money.Oh, there's also this subplot about robots taking over the world. It's none of your concern, however. You have work to do, and the boss is watching!Overall, it's a good game.","It feels like the homework I'd have loved doing for my CS classes, only mostly easier.

Fibonacci sequence,ranking from the smallest to the biggest , etc.Solving these problems just made me remember that time when i was sitting in front of the computer, staring at the celling,trying to figure out the most effective algorithm,until i realized it took only a few lines of codes.Programming can never be tedious.Think of it as working on a math problem.As you can imagine the sense of achievement of coming out the solution that no one else in the class has thought of yet.The theory was tested correct when i learned from people who are working with the codes, are also good at math when they were or before receiving higher education .Though math can be very difficult sometimes, therefore i was never good at it , actually i haven't been in touch with math for many years after linear algebra and calculus.Like anything else in the world, math and programming require creativity and imagination, those are two things i lack of the most ,i think.So,for players who are interested in programming or currently learning or simply wanting to exercise their brains , this game could be a good start.     Besides you will learn more about the concept of pointer in a less abstract way later in game.And of course if it becomes difficult,HRM community guides provide with some insightful hints. You can always look it up for some ideas.","I love it! the mechanics made me learn code. the storyline is fun also.","It is a funny game which is too difficult for me . So I am going to advice player who has a clear mind or is good at programmely thinking method to try it .

I thought TIS-100 was THE game for assembly code geeking out, but now I see there's multiple valid ways to make such a game. TIS-100 has a number of constraints that make it very difficult, and often very convoluted, where in Human Resource Machine, there is a beautiful simplicity from which compliexity grows naturally.  I have to say, I prefer Human Resource Machine, and perhaps when I'm complete, I'll go back to TIS-100 and be better able to complete some tasks.The problems themselves are often fairly straightforward to solve (at least early on), but achieving the bonuses are another matter entirely.  But by the time I got to the end of creating an assembly program which parsed numbers into 100s 10s, and 1s, I fully understood what my program was doing, and was able to see into the mechanics of how computers compute in a way that I never fully have before. The representation of memory is really simple and fascinating - I found myself creating a kind of For Loop in assembly code, without having been taught it. When things are laid out as they are here, solving problems in this way becomes an enjoyable journey of discovery.Definitely recommend this. While I'm a programmer, this may even be a good way to introduce concepts to non-programmers. You won't even need to tell them they are programming!","This is a great game for programming students and enthusiasts but not as meaningful as Little Inferno or World of Goo. Human Resource Machine has a well designed learning curve but is overall less challenging compared to Zachtronics programming puzzle games (take that as a positive or negative). You start off with just a few commands and earn more commands in later levels. The puzzles are varied nicely and even though you build up your problem solving repetoire over time, it never feels repetetive. There are minor hints at times but it is just enough information to get your brain headed on the right track. If you find the main missions a little too easy there are optional challenges that are more difficult (I just finished the main puzzles and I'm looking forward to completing the extras as well). As a final note, although the setting is unconventional for this kind of programming puzzle game, it is entertaining to see your character running around executing the code you write.","This game is perfect for logic thinkers.","I like the game.

For me that was within 2 hours. There's some gameplay value after that: the secondary puzzles are (a bit) harder, and you can optimize yours solutions to meet additional goals, but the game feels too small for me.I'd recommend the game if it had a lot more puzzles and\/or significantly harder puzzles.

World of Goo was one of the first games I bought on Steam, and really enjoyed Little Inferno as well.Human Resource Machine takes assembly level programming and simplifies it.

While it doesn't say so, it is teaching the basics of assembly language programming, at least as they were during the 8 bit era.The difficulty of the game comes not from the problems being solved, but from the fact that the mind cannot hold on to too  many details at once, such as which memory location (floor patch) holds the true value, or where multiple different branch commands are going, especially when they cannot share labels.Commenting is very difficult because it is done by *drawing* with the mouse, not by typing.  Only a handful of commands fit vertically on the screen, and jumps are represented by arrows (which take up a line on the screen for the target location), and comments are very very large.  This means that only a little bit of program is visible at once.So the real challenge is more keeping track of things than solving actual problems.","Amazing gameI love the challenges, the art style and humour of the gameI played every single game from Tomorrow Corporation and I was never dissapointed","I feel like I'm learning programming.A headache from frustration never felt so good.8\/10 do recommend with painkillers.

A funny little game which teaches some nice basics of programming in an intuitive and interesting way."],["If there were an option for \"It depends...\" I would have chosen that. While I certainly enjoyed figuring out these puzzles, this game is definitely for a niche audience.All of the puzzles are math and logic based, and if you are the type of person who needs a calculator to figure out what a fifteen percent tip equals, or you would find yourself in the middle of nowhere if you had to read a map and couldn't use GPS, this is not the game for you. If, however, you are like me and found \"Intro to Programming\" one of the easiest courses in college, you'll probably have fun playing this game.The first dozen or so levels are easy enough that nearly everyone should be able to pass them fairly quickly, but the difficulty does ramp up. In one (optional) level, the game expects the player to have a basic understanding of the Fibonacci sequence, While it does give the player a very, very short explanation of the sequence, it says that we should just look it up. It also says this about zero terminated strings. I even had to research bubble sorting in order to complete a couple of levels.While I had fun completing this game, I think the middle to later parts of the game will just become frustratingly maddening for most people, and they will feel like this is more akin to homework than a game.Also, this game was obviously developed for mobile devices, which makes one part of the game truly awkward to play: writing notes. For people who do enjoy programming or scripting, they know that making notes is vital in understanding what code is meant to do what. And because this game was designed for tablets and such, the only way to make notes is to write freehand on a small piece of virtual masking tape. I spent much more time than anyone should have to spend condensing my thoughts into two or three words, then trying to write those words legibly with my mouse.Finally, the cut scenes are meant to be witty, but I just found them to be cynical and nihilistic.So, if you are looking for a decently challenging math\/logic puzzler that can entertain you for a weekend, give this game a try. Otherwise, give it a pass.","All optimizations completed.

It drives algorithmic thinking but still does require a lot of math as you move from mathematical operations to sorting and others. Definitely not for everyone. While the first half is easy to keep track of the later half often bombards you with many JUMP statements, especially if you want like to finish both challenges. The two challenges for all levels are speed (the least amount of steps) and size (the least amount of commands used).  It helped that I knew most of these problems from school\/college already. But still, this game could be a useful tool in teaching algorithmic thinking. There is also a strange short story in the background of things given via cinematics. This connects it to the same universe of the other Tomorrow Corporation games (Little Inferno, 7 Billion Humans,...). There's a bit too simple user interface. To change the language you have to right click on the game in the Library, go to the Language tab and choose there. There are no display options except for toggling full screen.  The soundtrack si fun to listen to and fits the style of the game well. However, you cannot turn off menu\/elevator music, only the music in a level itself. Sounds cannot be turned off in game at all (you have to go to Windows volume control options). Feels like they had a good idea but the implementation is too minimalistic and basic. From the UI to the way commands are put together it becomes a chore sometimes to keep up with the JUMP arrows. Especially for the step\/speed challenges you will end up with a huge bunch of jumps you need to keep track of and not even labels make it easy. So even though I met most of these problems before I still struggled to keep track in many of the programs. That being said, the game is really cool and worth a try. I can easily recommend the first half while I believe the second one will also find its fans. Take a piece of paper though as you will probably need it to write down the logical process. Also, the sequel 7 Billion People has more advanced programming commands and more improvements so you might want to check that out as well.P.S.: The official soundtrack is available for FREE in \"..\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Human Resource Machine\\soundtrack\".------------------------------------------------------------------If you liked this review you can find more on the Curator page or in my Review Corner.","Human Resource Machine is a brilliant game to learn and understand the basics of programming.

It starts out slow by introducing one new command each level as you \"write\" basic lines of code to create simple programs that complete the level's tasks.  All this is done with an easy to understand drag and drop system that couldn't be simpler.  After you've unlocked most of the commands the difficulty really starts to ramp up and you'll have to dip into some of your math\/algebra knowledge to solve the levels, or you can simply use trial and error to eventually come to a solution.  I don't really have any programming background, but I've always been interested and this game has piqued my interest even more.  The logicality of it all really speaks to me.  If you're already well versed in any kind of programming language this game might not offer up much of a challenge, but that's just a guess really.  You might see my low amount of hours on the game and wonder why I think I can give a fair review.  The reason for that is that I played this game a bunch at a friend's house before purchasing it for myself.  I believe I made it about 2\/3 of the way through.  Graphics and sound are really not that important to a game like this, but both are charming and enjoyable.  Every game I've played by this developer has been similarly engaging and a pleasant experience.  The two I've played are World of Goo and Little Inferno, and I look forward to playing 7 Billion Humans (a sequel of sorts to Human Resource Machine, I believe) after I complete this game.  One last thing I'll say is that I love how the progression works.  There are multiple solutions to each level and finding any of them will allow you to continue to the next, but the game challenges you to find the most efficient solution for added replay value.  There are also side paths that contain more challenging levels if you really get into it.  It is nice though that you don't HAVE to complete these more difficult levels to continue progressing.  All in all I really don't have anything bad to say about this game; just make sure you know what you're getting before you buy it.

The language is made up and is modelled after assembly of rather basic archtecture. Not modern one, something with just few simple instruciton. Reminded me of when I fiddled with MOS Technology 6502. Well, rather, I tried to do some Atari 2600 programming just to learn few low-level things but it felt like hitting a brick wall repeatly because A2600 architecture has no video buffer so you have to \"chase the beam\" and send commands to change values just as it's drawing something on screen if you want anything fancy, such as a normal sprite, because it's otherwise pretty much 8x1 sized sprite stretched vertically. Should have started with C64.Er, wait, what am I talking about? Anyway, yea, it's primitive. No stack, no function to call and return from, no interrupts, it's all just a basic single linear algorithm. Some say that it's like a Turing Machine or Little Man something. Sadly, I know barely anything. Heard but never seriously studied so I would prefer not to discuss those.So yea, a bit low-level, representing it. The tiles on floor are RAM that can hold value and a single person who interacts with RAM locations and holds value itself is a register. Accumulator registers. Because CPUs usually have these few memory slots with which they do basically everything and then store value into RAM and load something else, those are registers. There are few strange things in representation however. In this game you can't interact with empty tiles. Which is actually how proper programming should work, just mind that in reality there is no such thing as empty RAM on low-level, just \"undefined\". We just launched computer and have no idea what was the previous state of those so we better put in some value, like zero, there first. Now, a really strange thing is how register loses it's value when it outputs it. That's not how it works. Oh, and it abstracts away values from their binary core.The puzzles themselves are rather basic for more or less experienced students of programming courses. Most are basic things you will do on high-level language. Only few ask you of stuff like create an multiplier algorithm with only addition and substraction. You actually will not be able to create an efficient algorithm for that in this game for values are abstracted away from binary core and thus you can't work with digits of binary, 0 and 1. Which I've learned from Nand2Tetris course, wmehe.Furthermore, there is no in-game hints to solving any puzzles so newbies will be stuck simply not knowing how to solve it in high-level, let alone low-level.So this game is best recommended for people who are beginners of high-level languages and want to take a look at how they would solve such algorithms on lower level. It's too basic for experts.Well, almost, there are also optimization puzzles so you can feel like a compiler. Code size and speed. Strangely, no RAM used which I think is more relevant to real world than code size. Really, the only ones caring about code size nowadays, instead of asset data size, are Denuvo critics, happy to point out at how flat +100MB size to .exe ruins EVERYTHING.  Well, unless you are trying to code for calculators and embedded systems and toasters, the sure. None the less, code size challenges are usually fun and result in fancy beautiful to look at code. Speed optimized code in this game on another hand are usually disasters to look and understand, with all the loops unrolled and cheesing by knowing the input limits, such as prematurely creating few prime numbers because input value never goes over certain size. Or the way that input in some levels has enough of 0 values to make special handling it worth it, while I am not so sure of it in more RL cases. Also, it's not exactly clear when the algorithm code finishes running on a level if it's all in a loop, which may waste few steps right at the very end. Though I've heard it has something to do with taking new empty input. I mostly hated these steps challenges and got demotivated after a while. Good thing Assembly is no more. And to think that I used to think of myself as little smartass before I got into actually programming and tried some low-level things. Who knew that low-level optimization is usually so much more tedius than doing it at high-level.So now compilers do all the assembly optimization. You should trust compilers and forget fake lies that human can easily outdo compilers, not anymore from what I know. Because I think it's a common sense to realize that compiler devs are just as ingenius as you, and if you came up with a nice rule for optimization then so did they.There is a plot, it sucks. What is a plot, there is no plot. Nice music and visuals tho, with OST included in game folder.Oh, and HUD and controls suck a little due to being designed for touch-screen.

I also have a lot of programming experience, since my work also requires day-to-day programming skills, but not yet at an expert level. With these contexts, my review will be based on a player with good programming skill, not a player who start learning how to code.Human Resource Machine is a programming game, where you are a stupid human in the room, following programs on the right. You have a handful of instructions, and your goal is to write a program to accomplish given tasks, pretty much like any other programming games. As an experienced programmer, those instructions are pretty much limited compared to modern programming languages like Python or C++. This restriction alone makes the game challenging in later levels. On the other hand, instructions themselves are easy to understand and are just drag-and-drop blocks, perfect if you want to learn how to program from scratch.If you never write a program before in your life, this game would be a perfect starting place. Here, you will learn the most essential concept of programming: the order of instructions. Computer programs work by reading instructions line by line from top to bottom. The game also visualises how your program works, so that you can understand this concept very clearly. This game, however, is not everything, since it is very limited in terms of capability, comparing to modern programming languages you would find tutorials from the Internet. If this game really inspires you to learn more about coding, congratulations, and I would recommend you to learn the Python programming language as your next step.If you are an experienced programmer, you will find this game to be quite challenging, but not as challenging as TIS-100 or SHENZHEN I\/O. You still have a very primitive set of instructions, pretty much like the Assembly language or in those two games. However, you are allowed to name your variables, you are not bounded by instruction limits, and writing programs in this game is just drag-and-drop. I completed every problem in this game in just over three hours, but I haven't been able to optimise each program to meet its optimal goal. If you are like me, you will find this game as a sweet treat for your brain, but it can also offer you a challenge if you want to.All in all, this game is suitable for all players out there, whether you have any coding experience or not. If you can use a mouse, you can play this game!","Cool game, played it 3 times (last time was on Steam on a Linux PC).

This is where most of the challenge comes from, but as a result, you're solving less interesting puzzles with less interesting methods. The brainteasers here lie mostly in replicating the basic commands that the game won't give you, before your code becomes so clunky as to be unreadable. Because all loops and decisions have to be implemented via a group of conditional JUMP instructions, this is the inevitable outcome, especially past the first thirteen levels or so.It doesn't help that this game is mouse-only - you click and drag another massive instruction button into your program, then click the floor tile it refers to or drag the end point of the JUMP instruction around, and so on.Accessible programming can be done well. Learning to write code by snapping blocks together works great for the ever-popular Scratch, for example. HRM is not what you want. It could be a great setup with interesting puzzles, if it didn't withhold the simplest instructions.Basic conditionals! You can only check whether a tile you're currently holding is zero or negative. You cannot do the same with floor tiles, and you cannot check for equality directly - only by combining the conditional JUMPs with arithmetic (plus and minus, that's all you get out-of-box). This is also the only means you have of implementing loops - but again, since you can only check the number you're holding, and you can only hold one thing at a time, that means a lot of tedious tile-wrangling.If you're interested in programming games, or order-of-operation games in general, you'll probably want to lock at Zachtronics' portfolio instead.

While described as a \"coding\" game you are still going into self contained 'levels' with a clear objective and some tools to figure out how to accomplish the task. Yes, you are running codes complete with lines and \"if this then that\" statements. And I have to admit at times it feels like work. But you still get that pleasant satisfaction when you at last figure out how to solve a puzzle that at first seems impossible. And little by little you build up your little machine until at last it handles the task at hand. Each level does get progressively harder, and I will freely admit the final level stumped me. Coding experience will help dramatically here, but neophytes will still be able to finish most of the levels. While there isn't a difficult setting per se, each level has 2 kinds of optimizations you can get for: least amount of lines of code, and least amount of 'cycles' required to complete the task. Both of which are going to challenge even experienced coders I expect. There are some additional bonus levels as well that are harder than the main 'story' levels as well. There is a story, or at least an attempt at one. It's quite dark and satirical. The game does not pull its punches on its commentary on large faceless corporations, which eventually just become robots.

You basically write pseudo-code that all of the pawns in each carry out, with the typical goal being to take the randomized input, perform level specific operations, and output only what the level requires, with the complexity being that every pawn shares the same instruction set. I am quite stupid and impatient, so the later levels are beyond me, but the game is still fun overall.","Well this \"game\" is really just a series of assembly language programs to complete with new instructions dribbled in along the way.  The only problem is it is assembly language without any support for things like typing commands or comments on a keyboard, breakpoints, selecting inputs etc making it a chore for any of the more complicated exercises.  Like you have a bug with inputs of 2, 0 as it is a special case.  Want to debug that?  Good luck if you didn't do it when it came up as all inputs are random(ish) so repeatedly stop and start your program until it comes up (or let it go through all the way and let it tell you it fails for other inputs and it will be added to the next set)... then of course it comes up last so you have to sit through a lot of useless stuff.  So it can be annoying because of that but anyone familiar with assembly language won't have much of a hard time with the exercises but they might find it a bit pointless, like I did.  I was hoping for a bit more game and less of just programming exercises.I can't see this being very enjoyable to a non-programmer at all.  The exercises are things like sorting, writing strings to output and other basic algorithms.  Assembly language isn't exactly the easiest thing to work with to begin with, and doing it by dragging and dropping and having no control beyond that can be tedious.  This is not the way to learn assembly language for the first time.So not recommending the game as I don't really see it as a game.  Doesn't mean it won't appeal to some people but I was hoping for something where I actually program little people to do office tasks or something a bit more fun, not this.","Surprisingly good."],["Absolutely epic game for low-level programming and logic puzzles.","1000101","I'm not a coder, but I did it, and it was fun!","Challenging puzzles"],["You can copy and paste the code from the game. put this in your program.

Also, the game doesn't really tell you anything, so if you were to use this to teach asm to a 5th grader, unless they were already a good problem solver they'd likely not make it past the orange path.

You also need to use a bit of high-school (?) math. This is actually considered one of the easier programming-based games, so it's a good place to start if you're looking to play one, but it's still challenging like most games in the genre, especially if you're totally new to programming. I learned some programming (Matlab) while doing my mechanical engineering degree (though I sucked at it!), and I struggled through more than a handful of the levels past the halfway point, until I finally got stuck with 5 levels to go.

This is basically teaching you digital I\/O, with a little bit of memory. The \"main\" problem is some of the deeper optimization to fit the \"extra achievement\" may be beyond some players if they are not familiar with the practice of optimization. The game places you as a \"corporate drone\" with some of the simplest tasks: move stuff from the input to the output. In between, you may have slight bit of memory to temporarily store and compare things in order to do the some processing. Like: pick out only PAIRS of numbers, dump the rest. You can think of each \"year\" as a programming puzzle, where you need to optimize for not just the number of instructions used, but also the number of steps taken to complete the task.  Optimziing the former is simple enough, but it will take MANY attempts and understanding, and perhaps, seeing a couple other attempts, in order to understand the further optimization. The art style is whimsical, but good fit in the developer's overall style, and the theme. You basically move square tiles from the in queue to the out queue with some processing in between. As with all programming puzzles, the object is to learn logical thinking, loops, and how to manipulate input into output. There are obviously, some extra thinking involved, due to the requirements.

I loved Little Inferno for its story, tone, and message, and was unrealistically hoping for more of the same: a simple brain-spa day with a dismally uplifting mood. That was on me, I take responsibility for my expectation. The game strives toward a mood and message (quite similar to Little Inferno, if I read it correctly, though not as explicit or blunt) and the few intermission movies string along a few lines of dialogue from each level, blending them into a story of shallow futility in the end.These moments were rare enough that the gameplay was brought front and center. And here is where my expectation burned me. Why would the developers make another game just like the first? It would certainly fly in the face of their own message. At first, I was able to shift expectation gears and enjoy the challenge of optimizing my code, but in the last few levels, I found the levels to be tedious. No longer restricting my use of guides to only when I was stuck or needed inspirations, I began copying whole code from them and didn't even care to optimize them more. I just wanted to get to the next cutscene, see more of the non-gameplay elements. But those also let me down. Just a little. In a way, it's very fitting. In a game about the depressing futility of effort and the naive joy of a shallow understanding, I gave up on the effort for effort's sake, I surrendered to the ignorance of accomplishments absent understanding, and took shortcuts to reach a disappointing end. The victory was not made sweeter by the hours I spent optimizing the first 35 levels. I suspect it is no coincidence that you never reach 42.Perhaps I've made or projected too much of it, but this game does follow Little Inferno in one respect: the message it conveys hits the hardest after the game has been \"completed\" and I reflect back on what I just did. I can ponder and answer whether copying from the guide leaves me feeling unaccomplished. I think it does not, and I can walk away from this battle against the killer robot of meaningless effort with a smile, a thumbs up, and a spare eight hours (which is what I anticipated the last six levels might take me) to ... dive into Tomorrow Corporation's next game.","One of the few games I know to be both mentally challenging and a near-direct mirror of real-life skills.

This game might be a good starter to see if you're suited to that type of logical thinking. While the game is closer to an assembly language than one you would actually be using for most purposes, it still requires similar modes of thinking and requires you to complete similar tasks. Do not feel bad if you have trouble with the later half of the game however, as it gets very hard! And don't worry, most higher-level languages make tasks from the late game trivial, so do not be afraid to learn an actual programming language :P.As a programmer, I personally enjoyed this game a lot, completing all of the tasks and at least one challenge on each task bar one (a lot of the complexity challenges were tough!). I personally recommend it, but only if you enjoy programming or are looking to learn. If you just enjoy logical puzzles, this may also be fun for you.Here's a list of the programming concepts present in this game (there's probably more I've forgotten too):-Conditional statements-Variables-Mathematical operators (including how multiplication, division and remainder function at machine level)-Post-incrementation and post-decrementation operators-Loops-Complexity analysis (the challenges for each level. Challenge one is closer to Big-O complexity which is what most actual programmers use)-Arrays and\/or pointers (the game kinda combines the two into one, which makes sense as that's how arrays are stored at machine level).-Sentinel values-Strings-Linked lists-Matrices.-Sorting algorithms (what did you use for the last level? I used an insertion sort.)","A great puzzle game that uses code derived logic to program puzzles. A fantastic introduction to logic and code for the older player.

Teaches you Assembly while also being super fun."],["Solve programming puzzles using a simple language which resembles low-level assembly.  If you're experienced with low-level programming you'll find the puzzles easy for the most part, but there are also optimization challenges where you have to optimize your solution for size or speed (size being the total number of instructions in your program and speed being the number of instructions executed).  These optimization challenges can be difficult even if you're experienced.The game's fictional assembly-language is extremely minimal and contains only the instructions necessary to solve the problems the game presents you with; this is occasionally frustrating because it limits your creativity compared to what you'd be able to do on a real CPU.  Even low-end microcontrollers like the MSP430 or the AVR are way more versatile than Human Resource Machine's fictional language.The editor is the only weak part of this game; you edit code using a simple graphical flow-chart.  You write comments by drawing on blank pieces of paper with the mouse, which is tedious and discourages you from writing comments at all.  There's an undo button but no redo button.  The undo button doesn't even show you what was just undone.  The only redeeming factor is that you can actually copy\/paste your code into a real text editor, although that has its own problems since the syntax is undocumented and you can't see the comments you wrote in the game (they're stored in some sort of bitmap format which is encoded with plaintext).Overall I'd say this is fun if you are familiar with computer programming and enjoy solving puzzles.

And for those who have trouble getting through programming principles and processes, this is a good step and will show you where you can get stuck without any other complications.","TL;DR While lacking long-term game replay, Human Resource Machine is an engaging puzzle game worth the money and time spent, but only if you can handle the various IDE issues it has that sometimes trips it up, and make you actually want to ragequit and uninstall at times.Disclaimer: I was a programmer and systems administrator over a 20 year IT career, with limited experience with Z-80A Assembly Language programming during my TRS-80 days in the 1980s.Human Resource Machine from Tomorrow Corporation is a puzzle game that asks you to write a program to make an employee of a nameless company complete tasks. These tasks are varied but share a common theme: you're in an office with an inbox, an outbox, a boss sitting at a desk, and many data cubes assigned numerical values. From there you take these data cubes that come in from the inbox, do something with them, and take the end result to the outbox. This might seem terribly boring but it's not and will even hold your attention for the following reasons: Your progression in the game (shown as an ascension to the next floor on an elevator) from completing tasks moves the story, complete with cutscenes. The game overall is light-hearted and comical in presentation, and will remind you of a Dilbert comic strip. Your character and even the bosses you interact with (explained later) are cute little things that squeak while speaking.The bosses that sit at a desk in the room with you are there to tell you what you need to do, offer examples to help clear up any confusion you might have about what needs to be done, and give comical relief when asked to \"tell me more\". They will also tell you, in a rather abrasive and jarring bad boss manner, if you screwed up or at least present a programming solution that will work only some of the time. On that latter point, they will explain WHY your solution fails, or will fail in some cases, which I found very helpful.The programming language you use is akin to assembly language, complete with jump statements reminiscent of Ye Olde Dayes of spaghetti code programming and very basic arithmetic commands (ADD and SUB). If you have even a bit of assembly language programming experience, you shouldn't have too much trouble. If you're more of a high-level programming language affectionato comfortable with BASIC, Python, or the various C languages, it's going to be harder for you: a conditional jump statement is not the same as a conditional decision statement and there's no modern programming conventions like division and multiplication, modular programming design like subroutines, or variable specialisations. You'll need to unlearn what you've applied in those languages, and a newcomer to programming will actually have a better time understanding the command set than a seasoned high-level language person like myself. The only reason why I was able to adapt and complete the game was that I used to program in Z-80A assembly language on a Radio Shack computer as a hobby back in my teens.While I highly recommend this game, It's not without its faults and it is worth noting before you make the decision to purchase. I'll start with the IDE and I won't hold back on what I'm about to say. It's a dog's breakfast previously eaten and later regurgitated. A complete and total mess. I can say this because I've worked with so many IDEs as far back as the 1980s with IBM's OS\/400 text editor for RPG\/III and CL\/400. I have tons of experience --- not a brag ---- with IDEs and I know what things make a good IDE. This IDE has no indentation whatsoever so when dealing with nested JUMP loops its easy to lose track of where things are supposed to happen with flow and scope. The use of curved lines to show the execution sequence is a start but they are not colourized or earmarked unless you click one jump statement. There's a reason why we use colored cables (or at least labelled ones) when setting up a computer or a stereo system. It's so we know where things are hooked up.The biggest issue I have is probably one of the most important parts in any programming language: the comment. In Human Resource Machine, you can comment your code but you can't use the keyboard for documentation. You write with either your mouse, a trackpad, or some sort of drawing instrument. WHY? I can only imagine how the folk at Tomorrow Corporation came up with this idea during a meeting:Person A: We need something that will make our game stand out from the rest of the pack.Person B: We have cute adorable characters set in a comical environment!Person A: That's not enough.Person C: We focus on gameplay mechanics that drive an engaging storyline rather than mindless high-end graphic eye-candy!Person A: Nah, we need more!Person D: ....Person D: I. GOT. IT. Instead of typing comments in your source code....we either write them or draw them out. Person C: That's EDGY!Person B: No one has done this before! We'll be the first to put cat pictures and dirty artwork in programs!Person A: Make it so!It's like putting a ton of sticky memos on my compile-time printouts and handing them to the project leader. Just no dirty artwork, you understand. I'm a class act despite what you see the portrait picture. How does this work for someone without a writing device, or have a physical impairment? I suffered from tunnel carpal and using a mouse to write my comments out was making my wrist hurt. There should have been a choice to use the keyboard in place of writing comments out rather than having writing the only way. To put a bow on my list of issues, the replayability factor is non-existent. Once the last puzzle is done and the final cinematic is played (a pretty good one I must admit), that's it, done. There is no workshop option like in Opus Magnum where you can create puzzle challenges to share with other players. I could go back and try to make my previous solutions more efficient or faster, or do the side-tasks which are optional, but I have had such a bad experience with the IDE (it actually upset me enough times to make me want to rage-quit and uninstall), I don't have a desire to return back to it. Don't let the nitpicks I made put you off though from buying the game though. I highly recommend it because It's really good and a nice intro to programming if you are flat out new.

It has some flaws that need to be adressed, basically editing your \"code\" becomes a hassle in the endgame, there is no easy way to delete large chunks of your code, or copy\/paste only a portion of your code. You can add labels to your code for ease of understanding, but you have to hand draw the text. Why??? Why can't we type the label text with our keyboard? Anyway, also looping is kinda hard at the endgame. Why can't we define a section label, and use the goto command wih that label? The arrows become disorienting at the endgame, and you can not route to the same label with ease. Anyway, it is still a good game but needs some improvements.","Most excellent.

For its price, it is quite too short, and the puzzles are not that interesting. The puzzles are what'd you expect from beginner Computer Science courses, not from a fun game, and the last puzzle solidifies it. I mean, implement sorting algorithm? This is as dull as a CS assignment could get. Maybe people outside of programming could find some puzzles here fun, but making them come up with a sorting algorithm, especially with a UI and a command set like that, that's just cruel. The trailer says, \"you'll be taught everything you need to know\", but the game sometimes quite literally tells you to go google it if you don't understand something, and yeah, that's how it works in the world of programming, but that's how it should not work in the world of video games.Yeah, UI, it is not up to the task. Given how much junk commands you'd have to write to get things done, the screen space is not enough to fit a comprehensible amount of commands, it is too easy to get lost and lose the full picture of what you're writing. The thing where you draw comments instead of writing them is a funny quirk, but comment blocks cannot be attached to an individual line and are too chunky and eat too much of valuable screen space. I also wish there was a way to group instructions or at least move them as a block. Again, it is a game medium, so the sky is the limit in how to implement the programming and its UI, but what we have here is assembly, but clunkier.The game is probably a satire, but I feel like it has too little to say, compared to their previous games.
