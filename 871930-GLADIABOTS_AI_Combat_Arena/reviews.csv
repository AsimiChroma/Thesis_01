I have taken part in other coding AI games (Halite AI) and had a lot of fun improving my bot over the course of those tournaments. After they ended I always wanted more. This game nails the feel of those coding tournaments as well as simplifying the learning process with a very intuitive interface and a simple left to right, top to bottom execution process. It's simple to get into, but oh so very deep. I received this game for free as a part of the Tilt5 Kickstarter and I am so excited to see this game brought to life on my table with AR. I am just starting to scratch the surface of this game, but am already getting sucked into the rabbit hole. Nothing beats the cycle of fine tuning your AI, only to watch them do something stupid and have to go back and figure out why that happened and then starting again."

Personally, I was expecting more of a robot-wars type game where you don't just give your bots AI to direct them in matches, but also equip them with weapons or tools to fit various roles. This is instead a true programmer's game. there are 4 pre-made classes and to win matches in the various playstyles of capture, domination and elimination you have to maken AI's that make sure your bots work together to make use of their strengths and complete the objective. Haven't played online yet, which the game itself insists is the true experience, so i can't speak for that part yet. I can say that the campaign is difficult. The change in layout of how many bases or other objectives there are and how far away they are can make the levels seem almost like a puzzle at times. To summarize, you only get to customize the appearance of every bot, but their AI can be edited to an insane degree, which you will need to do to win matches in the various playstyles."

There is asynchronous multiplayer which allows you to fight other players AI while they're not even online, so the matchmaking is never stagnant, despite if there's a low concurrent player count."

It may look nice and tidy at first but it's a complete mess that the dev should have had fixed by someone competent, at least in some update.There are windows all over the place, menus that you can reach by clicking here and maybe there, different versions of the same menus, confusing icons in the AI menu, arrows that sometimes go back and others close an overlay, some more that send you to the main menu. Changing the team bots takes way longer than it should and there is no way to go straight to it after a battle?!? (you'll be doing that a lot). Even the playback controls are confusing.You have to create a login and confirm it by email, and you will not be able to change it or reset it. I came back to it after years and wanted to start from scratch but NOPE, no can do. I guess this was to push people to keep a single ID and compete online, but what if I don't care about any of that?There are links to all socials, shops etc. all over the place, I can see the dev tried to make this into a big tournament deal, but that came at the cost of the single-player mode.TL;DR:  In this game you have no controls of the bots, you do that through the menus, and the menus are an absolute mess.

At that time I realized limitations of ""programming language"" of the game by means of which you script your bot's behaviour. There were suggestions on forum for several extensions, which never came to life. Instead, game was developed to enhance visuals and understandability. To me personally, since 2017 to 2020 game changed for worst, and I can say why exactly:* Visuals became swishy-swooshy, and unnecessary details, sounds, non-switchable direction lines between bots burdened my eyes for some reason (I don't say it is bad for everyone).* Size of AI scripts was cropped, while tools for comfortable and faster code organization weren't developed.* Considering previous point, new tablet-oriented and more casual interface made everything slower and I time spent on coding started to pay off less and less. I started to be annoyed by that and lazy to play.* You can't deploy x10 matches like back in 2017, you HAVE to wait until you have played single match. That, again, appeals to my patience and makes everything slower. * Game started to require more hardware power to run, by the way.Overall it seems like more and more obstacles to playing game have been emerging since 2017 in favour of visuals and casuality (probably to gain popularity among not interested in programming and equalize conditions for everyone). I'd love to play again, but I'll wait a year or so to try it out again."

871930,18,0,MaccGaz,113,7,1,60.7,"June 19, 2019","I'm a fan of strategy games that take a bit of thought and decided I'd give this one a go. It starts of very simple with some very basic logic for the bots, but it's rewarding to win each battle. When you lose, you often identify a flaw in your plans and devise a way around it. Then, you get another little win for yourself when you succeed!Before long your bots are targeting vulnerable enemies, group targeting enemies, distracting enemies, sneak attacking orbs, covering orb carriers. They're given separate roles, to collect, harry, cover, guard bases, etc. Then, more scenario things like what to do for the initial map rush or when it's a tie game with 1 resource left a new tactic is applied. There's lots of scope on how to win your matches in this game.It becomes quite complex, but the UI on the game is good and you can break down your logic into small chunks. I'd have liked a ""chunk"" which returned a true or false to re-use some logic, but apart from that, the UI is good and pretty easy to use.The other aspect I wasn't too keen on was tagging (Which can be used to team target something) - I just couldn't get it to work consistently and I stopped using that after a while. I found that I didn't need it and actually having the individual bots work cleverly, but targeting vulnerable enemies worked best.Sometimes it was difficult to keep track of what I'd changed as you tweak the plan, so it'd be nice to have a kind of ""source control"", where you save your logic and have a compare function to see what you changed and then ""check in"" when you're happy.In the end I got a nice team together and got up into the top 5 in the active bronze ladder, where I was winning 60-70% of the games. I found that very small changes made big differences - e.g. retreating too early left enemy bots free too much, or targeting the right enemy in one situation was the wrong one in another. A bad logic bug would cost you the game!As a result of all of this, you'll never get a perfect set of logic that is unbeatable. There's always that bit of luck with the scenarios, orb and base placement, who managed to just nick that central orb, etc. So you will lose games, but a strong tactics that do well in a wide variety of scenarios can make you very tough to beat. Some games are won in the first few moments and you can fast forward it, others are real tense affairs where you shout at your bots to finish off the enemy when you know it'll win you the game or when you/the enemy just gets the last orb over the line.I only really played the collection mode, with a few games of domination. It wasn't quite as good and I stopped playing elimination very quickly as bots can become very difficult to kill and these matches can go on for a long time with barely a death.I feel like I've just about got my fill of the game (60 hours), but I thought it was very good and satisfied my urge for a challeng. You should definitely buy it if sounds interesting to you. Well done devs!"

Hopefully we all know that.The game itself needs a bit of polish but it has a hell of a lot of potential. The tutorial has great detail to get you started, and the drag and drop system is well put together and intuitive. I only have two complaints with the drag and drop programming system. The first is that the terminology they use is a bit clunky. By that, I mean that certain aspects of the game feel like they have been poorly translated to English from another language. The second is that there are limited ways to pass variables which makes programming a little difficult/limited. The limitation from variable passing makes it especially difficult to coordinate multiple robots and multiple objectives.Ok, drum roll...lets do the math...

Perfect for players who are interested in coding. Some of the characteristics (I think) to become a better player are self-motivated, consistent reflect and improve, detail-oriented, patient, willing to learn, accept their own weaknesses and critical thinking. You do not have to know any coding languages to become a good player, but some coding logics are indeed needed if you are aiming to become the best.

This bug, that hadn't existed back in development, made me realize this game has gone backwords in progress, and why I quit playing the game back when it was free, all it has added is a fancy game mode, respawning, some levels, way more A.I. commands then needed that were difficult to manuver, and more bugs. This little progress and a still increasing price just makes it not worth the money or time to play. The game quality has gone down with the price increasing. I am a sad the game turned out the way it did, and wish maybe it had gone a slightly differnt path. The game's orginal idea was what made me want to buy this game, I felt it didn't stick to that idea very well and failed to improve on what needed to be changed."

871930,0,0,Anima_Animus,272,2,1,39.0,"May 27, 2019","I have really enjoyed the programming puzzle of this game so far, particularly because of the multiplayer aspect where you pit your AI against other real players' AI asynchronously. This allows the game to be played even when players are not all online at the same time.The game is fundamentally about designing the best AI. Create an AI, test it against other players or in the singleplayer scenarios, see what worked and what didn't, iterate, test again, etc. Did you program your AI well enough to handle the semi-random arenas and complete the objective of the selected game mode? That is the fundamental question of this game.Some negative reviews are complaining that the programming is tedious, obtuse, and difficult to do ""basic"" things with. I don't really have any complaints so far with the programming, but maybe that's because I'm coming from the perspective of trying to figure out what I can do with the drag-and-drop interface rather than starting with what I want to do and then getting frustrated by the limitations of the system. A lot of complaints seem to be coming from people with a programming background. Maybe they are more used to the total freedom that real programming has.Another criticism I've seen is that debugging your AI is difficult. I haven't had any particular problems with debugging. Yes, it is ""tedious"" in the sense that you have to replay parts of your matches and take notes (mental or otherwise) to figure out what you think went wrong, then build a solution, but again, that's the fundamental point of the game. I find it engaging to improve my AI over time. I can't think of any additional tools that the developer could have provided that would drastically improve my debugging experience.Again, I've really enjoyed my time with this game so far. It is a somewhat niche game, but if you find this kind of thing interesting, it can be very addicting."

871930,48,3,zeroinsom,210,33,-1,24.5,"May 26, 2019","Great concept and very well executed, especially considering it's a solo dev job.  Full disclosure: I've been a coder forever and it's what I do for a living, so I'm a tad biased.  But I will phrase this review for anyone who's like ""ew, programming"".I'll skip the countless things this game does right, which includes making your own AI a very fun exercise.  And I'll get right to the fatal flaw, in my opinion.The biggest drawback is the closed nature of both the developer and community.This is one of those ""easy to pick up hard to master games"".  Which I normally love.  So what's the problem?  Instead of getting highly technical I will compare it to two other similar games and how this differs substantially so you know what to expect going in.Compared to something like chess (also easy to learn hard to master), the closed nature is immediately obvious.  If you lose in chess, even to a top ranked player, you know _exactly_ how they did it.  There are countless books and videos and discussions on moves and strategy.  Or you can simply watch what they did and learn alone.Example two, let's say you play a card game where you build your own deck.  You also know, at the very least, what cards were played against you.  And in virtually all cases I can think of the community, including top ranked players, are happy to share their creations with everyone else.This is in stark contrast to this game and my prime complaint.  Heck, even if you lose to the AI, you don't know what it's doing.But even when I squash a mission, why not show me what strategy I beat?  Lift the curtain so to speak.  So I can get a feel for my strengths and weaknesses and ideas on new strategies.  Well, you can't.  Same goes with online play.Why this is the case I'm not sure, but historically this is usually due to a problem being solvable.  If there exists a heavily optimized solution that should always beat less optimized solutions (think game theory, expected value, standard deviation, etc...), would you give up your perfect design?  Probably not.However, if it was something akin to rock, paper, scissors I don't think it would be closed.  It should be the case that every design or build has its weakness which would lead to the community wanting to share and innovate new ideas as the meta shifts.I expect most of the playerbase will become frustrated after hitting the ""glass ceiling"" not because they are losing, but because they don't know _why_ they are losing.  They can guess, but the game will not show you.  And that's when it becomes less fun.Edit:I eventually revisited this on request of a comment, and my review still stands as a hard no.  That said, I think it's a step in the right direction in a genre that will inevitably become popular.But ultimately there's an identity crisis here.  Namely, what's the target demographic?  Who is this game for?Is this about AI (which is in the name):  no.  Any real AI need to be capable of learning, which could be as simple as a neural network - which are actually extremely simple to create.  This is a state machine, and a precursor before learning any types of real AI.Is this about coding:  no.  Expose an API to code against and the developers would destroy non-developers.  And it's also the exact opposite way you want to learn to code (aside from very simple if/else conditionals).  If I was teaching C++, C. ASM, etc... I would greatly discourage this as a tool.  About the only thing you'll learn are simple conditionals.Is this about strategy:  no.  The game is easily solvable, if it wasn't a huge pain to do so with the limited tool set.  There is far too little variance for any real strategy to evolve.I'd compare this to a turn-based strategy game where you set up all your moves ahead of time, everyone plays the same overly simple race on a very limited map pool, and then you press go.  On top of that, imagine vague or completely unknown mechanics, which this definitely has."

I've played similar games (like CodinGame Podracers) before, but they seemed to fall short. the depth of strategy seemed to be quite shallow, and they couldn't hold my interest for long. But this game? The amount of control given to you is immense. there are limitless possibilities of strategies (many of which will fail of course) and you can really feel how every detail in your design and strategy makes a big impact on whether you win or lose.This game also sports a very intuitive and simple visual programming system which is second nature to me as a hobbyist programmer, and should come easily to most anyone who plays the game with a little research and practice.Perhaps the best part about this game is that instead of only competing against a computer or trying to solve a specific set problem, this game puts you in a position where you want to work towards the most all-around powerful design so that you can beat other players who you will be put up against in asynchronous multiplayer battles online.If you invest time and effort into this game, you can climb the ranks and find your place in the leaderboard!I highly recommend this game, but if you've played other programming games in the past and specifically disliked that mechanic, this game might not be for you.

I like the fact that color schemes have been implemented for bots, as the gray bots are very dull and this should add some life to that.  I didn't relook at the combat, but I did go into the AI and check if any of my issues were addressed.  They weren't, particularly the one that was most important to me in being able to move toward a specific map position.  Rather than having to move toward a bot, resource, capture point, or powerup, there is simply no reason that people can't move toward/away from the center, walls, corners, allied/enemy sections because the reality is these zones are already implemented into the game.  Its just that you can only move toward objects that are closest to or on these zones.    This is a game about designing AI for a team of bots designed to compete against other teams.  There are three different game modes to choose from and four different bot classes to choose from.  The single player campaign is quite extensive with I believe 20 chapters to choose from.   The multiplayer deals with an ELO type system and the great thing about the system is that players don't necessarily have to be online for you to challenge their bots meaning even with a low population it can sustain.Given all of this, why am I not recommending the game?  The answer is simple.  While everything works, is well presented, not play to win, and the developer has done a lot to work around the problems, the ultimate question is:  Is it fun and is it interesting?  It is neither.Designing the AI itself isn't so bad.  They even give you starter AIs to build from.  You basically drag everything from a tree.  The game also explains how to create AND and OR conditions with multiple object types.  This is where I spent a lot of time, and it's legitimately interesting to think about different strategies for the different types.  As a programmer I enjoyed trying to think of ways to have bots to do interesting kinds of movements and strategies. The highlight for me was designing a harassing strategy that presented targeting difficulties for the enemy.  But after this point it starts to break down.  When you actually get into the arena, there's no interesting aspect to wins a fight.  It basically comes down to which AI derps the least, as there's no stat differences (that I could tell) between members of the same class. Every sniper is the same.  Every shotgunner is the same. Every machine gunner is the same.  Because of the way these classes work, they can only be played certain ways without a lot of wriggle room.  This is compounded by the fact that there are three actions a bot can do:  Shoot, move, and score (in collection mode).  There are powerups on the map which can present a small amount of strategic diversity, but every encounter between bots plays out the same way:  Fire, retreat when shield is low or empty, return to battle.  If you're really just interested in nuts and bolts AI vs AI and don't care about interesting battles and want to prepare your AI for all situations and program it to respond properly to everything it encounters you can get more strategic depth, but that's where the other critical problem comes in, and that is the debugging.  The debugging process is monotonous and extremely slow.  In most programming languages or even games, you can very quickly spot problems and correct them, but the problem with this game is that unless you've done extensive testing of your AI, you're going to see derpy things happen during your matches that you don't understand, and you have to rewind the game and go to a debug window to find out exactly why it's behaving in a way you didn't want.  Not only does this completely break up the gameplay experience to have to stop watching a match to do this, but finding out exactly where the problem is can be troublesome as you often have to completely pause the game and go step by step just to figure out which decision branch is failing.I have experience debugging programs and have been doing it for a long time so I can instantly understand when I have a sign flipped or am checking the wrong variable, but for anyone who isn't a computer scientist it's going to be even more tedious.  And that's where I'm at right now.  I will say that I got the $10 it cost me worth of playing time, and the developer did a diligent job and this is no knock on the devs.  I see where they have tried to solve the problems and didn't ignore them.  On those merits some might want to give it a chance just on those merits, but ultimately I need to rate a game on whether it's worth it for YOU to spend your hard earned money and at this point I can't say the game has a good enough system in place yet.What would change my mind?-More bot classes, customizable bot classes.-Bot abilities with cooldowns, items on the map that do more than increase health or shield (i.e. damage buffs, items that deal damage, etc...).-More AI options so you don't have to program workarounds for things that aren't there (where lots of bugs happen).    An example would be the ability to move toward or flee areas on the map like toward boundaries, toward the center, etc...-Maybe another mode or two.  A MOBA mode would actually be nice for this kind of game and might even work with the current setup."

Even for someone like me who has never understood more about programming than game maker games (due to the drag and drop, similar to this), I can use it. What bothers me is the usage of the word AI when it has nothing to do with AI. You don't make your bots intelligent. They don't think for themselves. Just a bunch of if/thens. Which surely isn't as catchy, but I'd have liked if the game wasn't using false pretenses to get you into it.

Having some action, strategy and a bunch of dakka is a huge bonus... and Gladiabots certainly delivers in spades! One major issue I have with other ""online"" games is that, well, I suck at them. Enter Gladibots. The “gameplay” aspect is purely cosmetic and/or diagnostic. By the time you're watching robots trade injuries, the battle has already been decided. The REAL game is before this, in the AI developer and Team builder. How are you going to build your team? Will you be aggressive and try to kill off the enemy team, then win resources? Or will you try to quickly capture everything? Or are you well versed in military tactics and set up a fire team with a base of fire, sniper support and a maneuver element to flank? The choices are as endless as your imagination!All that said, there ARE a couple of things to be aware of: There IS a learning curve. Even with the tutorial breaking things down to ""using crayons"", things can get complex with amazing speed. It will take a little bit of patience to make it over the initial bump to intuitive understanding before the world becomes your oyster. Think of it like Chess - It take a little bit of effort to remember how all the pieces move, but once you do you can really start to LEARN. It's the same thing here, once you learn the first few bits of the Gladiabots programming UI the pieces (literally) fall into place. Well, maybe not ""fall"" since you need to drag them, but the point still stands. Since people seem to love Pro/Con lists, I'll make one. Pros:- Fun- In active development- Well polished (despite being in development)- Thought /Skill based, not ""twitch"" based gameplay- Helps develop logical thinking patterns- FUN- Active, open and welcoming community on Discord- The Game Developer is very friendly and responsive- No violence against living things - robots in an arena only- There is no ""Right"" answer, there are infinite ones!Cons:- Can be intimidating to people completely unfamiliar with the genera- Expectations might be misplaced for people hoping to actually drive the robots in battle- The learning curve may be too steep for people unaware of learning/help resources (tutorial, youtube, forums, etc)In short, I can't recommend this game highly enough!"

I normally love logic & strategy games, but it's not as appealing for me as I thought it would be, nor is there anywhere near the amount of creative freedom available in team configuration. I think the AI editor, game-menus, and general menu-navigation needs improvement, as well as to look less bland. There is not much really making me want to go back into the AI editor right now to fix my team after losing. The game also lacks the depth that usually makes me want to commit more time to it.

I've played countless hours on the mobile version.In summary+ If you like to puzzle, develop strategies, code or perfecting your work, you will probably like this game. It doesn't have the live action a FPS offers, but it is great fun watching your creations fight other players, perfecting them along the way. Everything is made by a single dev, that works hard on updating the game and only charges money for costmetics that can be unlocked through playing the game as well. - The biggest con i can think of is that you need to learn it's not always bad to lose, it sucks if your elo rank drops down or if you can't beat a singleplayer chapter. Which will probably happen to everyone at least once.If you're still skeptical: Try it on mobile!(""Do you guys not have phones!?"")No, seriously. This game can be amazing and has good support(it even has a wiki) so try it out for free if any of this sounds interesting, and if you don't like it just leave it at that. You can even play the game on mobile only, as I have done for a long period of time. And if you like it and want to play the game on PC to look at your AI you created in 4k60(or are just more comfortable with your mouse),buy the game on steam to support the developer so he can improve the game even more.The Review Accesability It might look daunting to see the complex AI's built by the community. But i believe everyone who likes strategy or puzzle games can like this game. After 30 minutes you probably understand the entire game system, but you can choose to make an AI as big as you want:You can choose to go through the singleplayer chapters and try to make an new algorithm for each specific level to beat it, as if it were a puzzle. Or you can go hardcore and try to make an algorithm that can beat all chapters. Dont like singleplayer? Go for the ranked matches that give some more of a challenge.  And don't be afraid you aren't nerdy or try-harding enough to beat people, you get matched to players at your level. Or just play casual unranked. gameplay There isn't any coding experience required, you can use the simple blocks system that's made for this game wich is pretty intuitive.  I personally love perfecting my giant AI's and adding all kinds of special strategies depending on the situation, but it's also fun to keep it small and efficient as possible. For me the most fun in the game is definetely to play ranked and analyzing why i lost to make sure that doesn't happen again. And it feels really great if that strategy you just added makes your bots outsmart the other team and turn the tides the next match. I have been following this game for a long time and watched it grow, and grown it has, in my opinion only for the better. So don't get put off by the ""Indie"" and ""Early acces"" tags as it is being heavily updated by the creator. AFAIK there is currently even being worked on multiple new game modes. The game has a great community and that's what it's built for. It's not a cash grab or anything, and definetely not pay to win, which brings me to my last point: The only currency in this game can be unlocked by playing the singleplayer chapters and leveling up, as well a getting a league promotion in ranked, there are no ""Diamonds"" or anything that's microtransaction only. That currency can then be used to buy the cosmetics as seen in the the screenshots in the store, no premium weapons that make your bots better. The only thing that determines your perfomance are the strategies you came up with. Of course these credits can be bought, which is just a way for the creator(yes, just one dev) to earn his bread."

I'll be hitting that mark this morning and am pretty stoked to be diving in again. I played a game called Carnage Heart as a kid, it sold me on behavior tree games like this. There is a good amount of controll for your bots but not an overwhelming amount. The game happily teaches you how to build a basic AI and provides a training ground called the Campaign.Each time I do minor tweaks to my bots I take them back through the highest chapter I've completed in the Campaign to make work out bugs before getting back on the ladder. After I level off on the ladder, I go back to the Campaign and try to push higher using new things I learned from multiplayer.I can easily see this game getting over a hundred hours from me in the first month. I'm a huge fan of this genre, but I think this game will take the number one place for recommending friends try the genre out. The behavior tree lets programmers and non-programmers alike compete which is a grand achievement and GFX47 should be very proud."

871930,3,0,76561198149316566,145,12,1,54.5,"November 6, 2018","The goal is simple. Assemble a squad of bots, battle other squads while competing for resources. Well, there is another part to it. Your bots have to make decisions on the battlefield using the AI instructions you programmed them with. You cannot intervene during battles. You might be put off by a steep learning curve, but fear not. There are very useful tutorials that will hold your hand until you have all you need to start programming. The programming is very user friendly and makes use of neat visual flow charts instead of text code. Debugging is made easy with the ability to spectate any of your bots and see the path selection they take in real time. You can also test your AI in a sandbox mode. Once you have the basics down you have a wide variety of conditions and actions to choose from to program an efficient fighting force. How complex you want to go is really up to you.I would recommend you start with the campaign, but once you have a good basic understanding of the game, multiplayer is where all the fun is at. Multiplayer puts you in an asymmetric online battle against other player programmed AI. The ranking system will match you up against players of the same skill level during which you will face a wide variety of different team assemblies and strategies Tweak and improve on your own team to progress through the ranks. Overall the game is very well put together, very unique, and a ton of fun."

Completely ruins the entire idea of the game.  Such a shameIn Response to the Developer :  A far FAR better solution would have been to add a 'limited' mode which you can switch to which applies these restrictions and has its own ranked MP, allowing anyone to choose how they want to go, big (but slow) or small (but limited).   You certainly could have left the sandbox open to any type of AI, its not even against othersOLD REVIEWAbsolutely fantastic game if you like the idea of programming ai but don't want to have to actually program the ai :PThe AI editor with its clockwise mechanic makes for interesting solutions and problems to solve that will test your brain powerOverall if you think you'd like spending hours tweaking and improving an (at one stage simple) AI for battle robots and pitting them against bots made by people from all over the world in epic battles, buy this game."

I didn't plan for that and got owned, then later copied that idea into my own coding.  An example of my general strat and some AI nodes/modules I've created: conservative defense, shoot from long range possible, push up if ally bot nearby is firing (suppression), tag weak enemies (focus fire), charge if weaker enemy fleeing (hunter), if low health but enemy is lower: attack (bloodlust), if we outnumber: attack aggressively without care (kamikaze), if no friendlies nearby and round time <5seconds: move towards closest ally (formation). Really fun. 8 bots, can have two of each specialist class, and each one can have their own unique AI. Lovely game. The fun is in optimizing the code and making your bots godly."

During battle you can fastforward, slowdown, rewind and see your progam's inner workings every step, so it's easy to debug. Also battles have no randomness to them, if you didn't change AI, battle's going to be the same, so you can watch same battle several times to see what exactly went wrong. So tools for AI building are nice.The game is aimed at multiplayer. There's a solo campain, but it's basically multiplayer vs predefined bots of increasing difficulty. The way multiplayer works is you battle other player's AIs and get rating points for winning, lose them for losing. Since all you need to battle is two AIs, your opponent doesn't actually have to be online, so there's no problem of waiting for opponent ever. Unfortunately because it's multiplayer, the game is really hard: as your program becomes better, improving it becomes increasingly complicated, and there're always players smarted than you with even more complex AIs."

Mindrover when released in 2000 quickly gathered a cult following. Multiple websites were setup and people would send in their encrypted bot code and the site owners would run the code and post the leaderboards. I would stay up nights obsessed with perfecting my bots and perfecting their movements and tracking. Eventually like all other games, Mindrover was left behind for some other newer fancier game and the small community around it faded into nothing. Cognitoy the company that made Mindrover no longer exists.Over the past two decades, multiple bot programming games have come out and I have played them all. All of them have had some flaw to them. Most of them came down to not doing the programming aspect of the game right. The most popular ones would just have you learn Java. All of them have been poorly executed in my mind. Just not fun to play.I have tried to find a similar bot programming game that lived up to the gameplay, quality, and additctiveness of Mindrover.

You can play either against pregenerated AI opponents or in a ranked muliplayer league, both of which are challenging.The animations and sounds in the arena are excellent, so it looks great.

It's asynchronous multiplayer (praise be!), so you'll be matched up to other players' ghosts of a similar level. There is a league system, and it tracks your elo too. You can fast forward your matches, you can rewind, watch replays etc. The AI programming bit is about as painless as it can be.The tutorial is really good and there is a campaign you can play through too, though I've not done much of that.It also works on your phone (and you can sync it), though unless you've got a phablet it might be a bit tricky to really get into the nitty gritty of a big AI, I much prefer playing it on the laptop.So if this sounds like your kind of thing, then it probably is - the implementation of the ideas is really good and the Trello board promises more cool stuff too."

871930,5,0,76561198007392268,446,16,1,41.8,"August 11, 2018","This is a very unique and wonderfull game for tacticians! It's about robot battles between teams of 4 robots each. The important part: During the actual battle, you cannot give orders to your robots. Instead, you need to equip each of them with an AI (orders which are bound to conditions), which alone will direct your robots' actions during battle. So the game is very much about anticipation (thinking, predicting) rather than reaction. You need to watch your replays closely to evaluate your team's weaknesses and then change your AIs accordingly. You'll find yourself in a feedback loop. And as the core gamemode pitches your team against the teams of other human players, there's always something to learn and improve (you cannot see your opponent's AIs, only the behaviour of their bots).  My impression is that Gladiabots has a very decent tactical depth as it offers plenty tactical intricacies that you need to consider if you want to become a famous robot-boach. For example, all (of the 4) robot-types come with a regenerating shield. Therefore, spreading out your opponent's damage and limiting your robots' time under fire is paramount. This usually requires your team to have good cohesion. You need to keep your bots in a formation, so that a bot whose shield is down can retreat behind his allies and regenerate. Also, target selection plays a major role, especially for bot-types who need a lot of time to zero-in on their target (sniper, machine gun). Moreover, you can't just concentrate on destroying all enemy robots - you also need to keep in mind that the game is decided by the score (you need to pick up little tokens and deliver them to your ""goals""). And these are just a few factors I learned about in my first two days of playing the game. Even though there is a large number of components that you can use to build your AIs, most of them are quite intuitive and easy to understand. Despite having only very little hobby-experience in programing, I had no troubles to understand how the AIs work and are evaluated during battle. And as the battles themselves are very transparent (you can always check which part of a robot's AI is active/getting processed at the moment), can be paused and rewind, the game is very well suited for slow, pondering armchair generals like myself.  Even if you're not into the robots theme: If you like tactical thinking and have fun designing creative strategies and battle-plans, you should try this game! In many ways, it reminds me of a sports game! Also, battles are quite short and fresh (5 minutes if you watch at normal speed), so be warned, you will be asking for ""Just one more round"" quite a lot!"

(1) The room for creativity when creating the AIs are pretty good, and it still seems to have a lot of room to expand if the game devs want it to. (2) The only thing limiting you at this point from unlocking custom colors and skins is the amount you play, meaning that there isn't any pay-to-win in this game. The only thing that effects the outcome of the game, (and thus your rank and level) is your own intellect. (3) At this stage in development there seem to be very few (if any) bugs.

The programming aspect of the game and the potential to play ""instant action"" scenarios similar to Activision and Blizzard offerings is what made me purchasse this.I'm at the age (56 as of this typefest) where I'm changing my gaming pursuits to things that encourage me to be mentally active. A thinking brain is a brain less likely to suffer from age-related dementia and sandbox games are the perfect tonic. Build something to see if it works in order to complete a challenge. I've also enjoyed playing the ""instant action"" aspects of games like Warcraft III and Starcraft in order to study the game mechanics better and to create challenging scenarios to solve. It's why a lot of my games in my Steam library are from a sandbox bent, or at least offer a sandbox aspect to play.I came across Gladiabots based on several things that initially attracted my attention:* it has programming in it* it has a sandbox featureand having enjoyed Exapunks a great deal because it too offered both those things as well as an enjoyable single-player story-driven campaign, I put it on my wishlist to buy when it came on sale and for this Winter Sale of 2020 it did become available.My first impressions were positive: the game design was gorgeous, ran very smoothly on my laptop (which is a middle of the road machine), and had a fairly organized tutorial setup. The thing that begin my change of opinion was the tutorial not doing a great job explaining things. Now, open disclosure: I was an I.T. guy for 20 years, having been a programmer and system administrator. I know my way around computers from PCs to midrange machines like the AS/400, so explaining how Glaliabots operate shouldn't be too hard for me to grasp. The tutorial explanations were fairly skimpy on detail, glossing over things that should have been at least mentioned, and in some segments were glitchy, the latter requiring a restart of the segment to kick the tutorial into action.The interface itself, while slick in appearance, was not standardized so certain prompts like the previous screen back were not in the same place, so you had to look for it. I got the impression the interface was designed in a series of bursts rather than methodically follow a template over time. There's no tooltips, some things that look like icons to click (like the one that's paried with the question mark) but appear to be nonfunctional, and features that don't fully explain what they do. It's not an easy to follow layout which can lead to interpretations that are erroneous. The AI programming reminds me of another product I reviewed (While True(): Learn) where it's not really programming but a sort of fuzzy logic setup with blocks that perform a particular task. I was hoping for something more like Exapunks where you're actually writing programs to make the Gladiabot go. The way the blocks are to be set up is pretty much a dog's breakfast, reminding me more of an company's organization chart designed by HR. Then again, considering what a joke department HR is probably explains why the logic design looks like a dog's breakfast but I'll leave describing the roots behind my hatred of HR for another time. I will mention the programming setup is pretty confusing, and with the aforementioned tutorial being both buggy and not doing a great job teaching what needs to be understood, that makes trying to figure out how to make the Gladiabot go all the more trying.The sandbox is HORRIBLE. I've played a lot of sandbox games and also games that offer a sandboxesque design through ""instant action"" where you can create scenarios involving precision player placement on a user-designed map, the level of difficulty for each AI player, and the team setups for both human and AI players. Some of these games are from 30 years ago and you would think Gladiabots with a much smaller premise ----- basically fighting in a small self-contained arena --- would allow a fair bit of customization close to what I described. Whether it's because things are not apparently clear due to poor interface design (such as the numbered Set buttons in team setup) or that the sandbox was slapped on as an afterthought, the sandbox is pretty substandard to what I was expecting, particularly since a sandbox offers a lot of things to the player:* long product play life.* experimentation of game mechanics* design of scenarios with varying levels of difficulties that require a goal to be reached.* just good-ol'-fashioned goofing around.Asking questions about the game, or suggesting things to improve on the design, particularly with my very long background of playing computer games over several design evolutions, is something I found out to be a mistake doing. The player community has demonstrated either indifference, derision and even open hostility to my questions and comments when I offered them. One player had the gall to state I shouldn't compare Gladiabot's sandbox configuration to ""ancient games"" like Warcraft III or Starcraft. Okay, so just because something is old it's a bad design? Hey, player Gilberreke on Discord, have you even played these games? The sandbox aspect of both those games through the ""instant action"" mode would outclass, outrank, and outperform anything currently offered in the much newer, more graphically aesthetic design offered by Gladiabots. Try those games sometime. You'll see what I mean.I think such an attitude comes from the fact Gladiabots is primarily a PvP game, and I've experience such toxicity from gaming communities like EVE Online or the PvP elements of MMOs such as WoW. The get guid bunch that takes suggestions and questions as a kind of weakness and personal failure, and not at all helpful to those new to the game. I've always said such attitudes are anathema to a game's success and Gladiabots could risk itself deserving a niche market rather than enjoy greater success. The game has a good premise, has a lot of promise, but must be open to improvement through better design and the input of players like myself. If you're thinking of giving this game a try during any sale, I'd recommend giving it a pass, or at least wait until it has improved somewhat."

I do wish there were more player-controlled options for controlling the arena colors, but that's hardly a problem (I just want to see my custom paint jobs better! :P).With three different game modes to play in (capture-the-flag, zone control, and team deathmatch), I feel like I've barely scratched the surface on what a bot can do in my 8 hours of playing. And speaking of surface, the in-game currency is only used to purchase cosmetics to decorate your bots. That, plus asynchronous PVP means there's always a fair match to be played.

There are some artificial limitations introduced into what information is available to you: e.g. you can know if you are targeted even across the whole map, yet, you can't know how close to you the enemy is: all you have is just an approximate distance like short, medium and long distance (or something like this), which, as a result, introduces a tactic of stepping in and out of the borders of these distance zones to throw off the enemy's targeting. This tactic is called dancing. To me this is very boring stuff. Apparently, to the marketing team it was as well, that is why you won't see this in the promotion video for this game :) but that is what your reality will be.The game looks nice.

An initial look over it plus the high ratings and positive reviews and a demonstration video told me that it was worth the few dollars.  (A cup of coffee at Starbucks is $4 and how much enjoyment do I get out of that--and for how long?)An interesting characteristic of Gladiabots is that the programming setup will be familiar to some players, but it is different enough that having a programming background won't necessarily help, and it might even get in the way of someone who has only used one type of programming and has stopped thinking about all of the different structures that a programming language can have.  Fundamentally it uses decision trees, which are a series of logic-driven decisions that branch (and sometimes converge back together here and there).  If you can think logically and are attuned to planning things in a detailed step-by-step manner, then you will enjoy Gladiabots immensely.  You may also have a bright future in computer programming or engineering design.All this talk of programming doesn't do the game justice, though.  it's definitely NOT a programming simulator--It's a game.  The tutorials are well done and guide you step-by-step through the initial stages.  There are several different game modes from single-player to multi-player, so you can find one that suits your skill level and opponent preferences. The gaming is set up with a ranking system so that you'll play against others of similar ability.  This gives you a chance to understand why your logic behaved the way it did or didn't do what you expected.If you speak English fairly well, the Discord community may be the best part of Gladiabots.  The members there are friendly, knowledgeable, and helpful.  I expect to end up with some good friends from the bunch there.When I was much younger, I would pay $40 or more for a game of this quality (actually, games of this quality weren't even available then).  That $40 is about $90 according to https://www.usinflationcalculator.com.  It's a real gem at the current price.  If you like logic and action, you'll probably love Gladiabots."

I'm sure it takes a certain type of person to enjoy a game like this. The closest thing I've ever played to it is Screeps except it is a lot more simple. If you are vaguely familiar with how programming works this game will come easy to you. Otherwise, there may be a bit of a steep learning curve. There are plenty of customization options although they make take a really long time to unlock them all if you don't purchase them with real money. The campaign is fairly long and the difficulty rating for each level is the equivalent of multiplayer elo ratings. It's possible to edit your bots to specifically win at each individual level, but it's very difficult to design a single AI that can beat all levels. Overall, this is a very unique game and you can spend many hours trying to perfect the behavior of your AI. It's pretty satisfying when you make a few changes and start to ascend through the ranks.

871930,17,0,coeurdetigre,399,13,1,478.5,"April 1, 2020","This is a superb, unique game that deserves to be even more popular than it already is.The concept of the game is that the player designs their own AI via customizable 'nodes' (colour-coded tiles that the player can arrange into a logic tree to determine their robots' behaviour) which then dictate how their team of 4-8 robots (from four different classes) perform in battle against 'enemy' AIs.The logical array which the player creates (featured in several of the screenshots in the store page) can be anywhere from just a handful of tiles at first, to literally hundreds (arranged into named sub-AIs if the player wants) that function like a sort of flow diagram for each robot, governing their priorities and thus responses based on a seemingly endless combination of determining factors e.g. what friendly or enemy bots are doing at that particular moment, how far away they are, or hundreds of other parameters native to the 'check-box' like options that allow the player to refine what each tile actually ‘says’.The game deserves particular praise for its campaign, which in its early stages functions as a tutorial, progressing deftly from the straightforward to the slightly more challenging without ever telling the player what to do; rather, the game lets the player try for themselves in a series of challenges cleverly designed to cause the most frequently encountered hurdles to arise organically, and by solving those (individually, not-too-difficult) challenges one-by-one to familiarize the new player with the interface and using it to get your robots to do what you want.This progressive 'show, don't tell' approach is exactly what a game like this needs (to avoid new players feeling overwhelmed) and quite frankly there are many developers out there whose otherwise good games have weak tutorials and who could learn a thing or two from how Gladiabots teaches the player to play.However, the campaign (for all three game modes, divided into chapters, each with a series of individual challenges against progressively harder 'enemy' AI provided by the developer) is far more than just a tutorial: I think it may actually be literally an endless challenge, because looking at the global Steam achievements, only a tiny fraction of the playerbase has managed to complete even the first half of the campaign for some of the game modes. I guess this is comparable with classic strategy games like chess or Go, where most serious computer simulations feature the option to ramp up the opponent AI to the point where even a grandmaster would struggle. So you're not going to run out of singleplayer challenge any time soon.The heart of Gladiabots, though, for me is its multiplayer, because this allows you to take your painstakingly-put-together homemade AI and try it out against other Gladiabots players of a similar level to see how it compares. This turns what could have been a somewhat introspective- if endlessly challenging - singleplayer experience into effectively a cult e-sport where you absolutely can fight your way up to compete with the current top active Gladiabots players.The developer has made several excellent design decisions that make Gladiabots a solid, competitive, yet stress-free multiplayer experience.Firstly, the decision to use the established 'Elo' ratings system (or a variant of it) is fundamental in ensuring that players are matched very closely to player AIs of a similar level, so that no match-up should be totally hopeless (unless you are trying out a new AI and it turns out to contain a major error of your own making!).Secondly, the deliberate absence of RNG from Gladiabots' game mechanics means that, when two AIs are matched against each other, the result is predetermined: there are no invisible 'dice rolls' going on behind the scenes; the clash of the code determines the outcome, nothing else. This makes a close battle no less dramatic the first time you watch it, but more importantly, this non-synchronous matchmaking removes the need for both competitors to be online at the same time, which in turn makes the most of Gladiabots small-but-hardcore active playerbase.It also means you can watch replays (*every match is a 'replay', the outcome having actually been calculated by the game's server in a matter of just a couple of seconds at the moment the match was created) as many times as you want and at your leisure.It also massively multiplies the available pool of player-created AIs out there against which the game can match you, as the game has many times more player-made AIs than players.The game tracks your multiplayer statistics via a website which is a nice resource.I also like the fact that the rankings and leaderboards reset at the end of each ‘season’, meaning that there is fresh incentive to compete once again.The fact that your opponent isn’t actually present and watching (unless they are your Steam buddy and you arranged a private match, of course) explains why the game features no in-game chat so what community the game has takes place elsewhere (e.g. forums); on the plus side, the lack of in-game chat makes this a safe online experience for, say, kids who are budding coders.Also, you have the choice of ranked or unranked battles so there really is no disincentive to trying out your own AIs - especially new ideas or alternative approaches - against AIs written by other real human beings, since you are not risking your ranking by doing so.However I would absolutely recommend that you do mostly play ranked, as this allows the dependable Elo-like system to establish your current rating and thus match you against AIs from players at that level. Once you have got the hang of the basics, your rating will increase so that you are matched against AIs from other, similarly-progressing, players until eventually every bout will be close fought and your progress will inevitably plateau (at which point, by all means utilise unranked matches to experiment with alternative approaches at no risk to your rating).If only more games featured coding executed via a colourful, accessible, drag-and-drop interface rather than primarily text-based scripting (like in the ArmA or Sturmovik mission editors, for example) then EVERY game could feature customizable AI, rather than this being the preserve of hardcore modders.And more importantly, perhaps more people would experience coding for what it is - a learnable, logical system for telling machines what you want them to do - rather than the incomprehensible preserve of stereotypical ‘hackers’, bashing out green text while the Hollywood hero impatiently urges them on."

871930,10,4,Metakognition,920,37,-1,19.1,"February 27, 2020","Pro: Sleek, modern, and intuitive U.I.Con:   What the fudge is the rival A.I. up to?  When playing the single player campaign, the design phase is incredibly tedious. To put it bluntly, it's a waste of time.   Because in order to contrive an effective strategy to prevail against the opposing team on each level, reasonably, you first have to understand the opponents plan, and how it would react to different actions of your bots.   The only effective way to decipher low level single player A.I. algorithms is to configure your bot's algorithm with the default A.I. for the three corresponding campaign branches, deploy them on the arena, then observe how the rival team interacts with your ""probing team"" in slow motion. Only when you obtain a relatively solid grasp of the opponents strategy through this observation, will you be capable of coming up with effective countermeasures.   However, according to my speculation this method has two main drawbacks:    1. When your opponent's algorithm is optimized, simple actions will only elicit simple     reactions. Id est, take not a musket to kill a butterfly.    2. Complex behavioral patterns sometimes are build upon simpler behavioral patterns.     However, these complex patterns are often nonlinear combinations of simpler patterns.  On your pilgrimage to reach the final level of each campaign branch, the order of difficulty increases in terms of opposing A.I.'s strategic complexity, and this complexity is highly correlated with how seamless and harmonic it coordinates with its squad to achieve a certain goal. Since the average human brain can't observe multiple moving targets in detail at once, you will experience great difficulty in figuring out the grand plan of the opponent from a macroscale, because the clarity of the opponents grand plan depends on how well you can perceive the subtle interactions of regional skirmishes simultaneously at each instance, retain that information in your brain, then randomly access on demand. If you lack the working memory to utilize such information, you can probably hypothesize and visualize how this complex algorithm (pattern) is constituted from simpler algorithms (subroutine) with a coordinate system complemented with some numerical analysis techniques, but it is incredibly inefficient even if handled recursively. So this method doesn't scale well.   This process is analogous to reading the music sheet for a classical piano composition, without the grace and aesthetic of playing one. If you resemble each bot's behavioral pattern to a melody, you're compelled to play a piano piece with 6 or more melodies into a dissonant and artificial cacophony. Even if there exists such uncanny talent, that person probably has to be as well endowed as Franz Liszt with 2k(k∈N, k≥3) hands, k pair of eyes and a transhuman brain, and it would be a grave humanitarian violation to force such divine being to endure such gruesome torment.   So, whether single player or multiplayer, it would be pragmatic and pertinent for the developer to  bestow players the right to publicize their algorithm in game and disclose the entire content of each bot's algorithm in every singleplayer level as public information . Because we are playing a game for programmers to discern deficiency in each other's algorithm to exploit and surpass. Not for piano prodigies striving to surpass a cybernetically enhanced Franz Liszt in terms of sheet reading fluency and mechanical skill."

871930,3,0,bhaktivedanta,508,10,1,364.7,"November 30, 2019","In Gladiabots you programm a platoon of robots that will then compete autonomously in a game arena against other platoons. You have to plan and consider carefully when creating your robots' AIs before actually hitting the arena as you can no longer interfere once the match has started: The robots are then on their own, equipped with nothing but your programmed instructions.There are four different bot classes resembling a rock scissors paper scheme with an added tank and several different game modes (three for online ranked matches vs humans).The programming is done in a visual programming language: Programms reseble a tree-style structure (directed acyclic graph) that is traversed for evaluation in a depth first, left to right (respectively anticlockwise) order. The nodes of that tree/graph are either conditions whether to search a sub-branch or instructions.Conditions can evaluate a vast magintude of game values and variables like distances between objects / entities in the arena, health of own and enemy robots and actions of own and enemy robots, just to name a few. If the condition in a node holds true, the sub-nodes are traversed left to right.Instructions come in to variants: Modification of abstract variables that are only relevant for the code execution and ""physical"" actions of robots in the arena. While physical instructions stop the code execution and let the robot begin with that concrete action in the arena, abstract instructions do not end evaluation. This principle allows for very differentiated decisionmaking in each game tick.While very elaborate programms can be created thanks to the expressive power of the visual programming paradigm employed, there are also some hard restrictions to face when programming: A node limit of 500, no loops and while a node can have several parents, it will only be evaluated once, even if a second or third parent would lead to that node after the first one, when parsing the instruction tree. However constraining and troublesome these restrictions may at first appear to the experienced programmer who is used to vast resources and language features when creating her/his real-world programms, it turns out the limits represent in fact welcome challenges that were carefully designed by the game's creator in order to stimulate creativity:Having  such restrictions in place shifts the challenge of the game to the management of scarce technical resources from what would have otherwise been a task as tedious as to optimze a modern chess-engine for a few more elo points. This concept of scarce resources is carried forward in the design by widely replacing the common concept of variables found in real world programming languages with the concept of ""tags"". A bot can apply up to ten different tags to any object in the game. These tags surve the purpose of binary flags. There are 5 private tags per bot, visible only to the bot itself and 5 shared ones for the entire team. The only ""classical"" variables in the game come as 5 private signed integer counters per bot and 5 shared ones. That is it - you have to manage!Also the physical distances that the game exposes to the programmer are not arbitrary inetgers but range categories: short range, medium, long range and out of range. These ranges are the same for every bot class and apart from decision factors for the AI programs they determine the different bot classes shooting precision in the arena. Also there are no absolute coordinates to feed to the AI but relative distances of the mentioned categries and arena areas like ""upper half"", ""enemy half"" and others. This represents a restriction and an empowerment to the programmer at the same time: While we cannot implement behaviour formulae for the robot - anyway there are no mathematical operations in the game btw. - the level of abstraction offered by the programming paradigm is very high and the players can programm on the level of actual ""meaning"".Having done quite a bit of AI programming before after being initially startled by the very special programming style required in order to play this game, I have quickly come to love this innovatice concept. If you are like me and you have been frustrated as a child by the way too stupid AI opponents in your otherwise perfect favourite strategy computer game, ever since dreaming of once creating the ueber AI that would make the game a challenge again: Here is to you! This game offers the tools for intellectual expression and creativity on a very deep level in a fun way, avoiding the tar pits of technical detail that are all-around in real world programming.A fist-class brain teaser and tool of art!10/10"

871930,2,0,trollbeardsteam,52,2,1,21.8,"November 27, 2019","Fun game overall, if you like programming mechanics. The UI is very sleek and intuitive. The AI Editor is fun and easy to use. The tutorial, campaign, and sandbox modes do a good job to teach you the mechanics and help you troubleshoot your AI. It's a good feeling when your programming works as intended, and you can see the improvements in your team. The different game modes add decent variety and replay-ability. The tagging system in the AI editor is very useful and can be implemented in clever ways to get your bots to perform more complicated programming.Some improvements I would like to see: 1. More variety of bots. For example, it would be nice to have support bots that heal or inflict status effects like temporary movement, defense, or attack modifiers. 2. Adding some more useful functions to the AI editor. For example, it would be nice to program bots to move or flee in very specific directions, like toward certain walls or sections of the arena. 3. Less randomness in maps, specifically concerning team starting positions. I enjoy a degree of randomness in the maps, but players can lose based solely on if their bots start split up in unfavorable ways, regardless of how well they programmed their AI. It would be nice if the starting team positions were static. I believe that would make for more informed and enjoyable AI programming."

Go home action kid, this is a place for the cerebral only, and if you are autistic you are probably slaying this game with your brain powers.At the root of this game is a logic system which is represent with nodes. If you never used nodes before, it's all about making the right connections and placing them in the proper order. It is a system which is found in all kinds of software and playing this game will definitly increase your general understanding of using these so called logic bricks.The complexity you can create is subjectively limitless, the more you know and understand, the better your combat bots will act and respond on the battlefield. Victory is derived from the choices you make in their programming before your release them on the field.Again i just passed the tutorial and am both deeply excited as well as intimidated by the gameplay ahead, i see them logic trees and know how crazy large and complex they can become, this is a thinking game with a degree of depth that you will not find easily in other places.#PROTIPIf you encounter a problem in your nodes, know that the problem is always you and your understanding of the system. The bots are stupid and only will do as told by you, if the bots are not doing what you want them to do, you are giving the wrong instructions or have given them in the wrong order.To DADS and MOMS out there, get this for your kids because it is a great learning experience and has significant relevance in the real world. It is a form of programming without having to know and write code. It is very useful to even grasp the basics of these systems, especially when Skynet goes live and at least your kid knows how to hack terminators because you prepared them for a post-nuclear world filled with killing machines."

You have a team of 4 - 8 robots (depending on game mode), which you can select from 4 different types. Big tanky machinegunners are slow to move, slow to start firing, but can pour a lot of firepower onto the enemy, and are capable of taking a beating as well. Snipers are relatively fragile and slow, but can hit full force at long range. Shotgunners are even more vulnerable, but move faster than any other machines on the field. Assaults are your ""jack of all trades"" with no real advantages but few tradeoffs. Each robot type has its uses, but there's no customising the machines, only programming how they behave. You have a wide variety of properties you can assign to them, drag-and-drop style, with a simple, but comprehensive, tutorial to show you around.There are a few weird UI decisions (like the top of each AI set having a ""delete"" button that ISN'T for individual AIs in the set, even though it's directly above and in line with where you click to select individual AIs. I've had a strange glitch where a particular normal behaviour, early enough for me not to realise it was a glitch, was triggering in an incorrect manner. This actually caused me to lose a few ranks before having several people in the game's forum point out that my explanation of what happens wasn't how the game is meant to be working. Verifying file integrity fixed the problem, but it was a strange bug to experience.The graphics are nothing special, but the simple designs of the machines fit the game, and the varied paint scheme options are surprisingly varied, adding a lot of visual customisability to your team. I've gone for some pretty simple designs myself, which means I don't need a vast amount of grind to unlock all the patterns and colours I wanted to play with. You can spend a LOOONG time grinding for the cosmetics - or just buy the ""optimized edition"" or the ""optimization pack"" to get a stack of extra currency. The game doesn't use cheap lootbox mechanics, and the progression of earning currency is done at a fairly reasonable rate (I've heard the free mobile version is much slower, because Steam gives you premium account status since it's a paid release). Even without using any of the in-game currency, you have a set of greyscale options open to you, as well as the default two-tone colour schemes on each robot type. It's limited but there's still some room for creativity, and the more you play, and the more points you earn, the more colourful or detailed your designs can become.Once you've built your AI and sent them into a mach, you don't have any control over events. You can rotate, pan and zoom the camera, speed up, slow down, and rewind time, and once you see where the match leads, you get to revise your strategy if you saw flaws - or cool things the enemy did that you want your bots to do in future. It feels really good when you manage to bring everything together, and your swarm of robots captures location after location and overruns the entire map in domination, or when you manage to lock the enemy team down in collection with a handful of combat-focused robots while your collectors stay behind them and claim all the resources. Each game mode has very different requirements for victory, and you'll find your programs will progressively become more complex as you learn new tricks by seeing how other players' teams behave."

Assaults are your ""jack of all trades"" with no real advantages but few tradeoffs. Each robot type has its uses, but there's no customising the machines, only programming how they behave. You have a wide variety of properties you can assign to them, drag-and-drop style, with a simple, but comprehensive, tutorial to show you around.There are a few weird UI decisions (like the top of each AI set having a ""delete"" button that ISN'T for individual AIs in the set, even though it's directly above and in line with where you click to select individual AIs. I've had a strange glitch where a particular normal behaviour, early enough for me not to realise it was a glitch, was triggering in an incorrect manner. This actually caused me to lose a few ranks before having several people in the game's forum point out that my explanation of what happens wasn't how the game is meant to be working. Verifying file integrity fixed the problem, but it was a strange bug to experience.The graphics are nothing special, but the simple designs of the machines fit the game, and the varied paint scheme options are surprisingly varied, adding a lot of visual customisability to your team. I've gone for some pretty simple designs myself, which means I don't need a vast amount of grind to unlock all the patterns and colours I wanted to play with. You can spend a LOOONG time grinding for the cosmetics - or just buy the ""optimized edition"" or the ""optimization pack"" to get a stack of extra currency. The game doesn't use cheap lootbox mechanics, and the progression of earning currency is done at a fairly reasonable rate (I've heard the free mobile version is much slower, because Steam gives you premium account status since it's a paid release). Even without using any of the in-game currency, you have a set of greyscale options open to you, as well as the default two-tone colour schemes on each robot type. It's limited but there's still some room for creativity, and the more you play, and the more points you earn, the more colourful or detailed your designs can become.Once you've built your AI and sent them into a mach, you don't have any control over events. You can rotate, pan and zoom the camera, speed up, slow down, and rewind time, and once you see where the match leads, you get to revise your strategy if you saw flaws - or cool things the enemy did that you want your bots to do in future. It feels really good when you manage to bring everything together, and your swarm of robots captures location after location and overruns the entire map in domination, or when you manage to lock the enemy team down in collection with a handful of combat-focused robots while your collectors stay behind them and claim all the resources. Each game mode has very different requirements for victory, and you'll find your programs will progressively become more complex as you learn new tricks by seeing how other players' teams behave."
