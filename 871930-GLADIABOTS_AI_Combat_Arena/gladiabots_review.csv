0,2702,"Amazing game for the right audience. I have taken part in other coding AI games (Halite AI) and had a lot of fun improving my bot over the course of those tournaments. After they ended I always wanted more. This game nails the feel of those coding tournaments as well as simplifying the learning process with a very intuitive interface and a simple left to right, top to bottom execution process. It's simple to get into, but oh so very deep. I received this game for free as a part of the Tilt5 Kickstarter and I am so excited to see this game brought to life on my table with AR. I am just starting to scratch the surface of this game, but am already getting sucked into the rabbit hole. Nothing beats the cycle of fine tuning your AI, only to watch them do something stupid and have to go back and figure out why that happened and then starting again."
1,2700,"for old gamers like me out there this game will bring to mind an old playstation game;""CARNAGE HEART"",but more simplified and modern. if you've read my other review about another game then you know I'm using the most basic system to game with,and this is another game I found that works on it. this is a fine game made/designed very well,I encourage everyone to give this creation a try you will be pleasently pleased,the price is right and it's worth it."
2,2700,"It's a bit difficult recommending this game, because it really depends on what you look for in a robot game. Personally, I was expecting more of a robot-wars type game where you don't just give your bots AI to direct them in matches, but also equip them with weapons or tools to fit various roles. This is instead a true programmer's game. there are 4 pre-made classes and to win matches in the various playstyles of capture, domination and elimination you have to maken AI's that make sure your bots work together to make use of their strengths and complete the objective. Haven't played online yet, which the game itself insists is the true experience, so i can't speak for that part yet. I can say that the campaign is difficult. The change in layout of how many bases or other objectives there are and how far away they are can make the levels seem almost like a puzzle at times. To summarize, you only get to customize the appearance of every bot, but their AI can be edited to an insane degree, which you will need to do to win matches in the various playstyles."
3,2698,"Addicting gameplay. A lot like the game Screeps (an MMORTS of a similar concept), but requires zero programming knowledge and isn't even remotely as painfully slow as Screeps. Things get very complicated quick. You can stick to the campaign if you want (it gets very difficult later on), or you can play competitively against other real players AI. There is asynchronous multiplayer which allows you to fight other players AI while they're not even online, so the matchmaking is never stagnant, despite if there's a low concurrent player count."
4,2698,Wanna feel retarded? Get this game. It's great.
5,2697,e
6,2696,"+ Pretty fun and engaging. I found myself thinking on why certain teams beat me and what strategies would work better, then tested them and got immediate results. The core gameplay loop is great.+ A good intro to logical thinking and programming. - The menu flow needs work. It feels a bit clunky to go back and forth between various screens and often takes way too many clicks to make minor adjustments to your AI."
7,2696,"Game is fun and all, it teaches you the basics of coding/AI through an endless series of robot battles in 3 different modes.What makes this a NO for me is the terrible, terrible interface. It may look nice and tidy at first but it's a complete mess that the dev should have had fixed by someone competent, at least in some update.There are windows all over the place, menus that you can reach by clicking here and maybe there, different versions of the same menus, confusing icons in the AI menu, arrows that sometimes go back and others close an overlay, some more that send you to the main menu. Changing the team bots takes way longer than it should and there is no way to go straight to it after a battle?!? (you'll be doing that a lot). Even the playback controls are confusing.You have to create a login and confirm it by email, and you will not be able to change it or reset it. I came back to it after years and wanted to start from scratch but NOPE, no can do. I guess this was to push people to keep a single ID and compete online, but what if I don't care about any of that?There are links to all socials, shops etc. all over the place, I can see the dev tried to make this into a big tournament deal, but that came at the cost of the single-player mode.TL;DR:  In this game you have no controls of the bots, you do that through the menus, and the menus are an absolute mess. A game with potential, but ruined by bad UI and UX."
8,2694,Its like a puzzle/strategy game in which you create a set of instructions for the bots to follow in order to accomplish a certain objective like capturing bases and eliminating the opponent's bot.
9,2693,"Easy to get into, even for people who have no programming experience, and challenging to master. Absolutely love the ingenuity behind the programming system, very clear and easy to debug. The game is extremely well polished and I've not come across a single bug yet."
10,2691,"Easy to understand, gets challenging past the fisrt few levels. The UI and format make this more fun that most other coding games."
11,2690,"Played until reached top rank in 2017, had much fun on my tablet and PC as well. But... At that time I realized limitations of ""programming language"" of the game by means of which you script your bot's behaviour. There were suggestions on forum for several extensions, which never came to life. Instead, game was developed to enhance visuals and understandability. To me personally, since 2017 to 2020 game changed for worst, and I can say why exactly:* Visuals became swishy-swooshy, and unnecessary details, sounds, non-switchable direction lines between bots burdened my eyes for some reason (I don't say it is bad for everyone).* Size of AI scripts was cropped, while tools for comfortable and faster code organization weren't developed.* Considering previous point, new tablet-oriented and more casual interface made everything slower and I time spent on coding started to pay off less and less. I started to be annoyed by that and lazy to play.* You can't deploy x10 matches like back in 2017, you HAVE to wait until you have played single match. That, again, appeals to my patience and makes everything slower. * Game started to require more hardware power to run, by the way.Overall it seems like more and more obstacles to playing game have been emerging since 2017 in favour of visuals and casuality (probably to gain popularity among not interested in programming and equalize conditions for everyone). I'd love to play again, but I'll wait a year or so to try it out again."
12,2689,Nan.. get yourself PSP and buy carnage heart
13,2687,Flawlessly runs on modest hardware. Simple design hides a beguilingly complex gameplay.
14,2683,"Amazing game, just build a bot, battle em out, the bots are as good as you make them, so make them your best and they will get you far. You can use the ""G - Credits"" to buy skins of all colors and animations."
15,2682,"Excellent game, almost perfect. Is good to practice your algorithmic way of thinking."
16,2680,What is there to say about a AI program with a graphics programming language....about as much fun as programming in COBOL.   Pass.
17,2680,Like the game
18,2680,"Thought this would be fun, turns out to be more of a frustrating chore than anything else. Bought it on sale at 50% off and still feel like I paid far too much. I love programming games but the UI needs some work, the interface is clunky and not intuitive to ""program"" your ai in. The restrictions in the beginning chapters are an absolute fun-killer. I would only recommend buying this if it's 90-100% off."
19,2680,"No idea how deep it actually is. The actual game mechanics are very simple, and the tools for programming your bots are very limited - but so far it's great fun, and I've barely gotten into the campaigns, nevermind the multiplayer."
20,2677,"Game is just as frustrating as real world programming, but without the rewards. I keep playing thinking I'll figure it out, but I would not recommend this game to my worst enemy."
21,2677,I admire the ease at which I can code for these robots and it creates a constant challenge that allows me to put my mind to work.
22,2674,"Really Great game, still looking for some way to make my bot do what I want, concept are clear but AI command doesn't always go the way I wanted !!"
23,2674,"This games really good. However, I am officially dumb.I can't beat the second level... I made an ultracomplicated AI... It's pretty much impossible if you are semi (or > retarded).... I am having fun though."
24,2673,A game that is about pure strategy more than anything else.  Teach your little bot team to be clever and ruthless in the pursuit of gladiabot glory.
25,2670,yes
26,2670,"Pretty amusing, but I wish I could edit code instead of visually. The tournaments look like fun."
27,2669,if you like logic this is the game for you
28,2669,boring
29,2668,fun game
30,2667,"Gladibots is a solid 8/10 (not much help after the tutorial, a fair amount of resources to help)Gladiabots is a good game if you like programming and battlebots. The game requires little programming skills to start out with. There is a learning curve, but Youtube will help. When you beat the level you are on though, the challenge is very rewarding."
31,2666,"The AI in this game SUCKS! Jk. Game loop is you design AI for four bot types (average bot, slow tank, slow sniper, fast fragile) and battle them against computer or other people's creations in an auto battle, see what goes wrong, then tweak it. Developing new strategies (or copying them) is the most fun for me. I fought a squad that had a weird formation with two of their fast bots aggressively charging my guys up close... I didn't plan for that and got owned, then later copied that idea into my own coding.  An example of my general strat and some AI nodes/modules I've created: conservative defense, shoot from long range possible, push up if ally bot nearby is firing (suppression), tag weak enemies (focus fire), charge if weaker enemy fleeing (hunter), if low health but enemy is lower: attack (bloodlust), if we outnumber: attack aggressively without care (kamikaze), if no friendlies nearby and round time <5seconds: move towards closest ally (formation). Really fun. 8 bots, can have two of each specialist class, and each one can have their own unique AI. Lovely game. The fun is in optimizing the code and making your bots godly."
32,2666,enjoyable suffering
33,2663,"It works. The programming is interesting and fun but the game itself, sadly, isn't. It's probably a good title to pick at a very, very discounted price and programmers would enjoy it more than non-programmers but it's not really that much fun."
34,2663,Great programming fun.  Reminds me of Carnage Hart.
35,2662,This is Carnage Heart but better. Thank you for reviving this genre! Take my money!
36,2662,"Fun, simple and addictive. Very good for algorithmic thinking."
37,2662,"Finally, a game about making flowcharts!"
38,2661,"The game is really awesome, too bad they implemented the infinite respawn that f***ed up the whole logic of the domination game mode instead of creating a different mode, that's ridiculous, I hope someday they add the option to play like old times or go back to what it was"
39,2661,"I first played this game years ago when it was just a mobile phone game, i have always really enjoyed it and it has come on along way since then but it has always been quite frustrating, though that is really the point;If you like engineering and problem solving and logic then you may well get on with this game, even if you dont so much playing this game will at the very least demonstrate to you, literally graphically why software has so many bugs in it.So if you are interested at all in software development or are studying it, this would certainly be worth exploring.It really is very satisfying though when you manage to get a new piece of logic assembled correctly, or at least appearing to work correctly until it doesnt, but every set back just opens up more avenues to explore.There is a lot of content, solving this puzzle completely will be extremely challenging for all but the brightest people or those who are experienced and trained in the field but you dont have to be anything special to get something out of it, even putting together a simple logic tree can be powerful and its not that difficult to get started, thats really a big part of the challenge actually as you go along, how do i make this better without breaking it?Whatever your bots do will take time so there is an opportunity cost to doing something clever, it can be elegant and allow you to dance around some strategies but you must always guard against making yourself weak to brute forced approaches.I dont know what its like at the top end of things, I havent started pvp yet but it could be that the top players are simply those who have solved the puzzle and there is nothing more to be done, no alternate approach but I am hopeful that ultimately there is an element of paper rock scissors.Oh another great reason for playing this is if you have ever been that guy in a moba who thinks his team mates were the reason 'he' lost, well here is your chance, you get to pick everything that everyone does and it might not be quite so easy as you think to have a clear idea of what will ultimately win out.Everyone who ever thought it would be a good idea to back out of combat to allow their shield to recharge soon learns that that comes at the cost of ground and losing ground has many consequences, including but not limited to there being a limit to how much you can back up before your back is against the wall."
40,2660,"The game is really awesome, too bad they implemented the infinite respawn that f***ed up the whole logic of the domination game mode instead of creating a different mode, that's ridiculous, I hope someday they add the option to play like old times or go back to what it was"
41,2660,"Excellent robot programming game. Very clear, simple and logical programming interface. Programming is via graphical blocks so no coding experience required. Good tutorials get you playing matches very quickly."
42,2660,"TL;DR:An absolutely terrible user interface that ruins a gorgeously rendered game, a tutorial that is fraught with quirks that require restarting certain lessons, and a player community that gets uppity when you ask questions or even offer helpful suggestions or constructive criticism on making the game better made me wish I never purchased this thing, yet at least consider myself fortunate it was on sale so I wasn't too much out of pocket.[ul][/ul]Detailed ReviewDisclaimer: I enjoy sandbox games, and not really a big fan of PvP. The programming aspect of the game and the potential to play ""instant action"" scenarios similar to Activision and Blizzard offerings is what made me purchasse this.I'm at the age (56 as of this typefest) where I'm changing my gaming pursuits to things that encourage me to be mentally active. A thinking brain is a brain less likely to suffer from age-related dementia and sandbox games are the perfect tonic. Build something to see if it works in order to complete a challenge. I've also enjoyed playing the ""instant action"" aspects of games like Warcraft III and Starcraft in order to study the game mechanics better and to create challenging scenarios to solve. It's why a lot of my games in my Steam library are from a sandbox bent, or at least offer a sandbox aspect to play.I came across Gladiabots based on several things that initially attracted my attention:* it has programming in it* it has a sandbox featureand having enjoyed Exapunks a great deal because it too offered both those things as well as an enjoyable single-player story-driven campaign, I put it on my wishlist to buy when it came on sale and for this Winter Sale of 2020 it did become available.My first impressions were positive: the game design was gorgeous, ran very smoothly on my laptop (which is a middle of the road machine), and had a fairly organized tutorial setup. The thing that begin my change of opinion was the tutorial not doing a great job explaining things. Now, open disclosure: I was an I.T. guy for 20 years, having been a programmer and system administrator. I know my way around computers from PCs to midrange machines like the AS/400, so explaining how Glaliabots operate shouldn't be too hard for me to grasp. The tutorial explanations were fairly skimpy on detail, glossing over things that should have been at least mentioned, and in some segments were glitchy, the latter requiring a restart of the segment to kick the tutorial into action.The interface itself, while slick in appearance, was not standardized so certain prompts like the previous screen back were not in the same place, so you had to look for it. I got the impression the interface was designed in a series of bursts rather than methodically follow a template over time. There's no tooltips, some things that look like icons to click (like the one that's paried with the question mark) but appear to be nonfunctional, and features that don't fully explain what they do. It's not an easy to follow layout which can lead to interpretations that are erroneous. The AI programming reminds me of another product I reviewed (While True(): Learn) where it's not really programming but a sort of fuzzy logic setup with blocks that perform a particular task. I was hoping for something more like Exapunks where you're actually writing programs to make the Gladiabot go. The way the blocks are to be set up is pretty much a dog's breakfast, reminding me more of an company's organization chart designed by HR. Then again, considering what a joke department HR is probably explains why the logic design looks like a dog's breakfast but I'll leave describing the roots behind my hatred of HR for another time. I will mention the programming setup is pretty confusing, and with the aforementioned tutorial being both buggy and not doing a great job teaching what needs to be understood, that makes trying to figure out how to make the Gladiabot go all the more trying.The sandbox is HORRIBLE. I've played a lot of sandbox games and also games that offer a sandboxesque design through ""instant action"" where you can create scenarios involving precision player placement on a user-designed map, the level of difficulty for each AI player, and the team setups for both human and AI players. Some of these games are from 30 years ago and you would think Gladiabots with a much smaller premise ----- basically fighting in a small self-contained arena --- would allow a fair bit of customization close to what I described. Whether it's because things are not apparently clear due to poor interface design (such as the numbered Set buttons in team setup) or that the sandbox was slapped on as an afterthought, the sandbox is pretty substandard to what I was expecting, particularly since a sandbox offers a lot of things to the player:* long product play life.* experimentation of game mechanics* design of scenarios with varying levels of difficulties that require a goal to be reached.* just good-ol'-fashioned goofing around.Asking questions about the game, or suggesting things to improve on the design, particularly with my very long background of playing computer games over several design evolutions, is something I found out to be a mistake doing. The player community has demonstrated either indifference, derision and even open hostility to my questions and comments when I offered them. One player had the gall to state I shouldn't compare Gladiabot's sandbox configuration to ""ancient games"" like Warcraft III or Starcraft. Okay, so just because something is old it's a bad design? Hey, player Gilberreke on Discord, have you even played these games? The sandbox aspect of both those games through the ""instant action"" mode would outclass, outrank, and outperform anything currently offered in the much newer, more graphically aesthetic design offered by Gladiabots. Try those games sometime. You'll see what I mean.I think such an attitude comes from the fact Gladiabots is primarily a PvP game, and I've experience such toxicity from gaming communities like EVE Online or the PvP elements of MMOs such as WoW. The get guid bunch that takes suggestions and questions as a kind of weakness and personal failure, and not at all helpful to those new to the game. I've always said such attitudes are anathema to a game's success and Gladiabots could risk itself deserving a niche market rather than enjoy greater success. The game has a good premise, has a lot of promise, but must be open to improvement through better design and the input of players like myself. If you're thinking of giving this game a try during any sale, I'd recommend giving it a pass, or at least wait until it has improved somewhat."
43,2658,"Great game. polished, smart, and fun."
44,2657,Awesome Game it's like nothing you played before!
45,2657,"Over complex and overpriced.You wont get very far in tutorial without making this game your full time job. You wont even be able to multiplayer without spending a year dealing with the complexities. If you have unlimited time, hardcore into robots/ai and the game is on sale for $5 then maybe. Why CONTENT FOR THIS GAME(DLC)?It is cool and a interesting concept, it's just not very friendly. I mean I wouldn't expect a dumb game in this genre but were is the balance? even fulltime gamers will have a hard time with this. Its easier to not even play this and go play somthing else then even consider diving into these  complexities. I really like the idea, but this just seems impossable to even get started."
46,2652,"Good Game Inside!You build your Bots with a node-blueprint-system, which actually can be read like a humansentence.To get your Bots doing something you just need a few simple commands, like movetoenemy/shootenemy, but after that only your skill determits the limits! An endless tweak-improve-loop!The game has four different Bots/Weapons to choose from and 3 differnet Modes to playin (Elimination/Domination/Collection), and some overlapping addons like a shieldedposition or healthdrops."
47,2652,This is a great game and also a way to exercise your logic.  I'm so glad I came across it. It is well worth the investment.
48,2652,Best game ever
49,2651,I'm interested.
50,2650,"This game is weaponized programming--great for any fan of competitive tactics or logic games. There's many levels of depth to the core game play, though even non-competitive types can enjoy the single-player game mode, which feels more like a puzzle game than the PVP modes.The GUI interface makes creating your own AI very straightforward, and the ""build, test, debug"" loop is easy and fun to get lost in. I do wish there were more player-controlled options for controlling the arena colors, but that's hardly a problem (I just want to see my custom paint jobs better! :P).With three different game modes to play in (capture-the-flag, zone control, and team deathmatch), I feel like I've barely scratched the surface on what a bot can do in my 8 hours of playing. And speaking of surface, the in-game currency is only used to purchase cosmetics to decorate your bots. That, plus asynchronous PVP means there's always a fair match to be played. If you get tired of ranked play, the game also supports custom tournaments.If you're a fan of mechanics like Minecraft's redstone, tactics games, or just want a game that makes you feel like a robot overlord, Gladiabots will be a fun game."
51,2648,"Strategic game, good to play to train dummy AI"
52,2647,Fun programming game of decent complexity.
53,2646,YOOOO IT HAS MOBILE AND PC NICEEE
54,2644,Smoke weed and program bots to murder other bots! 10/10
55,2644,Addictive AF
56,2639,"Great game where you build the A.I. of your squad instead of controlling them directly.  The levels start off easy and then ramp up in difficulty allowing you to start with simple decision trees and work your way up to building more and more complex behavior.  The level of complexity you can create is very high, beyond just ""retreat if I'm damaged, attack if blah blah"", you can do something like ""if your heavy weapon unit gets destroyed, regroup in the center and send one unit towards their sniper if there is a clear path, otherwise have a pair of robots engage their weakest unit and another robot rush the flag, unless their heavy armor unit is in the way, then fall back and wait for respawn, if they have scored a point before respawn, switch to my 'mid-game aggresive' decision tree"""
57,2639,I really love this game! It is absolutely out of the ordinary. I find the puzzles to have the right amount of challenge. They are enough to keep you engaged and without feeling impossible.
58,2637,"I suppose I have spent too little time on this game, but I find it to be just a dance simulator. There are some artificial limitations introduced into what information is available to you: e.g. you can know if you are targeted even across the whole map, yet, you can't know how close to you the enemy is: all you have is just an approximate distance like short, medium and long distance (or something like this), which, as a result, introduces a tactic of stepping in and out of the borders of these distance zones to throw off the enemy's targeting. This tactic is called dancing. To me this is very boring stuff. Apparently, to the marketing team it was as well, that is why you won't see this in the promotion video for this game :) but that is what your reality will be.The game looks nice. Algorithm designing of your AI is nicely done and is very immersive, so atmosphere is nice, but the artificial limitations like the one I've described and the disability to move to specific points on the map were a fun killer for me personally."
59,2637,"Very fun, once you know what you want to do /program, it's very easy and intuitive, but it's hard to figure out what you have to do."
60,2636,Its epic
61,2636,"I'm just getting started with Gladiabots.  An initial look over it plus the high ratings and positive reviews and a demonstration video told me that it was worth the few dollars.  (A cup of coffee at Starbucks is $4 and how much enjoyment do I get out of that--and for how long?)An interesting characteristic of Gladiabots is that the programming setup will be familiar to some players, but it is different enough that having a programming background won't necessarily help, and it might even get in the way of someone who has only used one type of programming and has stopped thinking about all of the different structures that a programming language can have.  Fundamentally it uses decision trees, which are a series of logic-driven decisions that branch (and sometimes converge back together here and there).  If you can think logically and are attuned to planning things in a detailed step-by-step manner, then you will enjoy Gladiabots immensely.  You may also have a bright future in computer programming or engineering design.All this talk of programming doesn't do the game justice, though.  it's definitely NOT a programming simulator--It's a game.  The tutorials are well done and guide you step-by-step through the initial stages.  There are several different game modes from single-player to multi-player, so you can find one that suits your skill level and opponent preferences. The gaming is set up with a ranking system so that you'll play against others of similar ability.  This gives you a chance to understand why your logic behaved the way it did or didn't do what you expected.If you speak English fairly well, the Discord community may be the best part of Gladiabots.  The members there are friendly, knowledgeable, and helpful.  I expect to end up with some good friends from the bunch there.When I was much younger, I would pay $40 or more for a game of this quality (actually, games of this quality weren't even available then).  That $40 is about $90 according to https://www.usinflationcalculator.com.  It's a real gem at the current price.  If you like logic and action, you'll probably love Gladiabots."
62,2635,"This is my favorite kind of activity encapsulated in a game; it's a massive open-ended puzzle with ""no wrong answer""*. There are so many strategies I want to try and functionalities I want to try to implement. Unfortunately, I just don't have the time to play this game the way I want to.Bottom line: If you love problem solving and have some time to spend, this is an awesome addition to your collection at a very reasonable price.*If you care about winning matches, be aware that wrong answers 100% exist and that your first attempts will probably be in that set of answers. But that's what makes this process fulfilling."
63,2635,This is an awesome game. I haven't been addicted to a game in a very long time but this was fresh and very interesting. I love it.
64,2635,This is going to eat up a lot of my time.
65,2635,It's great fun. fairly addictive but the 'AI' doesn't check if statements properly. So it's still luck if the 'AI' actually does what you tell it to.
66,2634,I have wanted to see configurable AI in RTS games for a long time now. I'm so glad to see this game mechanic finally come to life and it is everything I thought it could be. This game is a blast and I recommend everyone get it!
67,2634,"I first got a non-Steam version of this game in a bundle. I enjoyed it so much that I bought the mobile version as well as the Steam version. It's nice that whatever version of the game you have you can sync your AI and progress between them all.Gladiabots is a very niche game. I'm sure it takes a certain type of person to enjoy a game like this. The closest thing I've ever played to it is Screeps except it is a lot more simple. If you are vaguely familiar with how programming works this game will come easy to you. Otherwise, there may be a bit of a steep learning curve. There are plenty of customization options although they make take a really long time to unlock them all if you don't purchase them with real money. The campaign is fairly long and the difficulty rating for each level is the equivalent of multiplayer elo ratings. It's possible to edit your bots to specifically win at each individual level, but it's very difficult to design a single AI that can beat all levels. Overall, this is a very unique game and you can spend many hours trying to perfect the behavior of your AI. It's pretty satisfying when you make a few changes and start to ascend through the ranks. If you are into programming or enjoy complex logic puzzles, this game is great. If not, you may want to avoid this game."
68,2634,this game remind me about dragon age origin
69,2634,This game is SO COOL! If you like programming you'll get addicted
70,2633,"This is an early review: In the short time I've played I can say this game exceeds my expectations.Programmable instructions are wide ranging but clear with no need for any sort of programming background beyond an appreciation machines will always follow a particular order (in this case left to right).The graphics and automated camera are pleasing to watch your AI play out, but there is fast forward option to skip through any predictable portions.At present I expect this game will be one I sink quite a few happy hours into, and will return to periodically. If you like Frozen Synapse I expect you would like this."
71,2632,"Ever thought your game's AI was too easy? Well here YOU are in charge of that AI.Here skill and reflection determine level, NOT the repetitive watching of adds, nor the wallet.Active and welcoming Discord community.A rare jewel."
72,2631,Great cerebral fun.
73,2631,"Although there is a tough learning curve, it is very rewarding! There is also an incredibly helpful subreddit and discord channel specifically for this game. If you are into strategic and games that make you think, as well as reward you for learning. This game is for you!"
74,2631,"Challenging, but fun. It is nice that it works across android and on the PC. A refreshing change to the money grabbing games on the android store."
75,2631,"I'm not one for long reviews but suffice it to say, this game is both challenging and deep.  When you start building your AI for your bots It walks you through the click and drop programming so you understand the general concepts.  Once you get the hang of it the game seems to take off the training wheels and let you explore your own creativity.  Before you know it you'll be making complex AI routines that do all sorts of cool things. A very intuitive programming interface allows anyone experienced or not to build the AI in minutes and yet still remain a challenge because the perfect AI is never achieved.  I'm loving it."
76,2630,I have no idea what I'm doing half the time but it's fun!
77,2629,THIS GAME'S SO ADDICTING!!!! ITS SO FUN TO PLAY! the battles are entertaining to watch and the achievements are funny to get i cant really explain more ITS JUST SO GOOD!!!
78,2629,"if you like programming, this is the game for you"
79,2629,Just spent 18 hours programming bots. My parents are wondering what drugs I'm on because I have dark circles  under my eyes. They wouldn't understand....But you would. 69 / 10 gold stars
80,2627,It's a cool game for people who like programming but has week skills in robot construction.Another similar games where needed write the code does not grand such much fan.
81,2627,Excellent game.
82,2626,"Reminds me of the old game Robot Wars that I had for my Apple II+, great fun"
83,2626,one of the best games i have ever played. its so good! you can make simple a AI and very complicated  ones. and failing a level is not frusterating because you see what the robot was doing and fix it. its a shoter game that forces you to make your own puzzle! i am in love with this game 10/10
84,2626,fun
85,2626,"Requires some thought, but it is indeed a very unique game, totally recomended."
86,2625,"Ai ai ai!To be honest, there's not a speck of actual artificial intelligence in this game: Your algorythms do not have the capacity to learn. But that being told, it is an incredible piece of creative logic puzzle, where your puzzled-up logic tree has to beat the others. Anytime your algorythm fails, you can rewatch the events and trace every decission it makes step by step in order to get a hunch how to tweak the laid out puzzle.The one learning aren't the robots. It's you.Welcome to the programmers' world."
87,2624,Very fun symbolic programming game!You can get surprisingly complex behaviors going fairly quickly but working out the best strategy is an ongoing challenge.
88,2624,"I already played this game a long time on android, and now am also starting to play more on the steam version. For me Gladiabots is a game that fits perfectly in a spot that was empty so far. It's a logic based fight game, where you can manage to buid huge and small ais, letting your creativity flow, without needing any prior programming knowledge. With different game Modes, an online multiplayer and frequent fun tournaments, i really enjoy playing it all the time. I would definetly recommend it for everyone who enjoys puzzle and strategy games, no matter the age. After maybe 15 minutes of Tutorial, the concept is clear, yet even after years you can still come up with new ideas, no one thought of so far. Personally one of, or even the best Game I own and play."
89,2624,"I've just started playing the game, and it's great!  Gladiabots is pretty much programming without having to remember the syntax.  I recommend you try it out. 9/10Also, cAmPaIgN aI tOo Op PlZ nErF."
90,2624,Masterpiece !
91,2624,Really solid gameplay. Found myself limited by my own intelligence instead of by the mechanics. Well done.
92,2624,"This is by and far the most interesting game I have ever played. I only have an introductory knowledge in computer programming, but this game really focuses on logic and order. Every time I think I have made an incredible build, I get destroyed and have to rethink my logic. It keeps me engaged the entire time. Thank you for developing this. I truly enjoy it. Cheers."
93,2623,pure nerd paradise - the best ai combat programming sim since Omega on the Amiga.
94,2623,Nothing better than a game where your team does exactly what you tell it to do.
95,2623,"Well I've been wanting this for a while, It went on sale so I decided to buy it because I wanted something to get me thinking about AI and how I should go about it in Unity.. not actually realising it was made in Unity which I could tell straight away.. It's more in-depth than I expected.. Also seems like a good time to buy this with the new update & sale being on.."
96,2623,"A fun game for anyone who likes to take their time to craft the perfect strategy.  Perfect for anyone who spends undue amounts of time in Fire Emblem menus. If you like coding, that's a great bonus."
97,2621,"This is a superb, unique game that deserves to be even more popular than it already is.The concept of the game is that the player designs their own AI via customizable 'nodes' (colour-coded tiles that the player can arrange into a logic tree to determine their robots' behaviour) which then dictate how their team of 4-8 robots (from four different classes) perform in battle against 'enemy' AIs.The logical array which the player creates (featured in several of the screenshots in the store page) can be anywhere from just a handful of tiles at first, to literally hundreds (arranged into named sub-AIs if the player wants) that function like a sort of flow diagram for each robot, governing their priorities and thus responses based on a seemingly endless combination of determining factors e.g. what friendly or enemy bots are doing at that particular moment, how far away they are, or hundreds of other parameters native to the 'check-box' like options that allow the player to refine what each tile actually says.The game deserves particular praise for its campaign, which in its early stages functions as a tutorial, progressing deftly from the straightforward to the slightly more challenging without ever telling the player what to do; rather, the game lets the player try for themselves in a series of challenges cleverly designed to cause the most frequently encountered hurdles to arise organically, and by solving those (individually, not-too-difficult) challenges one-by-one to familiarize the new player with the interface and using it to get your robots to do what you want.This progressive 'show, don't tell' approach is exactly what a game like this needs (to avoid new players feeling overwhelmed) and quite frankly there are many developers out there whose otherwise good games have weak tutorials and who could learn a thing or two from how Gladiabots teaches the player to play.However, the campaign (for all three game modes, divided into chapters, each with a series of individual challenges against progressively harder 'enemy' AI provided by the developer) is far more than just a tutorial: I think it may actually be literally an endless challenge, because looking at the global Steam achievements, only a tiny fraction of the playerbase has managed to complete even the first half of the campaign for some of the game modes. I guess this is comparable with classic strategy games like chess or Go, where most serious computer simulations feature the option to ramp up the opponent AI to the point where even a grandmaster would struggle. So you're not going to run out of singleplayer challenge any time soon.The heart of Gladiabots, though, for me is its multiplayer, because this allows you to take your painstakingly-put-together homemade AI and try it out against other Gladiabots players of a similar level to see how it compares. This turns what could have been a somewhat introspective- if endlessly challenging - singleplayer experience into effectively a cult e-sport where you absolutely can fight your way up to compete with the current top active Gladiabots players.The developer has made several excellent design decisions that make Gladiabots a solid, competitive, yet stress-free multiplayer experience.Firstly, the decision to use the established 'Elo' ratings system (or a variant of it) is fundamental in ensuring that players are matched very closely to player AIs of a similar level, so that no match-up should be totally hopeless (unless you are trying out a new AI and it turns out to contain a major error of your own making!).Secondly, the deliberate absence of RNG from Gladiabots' game mechanics means that, when two AIs are matched against each other, the result is predetermined: there are no invisible 'dice rolls' going on behind the scenes; the clash of the code determines the outcome, nothing else. This makes a close battle no less dramatic the first time you watch it, but more importantly, this non-synchronous matchmaking removes the need for both competitors to be online at the same time, which in turn makes the most of Gladiabots small-but-hardcore active playerbase.It also means you can watch replays (*every match is a 'replay', the outcome having actually been calculated by the game's server in a matter of just a couple of seconds at the moment the match was created) as many times as you want and at your leisure.It also massively multiplies the available pool of player-created AIs out there against which the game can match you, as the game has many times more player-made AIs than players.The game tracks your multiplayer statistics via a website which is a nice resource.I also like the fact that the rankings and leaderboards reset at the end of each season, meaning that there is fresh incentive to compete once again.The fact that your opponent isnt actually present and watching (unless they are your Steam buddy and you arranged a private match, of course) explains why the game features no in-game chat so what community the game has takes place elsewhere (e.g. forums); on the plus side, the lack of in-game chat makes this a safe online experience for, say, kids who are budding coders.Also, you have the choice of ranked or unranked battles so there really is no disincentive to trying out your own AIs - especially new ideas or alternative approaches - against AIs written by other real human beings, since you are not risking your ranking by doing so.However I would absolutely recommend that you do mostly play ranked, as this allows the dependable Elo-like system to establish your current rating and thus match you against AIs from players at that level. Once you have got the hang of the basics, your rating will increase so that you are matched against AIs from other, similarly-progressing, players until eventually every bout will be close fought and your progress will inevitably plateau (at which point, by all means utilise unranked matches to experiment with alternative approaches at no risk to your rating).If only more games featured coding executed via a colourful, accessible, drag-and-drop interface rather than primarily text-based scripting (like in the ArmA or Sturmovik mission editors, for example) then EVERY game could feature customizable AI, rather than this being the preserve of hardcore modders.And more importantly, perhaps more people would experience coding for what it is - a learnable, logical system for telling machines what you want them to do - rather than the incomprehensible preserve of stereotypical hackers, bashing out green text while the Hollywood hero impatiently urges them on."
98,2621,"interesting game, its challenging, great concept but in the same time its quite frustrating, not because the game is bad, but coding the AI is relatively difficult compared to code using the actual programming language or script, its lack of variable or memory manipulation in general, its lack of iteration concept, all we can do is just create decision tree, and overtime the tree will build up huge and unmanageablebut since lack of tools is the same for every player, it still fair. its just not as realistic as how you create AI in the real world"
99,2621,Programming but for babies like me
100,2618,"Really innovative game, worth trying!"
101,2618,Really fun game.  Lots of tinkering to do.
102,2617,"Pro: Sleek, modern, and intuitive U.I.Con:   What the fudge is the rival A.I. up to?  When playing the single player campaign, the design phase is incredibly tedious. To put it bluntly, it's a waste of time.   Because in order to contrive an effective strategy to prevail against the opposing team on each level, reasonably, you first have to understand the opponents plan, and how it would react to different actions of your bots.   The only effective way to decipher low level single player A.I. algorithms is to configure your bot's algorithm with the default A.I. for the three corresponding campaign branches, deploy them on the arena, then observe how the rival team interacts with your ""probing team"" in slow motion. Only when you obtain a relatively solid grasp of the opponents strategy through this observation, will you be capable of coming up with effective countermeasures.   However, according to my speculation this method has two main drawbacks:    1. When your opponent's algorithm is optimized, simple actions will only elicit simple     reactions. Id est, take not a musket to kill a butterfly.    2. Complex behavioral patterns sometimes are build upon simpler behavioral patterns.     However, these complex patterns are often nonlinear combinations of simpler patterns.  On your pilgrimage to reach the final level of each campaign branch, the order of difficulty increases in terms of opposing A.I.'s strategic complexity, and this complexity is highly correlated with how seamless and harmonic it coordinates with its squad to achieve a certain goal. Since the average human brain can't observe multiple moving targets in detail at once, you will experience great difficulty in figuring out the grand plan of the opponent from a macroscale, because the clarity of the opponents grand plan depends on how well you can perceive the subtle interactions of regional skirmishes simultaneously at each instance, retain that information in your brain, then randomly access on demand. If you lack the working memory to utilize such information, you can probably hypothesize and visualize how this complex algorithm (pattern) is constituted from simpler algorithms (subroutine) with a coordinate system complemented with some numerical analysis techniques, but it is incredibly inefficient even if handled recursively. So this method doesn't scale well.   This process is analogous to reading the music sheet for a classical piano composition, without the grace and aesthetic of playing one. If you resemble each bot's behavioral pattern to a melody, you're compelled to play a piano piece with 6 or more melodies into a dissonant and artificial cacophony. Even if there exists such uncanny talent, that person probably has to be as well endowed as Franz Liszt with 2k(kN, k3) hands, k pair of eyes and a transhuman brain, and it would be a grave humanitarian violation to force such divine being to endure such gruesome torment.   So, whether single player or multiplayer, it would be pragmatic and pertinent for the developer to  bestow players the right to publicize their algorithm in game and disclose the entire content of each bot's algorithm in every singleplayer level as public information . Because we are playing a game for programmers to discern deficiency in each other's algorithm to exploit and surpass. Not for piano prodigies striving to surpass a cybernetically enhanced Franz Liszt in terms of sheet reading fluency and mechanical skill."
103,2616,"Don't have to be a programmer to understand this game, you can also look for suggestions online if you're worried about the logic barrier. It's an extremely unique game with a ton of depth. Doesn't take long to realize that! I'd like my friends to try it out."
104,2615,"Best AI simulator. Very simple but still deep, great execution. RATATATATATT POWWW"
105,2615,"If you want a game to toy around and make robots explode? You'll get your fill.If you want a competitive environment with finely tuned balance? Look elsewhere.  also, it's free to play on android, sans a few features, so try before you buy.EDIT:ultimately I feel I was a bit harsh giving this a negative review, while I still believe the game has balance issues higher up - you'll spend plenty of time having fun getting there if you take it for what it is."
106,2614,yes.
107,2613,Pretty fun
108,2613,"Advanced logic-building system that can sometimes confuse you a lot, but once you get the right rythm and all goes as planned, you enjoy the master-logic you got going for yourself!"
109,2613,"In all fairness, the game can be fun. I think the main reason why I don't like it is that I work with machine learning algorithms everyday. I am incredibly annoyed by the fact that I can't calculate relative distances in this game and base my algorithms (game calls them AI's) on that information. Additionally, As someone who has no difficulty writing code, the UI is increadibly clumsy and slow. I would not recomend the game"
110,2613,The next generation of Robot Wars.
111,2613,Just completed training and it seems like a well designed logic puzzle that allows for an interesting competitive side that most logic puzzles do not. I bought it myself. I am motivated to continue and gain points to customize the look of my bots.
112,2611,"Complex and fun. Challenging. Easy to understand, hard to master"
113,2611,An excellent dive in writing AI logic via a simple to use hard to master interface.  10/10 recommended for anyone that ever wanted to program.
114,2611,This is great for programmers like me.
115,2610,If you're into coding this game is for you
116,2610,I like it
117,2609,"I like the game a lot. I think it's fun and a great way to do simple coding. My only real issue is I got the game originally on an old phone and I can't get it on my new phone because I don't know what the email I set up with it was. And another big issue is I bought the game on steam, and I can't seem to use the paid for version on my phone app"
118,2609,It's a wonderful game to get your feet wet in the world of programming.
119,2607,Make me scratch my head alot. Guess I gonna go bald soon.
120,2607,"Good work, and thanks!It brings a huge potential to the market, this game looks like a strong candidate for being top notch in the future.+ League system seems almost done, and it motivates to design better AIs.+ Neat design.+ High performance.+ Bug-free.+ User experience is best! 10/10. It's really easy to navigate around.+ Challenging single player campaigns.+ Domination, Collection and Elimination modes are real fun.+ Being available on both mobile and pc is a plus.- To be fair, the community needs to grow, there are very few people in ladders. I played 11 ranked games, won 10 out of 11, promoted to gold league easily and it seems I am 21st worldwide only 3 days after my first tutorial game. Why so quick? Oh :( So, as far as I see, that's the only ""down side"". I think, the game is completely ready for being one of the most populars. I hope to see more and more people playing gladiabots.Therefore, and all in all, I strongly recommend this game."
121,2605,"Nifty.  Requires you to have a plan, and know how to execute on that plan."
122,2605,"This is a great game, I'm not much of a fan of logic puzzles or or programing type games. However i'm a huge fan of RTSs and this was a really interesting take on that genre. The gameplay is rock solid (albeit totally mechanical) and the effects, sound, music, and ui give this game a really pleasant presentation.My only complaint is how they hit me up for my email address to make an account, my intention was to only play this game offline after all. but still It's a really enjoyable experience."
123,2605,"I just purchased the game, this is very interesting so far!! I hope this can get big and the community grows with it. This game is like chess but with battling robots... I hope I can also get good and make a name for myself in it. Also will there be more Gladiabots in addition to whats already here? That would be a sight to see."
124,2605,"I've found this to be a fun tool for teaching my kids the basics of how hardware programming works.  It's simple enough for anyone to understand, while being powerful enough to give the bots some complex and surprising behaviors.  I haven't yet delved into the multiplayer arena though."
125,2604,"Easy to get into, but you still have a vast variety of opportunitys to programm your robots."
126,2604,Fire and forget arena battle bots. A chance to engage in online multi-player despite an erratic schedule? I think I just found my new obsession.
127,2604,"This game is brilliantly fun for anyone capable of using their brain. Armchair strategy that doesn't require reflexes, ""special equipment"", or even being logged in at prime time to enjoy. Its all about how well you can layout a plan."
128,2604,"amazing little game, i forsee many hours of fun and frustration hear"
129,2604,"In Gladiabots you programm a platoon of robots that will then compete autonomously in a game arena against other platoons. You have to plan and consider carefully when creating your robots' AIs before actually hitting the arena as you can no longer interfere once the match has started: The robots are then on their own, equipped with nothing but your programmed instructions.There are four different bot classes resembling a rock scissors paper scheme with an added tank and several different game modes (three for online ranked matches vs humans).The programming is done in a visual programming language: Programms reseble a tree-style structure (directed acyclic graph) that is traversed for evaluation in a depth first, left to right (respectively anticlockwise) order. The nodes of that tree/graph are either conditions whether to search a sub-branch or instructions.Conditions can evaluate a vast magintude of game values and variables like distances between objects / entities in the arena, health of own and enemy robots and actions of own and enemy robots, just to name a few. If the condition in a node holds true, the sub-nodes are traversed left to right.Instructions come in to variants: Modification of abstract variables that are only relevant for the code execution and ""physical"" actions of robots in the arena. While physical instructions stop the code execution and let the robot begin with that concrete action in the arena, abstract instructions do not end evaluation. This principle allows for very differentiated decisionmaking in each game tick.While very elaborate programms can be created thanks to the expressive power of the visual programming paradigm employed, there are also some hard restrictions to face when programming: A node limit of 500, no loops and while a node can have several parents, it will only be evaluated once, even if a second or third parent would lead to that node after the first one, when parsing the instruction tree. However constraining and troublesome these restrictions may at first appear to the experienced programmer who is used to vast resources and language features when creating her/his real-world programms, it turns out the limits represent in fact welcome challenges that were carefully designed by the game's creator in order to stimulate creativity:Having  such restrictions in place shifts the challenge of the game to the management of scarce technical resources from what would have otherwise been a task as tedious as to optimze a modern chess-engine for a few more elo points. This concept of scarce resources is carried forward in the design by widely replacing the common concept of variables found in real world programming languages with the concept of ""tags"". A bot can apply up to ten different tags to any object in the game. These tags surve the purpose of binary flags. There are 5 private tags per bot, visible only to the bot itself and 5 shared ones for the entire team. The only ""classical"" variables in the game come as 5 private signed integer counters per bot and 5 shared ones. That is it - you have to manage!Also the physical distances that the game exposes to the programmer are not arbitrary inetgers but range categories: short range, medium, long range and out of range. These ranges are the same for every bot class and apart from decision factors for the AI programs they determine the different bot classes shooting precision in the arena. Also there are no absolute coordinates to feed to the AI but relative distances of the mentioned categries and arena areas like ""upper half"", ""enemy half"" and others. This represents a restriction and an empowerment to the programmer at the same time: While we cannot implement behaviour formulae for the robot - anyway there are no mathematical operations in the game btw. - the level of abstraction offered by the programming paradigm is very high and the players can programm on the level of actual ""meaning"".Having done quite a bit of AI programming before after being initially startled by the very special programming style required in order to play this game, I have quickly come to love this innovatice concept. If you are like me and you have been frustrated as a child by the way too stupid AI opponents in your otherwise perfect favourite strategy computer game, ever since dreaming of once creating the ueber AI that would make the game a challenge again: Here is to you! This game offers the tools for intellectual expression and creativity on a very deep level in a fun way, avoiding the tar pits of technical detail that are all-around in real world programming.A fist-class brain teaser and tool of art!10/10"
130,2604,"Yes, this game is about programming bots and fighting them. But no, it is way way way more than just thatThis game very bluntly showed people just how stupid computers are, and how much work, love, and dedication software engineers put into their work in order to make the stupid computers appear to be smart. And this is just scratching the surface.If you dig deep into this game, you realize that how well you do in battles isn't 100% based on how good you can code. It's a very time consuming procedure of drafting a strategy, refine it, make tactics based on that strategy, and then execute that tactic using codes. This game puts your problem solving skills to the extream with all of these.For some, this game is a great platform to showoff and refine their talents in software engineering. For others, this might just act as a wake up call, informing you just how many different calculations your brain handles when you're playing some other games and basically controlling one of the bots in this game. Either way, this game is extreamly benificial, and extreamly fun at the same time."
131,2604,Yes.
132,2604,"Yep, nice game. It's addictive. A lot of fun to program the bots."
133,2604,"I love this game. The idea is so simple, the implementation is extremely elegant (down to details like the automated camera, the music, the asynchronous multiplayer), the possibilities are immense.If only it didn't make me feel like a complete moron for failing to understand what goes wrong when my bots get trashed by other people bots, but even that is in a way a good thing."
134,2604,Fun and competetive programming
135,2604,there is nothing like this.
136,2603,Neat little programming game. :)
137,2603,"Only just started, but the style of gameplay is intriguing.  It is coding, but done in a nice visual way.  The tutorial really helps get you up to speed on the basics of the AI coding.  But you can't do everything. I am already longing for a way to circle around a dangerous object.  You see the bots when they have a tug of war between two opposing tasks."
138,2603,"Fun game overall, if you like programming mechanics. The UI is very sleek and intuitive. The AI Editor is fun and easy to use. The tutorial, campaign, and sandbox modes do a good job to teach you the mechanics and help you troubleshoot your AI. It's a good feeling when your programming works as intended, and you can see the improvements in your team. The different game modes add decent variety and replay-ability. The tagging system in the AI editor is very useful and can be implemented in clever ways to get your bots to perform more complicated programming.Some improvements I would like to see: 1. More variety of bots. For example, it would be nice to have support bots that heal or inflict status effects like temporary movement, defense, or attack modifiers. 2. Adding some more useful functions to the AI editor. For example, it would be nice to program bots to move or flee in very specific directions, like toward certain walls or sections of the arena. 3. Less randomness in maps, specifically concerning team starting positions. I enjoy a degree of randomness in the maps, but players can lose based solely on if their bots start split up in unfavorable ways, regardless of how well they programmed their AI. It would be nice if the starting team positions were static. I believe that would make for more informed and enjoyable AI programming."
139,2603,Really good programming game. Has me coming back to tweak and tune programs. =)
140,2603,"Robotwars without being forced to spend 1000s of dollars for electronic stuff AND without the annoing remote control. So it`s a real robofight without smashing buttons, which I find very intriguing.Just started and still trying to figuring out how to create a clever AI. But till now, I found a very large toolbox to organize my robots and to experiment with different approaches. Bought it with addon to support the dev to create more stuff for this artpiece."
141,2603,"This is a love to hate game.. the play time only shows that via Steam, but there are many more hours of android play also.  It is great and deep, the programming will challenge you and when it works its really rewarding, when it doesnt you start pulling your hair out as you try to debug/rewrite your logic..Have fun.. and Invest in wigs ,., if you are vain."
142,2603,Brilliant
143,2603,"If you're into becoming the next thinker. This guy is for you, the more you play the more you learn more efficient ways to 'program' your robot into behaving in different situations and ultimately coming out on top of other peoples 'robots'"
144,2603,A very interesting approach to a game. I have now played for a couple hours and would also recommend this game to others.
145,2603,Jogo diferente e que mostra que o mercado gamer ainda pode buscar por ofertar maneiras diferentes de jogar!
146,2603,This game is amazing. If you are interested in coding this is like a fun mini introduction. I havent been able to play a  ton but from what I have played it is a blast. I highly recommend this game to anyone and everyone. Just give it a shot why not right?Good luck killin' some robots.
147,2603,Great game. Easier if you know how to program already. If you don't you are likely better watching youtube tutorials than using the in-game one.
148,2603,Extremely polished little game! Gameplay is like writing AI code for bots by clicking buttons. Haven't played multiplayer yet. But the campaign is engaging enough for me to give a positive review.
149,2603,"Really fun game if you like gameified programming, or just weaponizing your autism.  I can sit here for hours on end doing ""one more round"" and tweaking my AI until I realize I haven't moved in 4 hours and have to pee really bad."
150,2603,This game is already a fairly fun and has the potential to grow into something great.
151,2603,Very interesting and relaxing game play. Makes you think. Also nice graphics. Fun to play but also challenging.
152,2603,"I just ran through the basic tutorial, this is the most fun i had during a tutorial ever, and it was challenging even so.For those who are confused, this is not an action game, your visual acuity and fast reflexes are useless here. Go home action kid, this is a place for the cerebral only, and if you are autistic you are probably slaying this game with your brain powers.At the root of this game is a logic system which is represent with nodes. If you never used nodes before, it's all about making the right connections and placing them in the proper order. It is a system which is found in all kinds of software and playing this game will definitly increase your general understanding of using these so called logic bricks.The complexity you can create is subjectively limitless, the more you know and understand, the better your combat bots will act and respond on the battlefield. Victory is derived from the choices you make in their programming before your release them on the field.Again i just passed the tutorial and am both deeply excited as well as intimidated by the gameplay ahead, i see them logic trees and know how crazy large and complex they can become, this is a thinking game with a degree of depth that you will not find easily in other places.#PROTIPIf you encounter a problem in your nodes, know that the problem is always you and your understanding of the system. The bots are stupid and only will do as told by you, if the bots are not doing what you want them to do, you are giving the wrong instructions or have given them in the wrong order.To DADS and MOMS out there, get this for your kids because it is a great learning experience and has significant relevance in the real world. It is a form of programming without having to know and write code. It is very useful to even grasp the basics of these systems, especially when Skynet goes live and at least your kid knows how to hack terminators because you prepared them for a post-nuclear world filled with killing machines."
153,2602,A number of UI glitches in the customization screen became too frustrating to look past.
154,2602,"Great logic design game, I would suggest adding more numerical function to make the game more flexible."
155,2601,"This is an intuitive game, giving you a new insight for ai design, and runs on simple rules/objectives/strategies. There is much that can be done to improve the game, but is non the less worth the purchase and time invested into the project."
156,2601,"enjoyed this one, look forward to seeing what it will evolve into."
157,2598,"The coding system is super easy to learn, but still seems very powerful. It seems like there's a command for everything I've ever wanted to tell my robots to do, and I've never had trouble finding the command I was looking for. I'm having a blast playing this game and can't wait to play more!"
158,2598,This is a simple game that is really interesting. Coding bots to kill each other. That is cool . I have been messing around with this game and it has kept my interest for a while. Running code and seeing it work is really cool. Bit of brain teasing .Nice work
159,2598,"The game is just unenjoyable.Tutorial doesn't really teach you proparly (just click here, click there), does not explain the concepts.After that it just throws everything at you and do what you want with it.Normally, you would go though campaign and learn all the stuff you need. But in this game it's non existent. Just random arcade games that are called campaign."

Also to support to the developers because of their friendly in-game request.Why I like this game: This gameplay is a good match for my personal preferences which involves pure creative problem solving and no manual execution (or hands-off arena combat) This game draws on many of the same reasons why I enjoy programming including applied creative problem solving, rapid iteration, observing results and course correction The asynchronous multiplayer seems reliable, with minimal waiting time for a match, and provides endless replayability so I can refine and test my bot AI Reasonably good tutorial for teaching me enough so I'm encouraged to learn/master the rest of the game on my own, though maybe this is a biased opinion since I did some research and had a rough idea I would enjoy this game before purchasing it This game always feels challenging which I enjoy. Even the early campaign missions greatly encourage me to design better bot AI Polished visuals and I enjoy enjoy being able to customise the skin/colour of my botsWhy I dislike this game: When it comes to designing very complex logic, which I feel the need to do because I want to improve my AI, I feel a bit limited. For example I want to be able to compare distance between two objects and pick the closest one but that seems to be very difficult to design based on the options given to us in game I would like more team tags than five so I can apply more to enemy bots Managing tags or team tags when designing the AI can get very confusing when the enemies have the same tag name as our own team tag (eg A or 1) There may be more things I like and dislike about this game but it becomes increasingly difficult to write this review if I include them.I appreciate any one who had the patience to read this far."

On the other Hand, sometimes it can be strangely satisfying to just click the ""new match"" button again and again and just watch my bots do their things. Also, being an indie game, it doesn't suffer from its relativly small playerbase that much. i always can start a multiplayer match in the gememode of my choice and won't have any waiting-time. Or play tournaments even if i dont have time on the specific date.Quite a funny concept that I haven't seen before."

194,2582,"This game is an intricate, but streamlined, programming game. You have a team of 4 - 8 robots (depending on game mode), which you can select from 4 different types. Big tanky machinegunners are slow to move, slow to start firing, but can pour a lot of firepower onto the enemy, and are capable of taking a beating as well. Snipers are relatively fragile and slow, but can hit full force at long range. Shotgunners are even more vulnerable, but move faster than any other machines on the field. Assaults are your ""jack of all trades"" with no real advantages but few tradeoffs. Each robot type has its uses, but there's no customising the machines, only programming how they behave. You have a wide variety of properties you can assign to them, drag-and-drop style, with a simple, but comprehensive, tutorial to show you around.There are a few weird UI decisions (like the top of each AI set having a ""delete"" button that ISN'T for individual AIs in the set, even though it's directly above and in line with where you click to select individual AIs. I've had a strange glitch where a particular normal behaviour, early enough for me not to realise it was a glitch, was triggering in an incorrect manner. This actually caused me to lose a few ranks before having several people in the game's forum point out that my explanation of what happens wasn't how the game is meant to be working. Verifying file integrity fixed the problem, but it was a strange bug to experience.The graphics are nothing special, but the simple designs of the machines fit the game, and the varied paint scheme options are surprisingly varied, adding a lot of visual customisability to your team. I've gone for some pretty simple designs myself, which means I don't need a vast amount of grind to unlock all the patterns and colours I wanted to play with. You can spend a LOOONG time grinding for the cosmetics - or just buy the ""optimized edition"" or the ""optimization pack"" to get a stack of extra currency. The game doesn't use cheap lootbox mechanics, and the progression of earning currency is done at a fairly reasonable rate (I've heard the free mobile version is much slower, because Steam gives you premium account status since it's a paid release). Even without using any of the in-game currency, you have a set of greyscale options open to you, as well as the default two-tone colour schemes on each robot type. It's limited but there's still some room for creativity, and the more you play, and the more points you earn, the more colourful or detailed your designs can become.Once you've built your AI and sent them into a mach, you don't have any control over events. You can rotate, pan and zoom the camera, speed up, slow down, and rewind time, and once you see where the match leads, you get to revise your strategy if you saw flaws - or cool things the enemy did that you want your bots to do in future. It feels really good when you manage to bring everything together, and your swarm of robots captures location after location and overruns the entire map in domination, or when you manage to lock the enemy team down in collection with a handful of combat-focused robots while your collectors stay behind them and claim all the resources. Each game mode has very different requirements for victory, and you'll find your programs will progressively become more complex as you learn new tricks by seeing how other players' teams behave."

201,2582,"Many many years ago i enjoyed a playstation game named Carnage Heart.Since then I have always looked for a similar game, which would allow me to program the mech moves. Gladiabots does not provide any mission, it is basically an arena fight between mechs, but the challenge of programming the AI of the machs is giving me hours of pure fun. Challenges, tournaments and online leaderboards make the game even more engaging for me"
202,2582,"One of the most promising games of the past few years, but also extremely disappointing when playing for more than 2 hours.Dumb, repetative gameplay, camouflaged with many levels + multiplayer.Seriously, don't buy it. Waste of money and time.//EDIT: So the develeoper deleted his comments to make this discussion look dumb. Thank you. I still son't like your boring game."
203,2582,Massively addictive watching your dumb little robots eventually turn into murder machines. Takes a lot of headaches to get there though...
204,2582,"Really forces you to think like a programmer, which is great if you're already really into logic puzzles. The programming makes up the vast majority of the gameplay, and sometimes it feels like the smallest change, which should have just been an optimization, now makes all of your robots stand completely still or just jitter around and not attack anything. So exactly like programming. All in all, a lot of fun, but also just feels like work sometimes."
205,2582,"The idea is intimidating at first, but I ultimately fell in love with this game. The mental effort that goes in to putting your AI together is high, but it is satisfying when you get it right and see your strategy beat another team. I look forward to getting deeper into the game."
206,2581,"Really nice game. I've fantasized of something like this on my early programmer days, and it brings memories of my younger self struggling with algorithms to make some Turbo Pascal games.Not a game for everyone, but if you do like this game and you are not a programmer, you should try becoming one. You will feel like Neo becoming The One after that.TL;DR: Great game if you are into puzzles or like programming. Excellent game for youngsters too, since it will boost their logic and rational thinking, like chess."
207,2580,"I'm a fan of strategy games that take a bit of thought and decided I'd give this one a go. It starts of very simple with some very basic logic for the bots, but it's rewarding to win each battle. When you lose, you often identify a flaw in your plans and devise a way around it. Then, you get another little win for yourself when you succeed!Before long your bots are targeting vulnerable enemies, group targeting enemies, distracting enemies, sneak attacking orbs, covering orb carriers. They're given separate roles, to collect, harry, cover, guard bases, etc. Then, more scenario things like what to do for the initial map rush or when it's a tie game with 1 resource left a new tactic is applied. There's lots of scope on how to win your matches in this game.It becomes quite complex, but the UI on the game is good and you can break down your logic into small chunks. I'd have liked a ""chunk"" which returned a true or false to re-use some logic, but apart from that, the UI is good and pretty easy to use.The other aspect I wasn't too keen on was tagging (Which can be used to team target something) - I just couldn't get it to work consistently and I stopped using that after a while. I found that I didn't need it and actually having the individual bots work cleverly, but targeting vulnerable enemies worked best.Sometimes it was difficult to keep track of what I'd changed as you tweak the plan, so it'd be nice to have a kind of ""source control"", where you save your logic and have a compare function to see what you changed and then ""check in"" when you're happy.In the end I got a nice team together and got up into the top 5 in the active bronze ladder, where I was winning 60-70% of the games. I found that very small changes made big differences - e.g. retreating too early left enemy bots free too much, or targeting the right enemy in one situation was the wrong one in another. A bad logic bug would cost you the game!As a result of all of this, you'll never get a perfect set of logic that is unbeatable. There's always that bit of luck with the scenarios, orb and base placement, who managed to just nick that central orb, etc. So you will lose games, but a strong tactics that do well in a wide variety of scenarios can make you very tough to beat. Some games are won in the first few moments and you can fast forward it, others are real tense affairs where you shout at your bots to finish off the enemy when you know it'll win you the game or when you/the enemy just gets the last orb over the line.I only really played the collection mode, with a few games of domination. It wasn't quite as good and I stopped playing elimination very quickly as bots can become very difficult to kill and these matches can go on for a long time with barely a death.I feel like I've just about got my fill of the game (60 hours), but I thought it was very good and satisfied my urge for a challeng. You should definitely buy it if sounds interesting to you. Well done devs!"
208,2580,Very satisfying and deep experience.
209,2580,good fun
210,2580,"What a great game! Not only is it addictive, it draws you into the mindset of a game AI programmer.The interface is polished and clean and it hands you all the tools you need to play with a vast range of tactical decision tree ideas.If you want to know more about what it means to think like a programmer - I don't know of a more fun and accessible way to do it."
211,2580,Awesome game in the genre !
212,2580,This is a brilliant game that's as difficult and engaging as you want it to be
213,2579,"Good for learning basic If/Else logic. I will try and skip any explanation about how these aren't AI's or even machine learning algorithms. Hopefully we all know that.The game itself needs a bit of polish but it has a hell of a lot of potential. The tutorial has great detail to get you started, and the drag and drop system is well put together and intuitive. I only have two complaints with the drag and drop programming system. The first is that the terminology they use is a bit clunky. By that, I mean that certain aspects of the game feel like they have been poorly translated to English from another language. The second is that there are limited ways to pass variables which makes programming a little difficult/limited. The limitation from variable passing makes it especially difficult to coordinate multiple robots and multiple objectives.Ok, drum roll...lets do the math... I have enjoyed the game for 7.1 hours at the point. We will round a night out at the movies to 2 hours. This game cost 17.50 CND$ and movie tickets are about 15.00 CND$ right now.2 hours/$15.00 = 0.13 hours of entertainment per CDN$ (Movies)7.1 hours/$17.50 = 0.41 hours of entertainment per CDN$ (Gladiabots)0.41/0.13 = 3.15 (Ratio)This game is currently worth 3.15 movies to me at the time of this review,"
214,2579,I bought the game to introduce my kid to more complex things than killing zombies and jumping around collecting shiny things. Hopefully we'll get soccer one day. :P
215,2579,"Really cool game! I love the challenge of taking as much time as you need to make sure everything works perfectly in planning, and then sending your bots into battle and watching as they follow your convoluted mess of a program to sometimes what feels like a painstakingly accurate level of precision. But finding the bugs in your programming for them is half the fun of the game as you improve upon what you've already made.It helps that the user interface is great, very friendly to look at and use, with shortcuts for a lot of things so you can do what you need to do fast, and looking back on earlier versions of the game, it looks like the UI design has just gotten better and better.I was worried at first that the online playerbase might be way too small for multiplayer to work, but then I found out that the people you are challenging don't need to be online for you to battle against their bots.Overall great game, been playing it non-stop over the last few days... It's a lot of fun!"
216,2579,Looks cool but can't even get thru the tutorial without game locking up.
217,2579,"The game was overall fun, but I can see why some people wouldn't get into it.  The game needs a bit of refining what with some of the few bugs and possible features for the game, but I would recommend this game to someone who likes coding, is not a master at it, and has a lot of time to waste.  It's all personal preference since the fifteen dollars was well priced to me, but this game would suit people with varying degrees of satisfaction."
218,2579,Very unique and interesting game.
219,2579,great blend of coding and gaming
220,2579,"Amazing game, easy to get into with good challenges ! recommend it to anybody who like programming or has some interest towards it !"
221,2579,"I was looking for an RTS game and I found this, I'm glad I did because this game is surprisingly original. if you like problem solving, strategy or mech games then you should absolutley give this a chance. The Developer seems to really care about it as well so i think its only uphill from here."
222,2578,"I really enjoy playing this game, I am doing a programming course so they AI building is fun. Making an AI and testing it, Then working out the kinks is a fun way to make a bot game.Definitely recommend this game if you like experimenting with different bots and ways to fight."
223,2578,"Overall very nice, although I would like to see some more programming options."
224,2578,"Good execution on exactly what it advertises. Extremely approachable. If you ever enjoyed programming LEGO mindstorms, this is probably up your ally."
225,2578,"Fantastic and very fun game! It's basically a visual scripting simulator with a game wrapped around it. Really fun and sometimes funny to watch the AI you created fight other people's and see how they react to different situations. My only complaint is I accidentally deleted the folder containing all my AI when I was just trying to delete one AI, and there's no way to get them back, so I will probably never play this game again...just kidding...probably..."
226,2578,quite good stuff. a bazillion ways to optimise your AI. Also cloud based the multiplayer is a nice idea.
227,2578,"Fluid interface, deep programming challenge, excellent debugger."
228,2578,"The game is addicting for me, as being a programmer and a player. I like the classes and the way you can make your own AI.I found some things we could use to upgrade the game:1- Being able to move towards a wall would make dodging a bit easier, and thats exactly what i struggle in right now.2- Shotgun is kinda whatever. Its fast, but its not that good at all. It really needs a buff.3- Last but not least, when I'm in the game and trying to do something outside the game, my lag is insane.My overall review is a 7/10 (-1 per each negative thing) and the price is totally worth it. Recommended."
229,2578,"Cons:This is a relatively short and repetitive game for players who are looking for something fresh and players who prefer adventure games. There is not too much content in this game for you to ""explore"" and not the kind of game that consistently rewards you for the time and effort you spent. There are no levels and items that you can grid to become a better player. Most players give up easily when they cannot seem to find a way to ""improve"" in this game. So if you are the kind of player I mentioned, this is not a game for you.Pros:This is a game about details. Sometimes 1 tick of delay of the attack animation will lose you the entire game. Perfect for players who are interested in coding. Some of the characteristics (I think) to become a better player are self-motivated, consistent reflect and improve, detail-oriented, patient, willing to learn, accept their own weaknesses and critical thinking. You do not have to know any coding languages to become a good player, but some coding logics are indeed needed if you are aiming to become the best. If you are this type of players, this is a game that will worth every dollar you pay.My thought on this edition:The added feature of counters really makes the game a lot easier so you no longer needed to create binary counter using tags."
230,2578,"So much depth to this game, I really hope the community grows and stays strong soon!"
231,2578,"Very Glitchy, drops frames. Freezes and crashes. (ryzen 2700x, RX480)"
232,2578,I played only a few missioonys yet but I was iommmediatly intrigued by the concept. I'm sure it will be fun.
233,2578,"Rarely write reviews, the game did asked me. And i assume it's a small team of developers.. They need our support like no other, competing against the big boys.So here i am... :) I find myself to ""new"" to know if it's really a good game or not. But it's already good in my book, that's for sure. AI was always an interest to me. And now i can easily ""program"" those bots.. basicaly a dream come true and for that alone i rate it positive. I'm stil figuring out who to write... ahum drag and drop a wel functioning AI, but that's part of the game of course. So is it good? Is it too limitting? I don't know, keeps me busy for sure. :) And i assume the devs will release some awesome updates in the future hopefully making it better and better. For now, it's already good :)"
234,2578,Great and unique
235,2578,great game and very well polished
236,2578,Interesting game. Never seen any other game like it. 8 or 9/10
237,2578,Outstanding way to learn coding!
238,2578,"I played this game since when it had about just started, back when the full game was free on the ap store on my phone. Back then I loved the game and had made a good A.I. and beat the few levels it had. I was enjoying it and was playing the mutiplier often. then the game released content that you had to pay for and I ended up uninstalling it. I bought it thinking I used to love this game, it has been a while and maybe it's worth the money. I got in, beat a few levels with and ok A.I. I made in 5 minutes. after that i encountered and unavoidable range bug. This bug, that hadn't existed back in development, made me realize this game has gone backwords in progress, and why I quit playing the game back when it was free, all it has added is a fancy game mode, respawning, some levels, way more A.I. commands then needed that were difficult to manuver, and more bugs. This little progress and a still increasing price just makes it not worth the money or time to play. The game quality has gone down with the price increasing. I am a sad the game turned out the way it did, and wish maybe it had gone a slightly differnt path. The game's orginal idea was what made me want to buy this game, I felt it didn't stick to that idea very well and failed to improve on what needed to be changed."
239,2578,Thank you for allowing us to refund steam!!
240,2578,"This game is really good, and even more if you are interrested into programming.Even if you don't know how to program, that's where it shines : Gladiabot explains and demonstrate AI concepts in the best possible way i've seen so far in video games.Well done Sebastien!"
241,2578,"This game will is unique in how it plays, and it won't be for everyone.  But if you've made it this far, you're probably the type of gamer that will really appreciate the depth and complexity that is on offer here.  A brain-buster for sure!"
242,2578,This is brilliant :)
243,2578,Lots of fun! Could be improved with better visibility on when conditionals fail/pass.  Maybe an AOE attack on one of the classes for additional depth?
244,2578,A TRUE masterpiece = 1
245,2578,"110% recommend!I've been watching this game for a while and when it went live, I bought it.  I'm glad I did!Pros:Comprehensive, easy to use programming system (I've been a programmer for 40 years but anybody with logical thought patterns should be able to program a simple AI)Easy to learn, difficult to masterConstant challenges to player programming skill as you progress against higher level opponentsGame genre might help spur people to develop an interest in AI either as a hobby or careerCons:Well, none that I can find.  The game is well polished, certainly in a state that could be called 'complete' (can't say that about every Steam launch title...), and seems to be void of bugs, or at least any large ones that I could find.TL;DR - It's good, get it, it might give you a head full of thinky thinks."
246,2577,1. Create AI. 2. Battle. 3. Improvise4. Goto 2
247,2577,Easy to learn. Hard to master.
248,2577,"This game saved me from a meaningless life of drugs and sex parties, now i have a new addiction - Gladaibots."
249,2577,"Program your team of bots to crush opposing enemy teams using drag and drop programming. Easy to get started, but challenging to do well. I plan to use it as a sneaky way to get my game-mad 12-year old son to do a bit more programming. >0)"
250,2577,"Awesome game, if you love programming, logical thinking and robot battles this is for you.Learning so much and I love perfecting my robots to dominate the battlefield, hahaha."
251,2577,This game is awesum. So many insights into AI coding. 10/10
252,2577,Fun and challenging to play. Nice-looking with great music and sounds. 10/10 would recommend.
253,2577,It's fun to play around
254,2577,Interesting concept. Worth the purchase.
255,2577,"I have really enjoyed the programming puzzle of this game so far, particularly because of the multiplayer aspect where you pit your AI against other real players' AI asynchronously. This allows the game to be played even when players are not all online at the same time.The game is fundamentally about designing the best AI. Create an AI, test it against other players or in the singleplayer scenarios, see what worked and what didn't, iterate, test again, etc. Did you program your AI well enough to handle the semi-random arenas and complete the objective of the selected game mode? That is the fundamental question of this game.Some negative reviews are complaining that the programming is tedious, obtuse, and difficult to do ""basic"" things with. I don't really have any complaints so far with the programming, but maybe that's because I'm coming from the perspective of trying to figure out what I can do with the drag-and-drop interface rather than starting with what I want to do and then getting frustrated by the limitations of the system. A lot of complaints seem to be coming from people with a programming background. Maybe they are more used to the total freedom that real programming has.Another criticism I've seen is that debugging your AI is difficult. I haven't had any particular problems with debugging. Yes, it is ""tedious"" in the sense that you have to replay parts of your matches and take notes (mental or otherwise) to figure out what you think went wrong, then build a solution, but again, that's the fundamental point of the game. I find it engaging to improve my AI over time. I can't think of any additional tools that the developer could have provided that would drastically improve my debugging experience.Again, I've really enjoyed my time with this game so far. It is a somewhat niche game, but if you find this kind of thing interesting, it can be very addicting."
256,2577,"Rating: 5/10I did not like my time with this game, since I felt constraint when creating and testing a.i..There are some free progamming games out there that are a lot better than Gladiabots.In Grobots` (my favorite progamming game) is it possible to create different sized cells, with different abilities and different behaviour, with ressource management and countless possibilities to create an a.i. that feels almost like artificial life.The drawback to those free games is of course a steeper learning curve and ugly graphics.However, Gladiabots might be fun for those who have no experience with programming games,so I give this game a thumbs up. + no programming expierence needed+ user interface with dropdown menu, where no typing is needed+ better graphics than freeware programming games- user interface is complicated, cumbersome and lacking overview- team composition is limited- camera is too rigid - unlockable skins give this game a free to play feeling- slow speed for testing- does not teach programming"
257,2577,Needs a lot more contents but pretty interesting already
258,2577,"I wholeheartedly recommend this game to any hobbyist programmer (who enjoys programming for programming's sake).It's usually easy to identify where bugs come from, but a good challenge to find ways to resolve them; in my experience, that's the most engaging and fun programming experience possible.I also firmly encourage players to join the discord, as the community is very helpful with helping you resolve bugs, clarifying how the ""language"" works (many of the negative reviews appear to come from misunderstandings that lead to frustration), and introducing you to strategies you haven't even considered before.Do not go into this game expecting an RTS experience. This is a programming game, so half of your time will be spent rewinding through matches you've played to debug and identify areas for improvement, and the other half will be spent brainstorming new ideas (solo, or with other people on the aforementioned discord).[Edit 11/24/19, grammar corrections]"
259,2577,"This is probably one of my favorite games in a long time. You basically need to build algorithms and get the job done, but don't have to worry about debugging because of syntax errors. You can run several games really quickly and constantly be thinking about what new strategy you apply."
260,2577,"Cool game that makes me feel like an absolute imbecile simply because of poor design decisions. I design all kinds of stuff but this game makes me quit. Quite quickly if I may add. It's too complicated to get the bot's AI to do what you want it to. For instance trying to get the bots to make some sort of formation before rushing in to get obliterated is just about impossible with how the game currently is unless I'm utterly missing something. The little nodes are more confusing. Why can the move node not connect to another one underneath itself, but the condition node can... Stop constricting creativity by making things overly complicated to accomplish simple tasks. It's just not worth the time and effort id have to put in, in order to get my money's worth out of it. For that reason I'm gonna have to pass on this... Shame cause I really like this style of game and usually don't quit so easily. I'll change the review if I pick it back up at a later date and things change.TLDR: Overly complicated time consuming design flawed high expectation having exceeding brain capacity styled game which makes you think outside the box JUST TO GET BEYOND BAD UI functionality to finally get the bots to do as you want them to...On that note, Good luck to the devs and sorry I cannot recommend the game."
261,2577,"Played it long time ago when it was in alpha, still enjoy it!"
262,2577,It is an excellent game
263,2577,"Great game. I easily lose track of time when making an AI for my bots to execute. The bots are only limited by your imagination. It's easy to get into, difficult to master."
264,2577,"Helloi was waiting for the release of this gamei'm not disapointedvery entertaining, it's a very good mind breaker , i don't have any liking for mind breakers  ( i never hang on with sudoku .. ) , but i have played the game several hours in a row and i never got bored.I'm almost sure to play the game till the end of the campaign  ( if i manage to succeed  ... )to concludeA must have in your game library !"
265,2577,"Great concept and very well executed, especially considering it's a solo dev job.  Full disclosure: I've been a coder forever and it's what I do for a living, so I'm a tad biased.  But I will phrase this review for anyone who's like ""ew, programming"".I'll skip the countless things this game does right, which includes making your own AI a very fun exercise.  And I'll get right to the fatal flaw, in my opinion.The biggest drawback is the closed nature of both the developer and community.This is one of those ""easy to pick up hard to master games"".  Which I normally love.  So what's the problem?  Instead of getting highly technical I will compare it to two other similar games and how this differs substantially so you know what to expect going in.Compared to something like chess (also easy to learn hard to master), the closed nature is immediately obvious.  If you lose in chess, even to a top ranked player, you know _exactly_ how they did it.  There are countless books and videos and discussions on moves and strategy.  Or you can simply watch what they did and learn alone.Example two, let's say you play a card game where you build your own deck.  You also know, at the very least, what cards were played against you.  And in virtually all cases I can think of the community, including top ranked players, are happy to share their creations with everyone else.This is in stark contrast to this game and my prime complaint.  Heck, even if you lose to the AI, you don't know what it's doing.But even when I squash a mission, why not show me what strategy I beat?  Lift the curtain so to speak.  So I can get a feel for my strengths and weaknesses and ideas on new strategies.  Well, you can't.  Same goes with online play.Why this is the case I'm not sure, but historically this is usually due to a problem being solvable.  If there exists a heavily optimized solution that should always beat less optimized solutions (think game theory, expected value, standard deviation, etc...), would you give up your perfect design?  Probably not.However, if it was something akin to rock, paper, scissors I don't think it would be closed.  It should be the case that every design or build has its weakness which would lead to the community wanting to share and innovate new ideas as the meta shifts.I expect most of the playerbase will become frustrated after hitting the ""glass ceiling"" not because they are losing, but because they don't know _why_ they are losing.  They can guess, but the game will not show you.  And that's when it becomes less fun.Edit:I eventually revisited this on request of a comment, and my review still stands as a hard no.  That said, I think it's a step in the right direction in a genre that will inevitably become popular.But ultimately there's an identity crisis here.  Namely, what's the target demographic?  Who is this game for?Is this about AI (which is in the name):  no.  Any real AI need to be capable of learning, which could be as simple as a neural network - which are actually extremely simple to create.  This is a state machine, and a precursor before learning any types of real AI.Is this about coding:  no.  Expose an API to code against and the developers would destroy non-developers.  And it's also the exact opposite way you want to learn to code (aside from very simple if/else conditionals).  If I was teaching C++, C. ASM, etc... I would greatly discourage this as a tool.  About the only thing you'll learn are simple conditionals.Is this about strategy:  no.  The game is easily solvable, if it wasn't a huge pain to do so with the limited tool set.  There is far too little variance for any real strategy to evolve.I'd compare this to a turn-based strategy game where you set up all your moves ahead of time, everyone plays the same overly simple race on a very limited map pool, and then you press go.  On top of that, imagine vague or completely unknown mechanics, which this definitely has."
266,2577,Very fun and challenging.
267,2577,"Recommended as a good challenge to bang your head against when you need a real brain workout.  At first this game was infuriating but the more time I spend with it the more I start to decode what it ""wants from me.""  If you're expecting a cutesy time waster, this is not that.  The learning curve is steep and it's not always entirely clear why certain things don't work but when you manage to get a good AI out there it really is rewarding."
268,2577,"I'm sure this is a fine game, but...Finished the tutorials, played first campaign mission, finally on my way to winning it. Halfway through the match, I get a popup, asking me to make an account. This 'popup' covers the whole screen.I don't want to make an account for my ostensibly single player game, but the only 2 choices are Sign In and Register. I hit escape, I *finally* get a Cancel button, the timer gets to 0:00 and I have won, but the game just keeps on going past the 0:00 mark. Fast Forward does nothing. Apparently without an account you can't finish any single player mission.Refund time."
269,2577,Good game. Been a lot of fun. Until I accidentally deleted my entire network of AIs just by pressing backspace or delete while trying to get rid of a duplicate AI I accidentally created... Yeah it's fun just don't erase everything you've made.
270,2577,"I tought game was ""free"" on google play store. So I wrote something slanderous on my review. Actually on google play store game was free cuz it was a demo (It doesnt says anything like that in store so everyone can misunderstand that) But still i find it really awful. Selling the game on PC, letting android have a ""demo"" version. If you want to fully experience the game on android, you have to buy somethings to unlock them. I think game has to be free on both platforms and if you want to unlock it you'll have to buy. But nope we know android users wont pay a cent for their games, we just gona release it free so when they get addicted they will pay us. Game doesnt has any graphics. They are lying about it. Game has same graphics on android. Maybe add some different maps with more colorfull terraria. You have only 4 bot types and you cant customize their stats. When your bots starts making a thing you never intended, you have to fix it by rewatching the whole game.If you like visually coding something, this game is for you. But this game has so much potential, yet they just waste it. Is this game fun? No."
271,2577,"I've been on the lookout for something to fill the gap Omega left behind, and finally - this is almost the real thing! Is there room for improvement? Yes. Is it challenging? Yes. Do I love it? Hell yeah I do!Dear GFX47, if you ever consider a sequel, please add terrain with obstacles and/or labyrinths with line of sight, navigation, and you will have an instant purchase! Also, making your bots more ""personal"" by adding robot pilots (we can customize) and RPG improvements (say basic robots can store a limited number of instructions) different weapons, chassises, faster cpus, missile pods, black market items that improve something but at a cost of making something weaker, etc. and you have an AA or AAA title!"
272,2577,"This game... is honestly like a dream come true for me. I've played similar games (like CodinGame Podracers) before, but they seemed to fall short. the depth of strategy seemed to be quite shallow, and they couldn't hold my interest for long. But this game? The amount of control given to you is immense. there are limitless possibilities of strategies (many of which will fail of course) and you can really feel how every detail in your design and strategy makes a big impact on whether you win or lose.This game also sports a very intuitive and simple visual programming system which is second nature to me as a hobbyist programmer, and should come easily to most anyone who plays the game with a little research and practice.Perhaps the best part about this game is that instead of only competing against a computer or trying to solve a specific set problem, this game puts you in a position where you want to work towards the most all-around powerful design so that you can beat other players who you will be put up against in asynchronous multiplayer battles online.If you invest time and effort into this game, you can climb the ranks and find your place in the leaderboard!I highly recommend this game, but if you've played other programming games in the past and specifically disliked that mechanic, this game might not be for you. If you're new to the idea (which you almost certainly will be, this game is from a very unique subgenre) and think it sounds cool? I think you'll love it. And for people who already like programming games, this game might be your new favorite."
273,2577,Incredibly satisfying and deeply fleshed out logic-based game. Greatly recommended to RTS players who already broke their wrists optimizing their APM in WC3 and SC2.
274,2577,"Good stuff, the logic covers quite a lot. SubAI's are gold."
275,2577,"2 hours.. and I must say I like it. Programming is fun and easy, drag and drop boxes.Fights are fun, because you can see what code is running for each robot.Its easy to learn, but it will take years to master.Now i have played it over 20 hours.It just getting better and better, when you fully understand the game.. and start to do small changes in your ai, and you see the difference.This game is one of a kind, this is so good!"
276,2577,This game really is easy to pick up but has such depth to master it. The tutorials run you through all the basics but then you'll spend hours iterating your scripts to grow in versatility and efficiency. I go to bed thinking of the problems in my script and wake up with fresh ideas to tackle them. Definitely worth checking out.
277,2577,"Easy to get your bots to do something, hard to actually be good. Good for a couple of hours."
278,2577,"There are a few programing-centric gameplay games, and this one stands out amongs the best for sure.  I'm grateful for the very expansive single player campaign.  If you like programming games, this is a must buy!"
279,2577,"EDIT:  I decided to come back and  look at this game again.  I like the fact that color schemes have been implemented for bots, as the gray bots are very dull and this should add some life to that.  I didn't relook at the combat, but I did go into the AI and check if any of my issues were addressed.  They weren't, particularly the one that was most important to me in being able to move toward a specific map position.  Rather than having to move toward a bot, resource, capture point, or powerup, there is simply no reason that people can't move toward/away from the center, walls, corners, allied/enemy sections because the reality is these zones are already implemented into the game.  Its just that you can only move toward objects that are closest to or on these zones.    This is a game about designing AI for a team of bots designed to compete against other teams.  There are three different game modes to choose from and four different bot classes to choose from.  The single player campaign is quite extensive with I believe 20 chapters to choose from.   The multiplayer deals with an ELO type system and the great thing about the system is that players don't necessarily have to be online for you to challenge their bots meaning even with a low population it can sustain.Given all of this, why am I not recommending the game?  The answer is simple.  While everything works, is well presented, not play to win, and the developer has done a lot to work around the problems, the ultimate question is:  Is it fun and is it interesting?  It is neither.Designing the AI itself isn't so bad.  They even give you starter AIs to build from.  You basically drag everything from a tree.  The game also explains how to create AND and OR conditions with multiple object types.  This is where I spent a lot of time, and it's legitimately interesting to think about different strategies for the different types.  As a programmer I enjoyed trying to think of ways to have bots to do interesting kinds of movements and strategies. The highlight for me was designing a harassing strategy that presented targeting difficulties for the enemy.  But after this point it starts to break down.  When you actually get into the arena, there's no interesting aspect to wins a fight.  It basically comes down to which AI derps the least, as there's no stat differences (that I could tell) between members of the same class. Every sniper is the same.  Every shotgunner is the same. Every machine gunner is the same.  Because of the way these classes work, they can only be played certain ways without a lot of wriggle room.  This is compounded by the fact that there are three actions a bot can do:  Shoot, move, and score (in collection mode).  There are powerups on the map which can present a small amount of strategic diversity, but every encounter between bots plays out the same way:  Fire, retreat when shield is low or empty, return to battle.  If you're really just interested in nuts and bolts AI vs AI and don't care about interesting battles and want to prepare your AI for all situations and program it to respond properly to everything it encounters you can get more strategic depth, but that's where the other critical problem comes in, and that is the debugging.  The debugging process is monotonous and extremely slow.  In most programming languages or even games, you can very quickly spot problems and correct them, but the problem with this game is that unless you've done extensive testing of your AI, you're going to see derpy things happen during your matches that you don't understand, and you have to rewind the game and go to a debug window to find out exactly why it's behaving in a way you didn't want.  Not only does this completely break up the gameplay experience to have to stop watching a match to do this, but finding out exactly where the problem is can be troublesome as you often have to completely pause the game and go step by step just to figure out which decision branch is failing.I have experience debugging programs and have been doing it for a long time so I can instantly understand when I have a sign flipped or am checking the wrong variable, but for anyone who isn't a computer scientist it's going to be even more tedious.  And that's where I'm at right now.  I will say that I got the $10 it cost me worth of playing time, and the developer did a diligent job and this is no knock on the devs.  I see where they have tried to solve the problems and didn't ignore them.  On those merits some might want to give it a chance just on those merits, but ultimately I need to rate a game on whether it's worth it for YOU to spend your hard earned money and at this point I can't say the game has a good enough system in place yet.What would change my mind?-More bot classes, customizable bot classes.-Bot abilities with cooldowns, items on the map that do more than increase health or shield (i.e. damage buffs, items that deal damage, etc...).-More AI options so you don't have to program workarounds for things that aren't there (where lots of bugs happen).    An example would be the ability to move toward or flee areas on the map like toward boundaries, toward the center, etc...-Maybe another mode or two.  A MOBA mode would actually be nice for this kind of game and might even work with the current setup."
280,2577,"Enjoy the thought and care that went into this game.  If you enjoy programming or want to learn the logic of programming using an easy to use interface this game is for you.  My first programming game was  Robot Odessy, then Mind Rover so I have a background in programming.   The cost is very reasonable for all that you get"
281,2577,"If you've ever wanted to make your roombas fight each other, you will like this game"
282,2577,"This game is a one of a kind. Programming bots to fight and winning fights with the AI you made is so satisfying. Its a battle of the smartest bots, your programming a bot to make decisions with out you directly controlling them in a fight and its not the easiest when you want to start teaching the bots to switch targets and switch tactics when the battle isn't going your way. I've never had any programming experience but the tutorial was easy to understand. If i can learn it then you can too, its a great brain exercise."
283,2577,"Really makes you appreciate how difficult it is to write good game AI.Highly recommended, multiplayer is endlessly addictive & fun."
284,2577,Uh a game which makes you think a lot :|
285,2577,"Interesting idea, but veery complicated. Too complicated."
286,2577,Where has this bin all my life?
287,2577,It reminds me of an old flash game I used to really love called Bot Arena. I love it.
288,2577,I love programming.
289,2577,"Not much programming background, but this game is great. Great UI and multiplayer setup. Looks like substantial amount of depth definitely going to put in a lot of hours."
290,2577,This is brilliant from the start.- Scratches the logic and planning itch with class- Multiplayer without needing the other player to be live- Quick to learn but the skill cap is.... is there one?- The mechanics are fun to discover and work with. The design of the game is such that even a simple new addition could offer way more than expected in possibilities to chew on. Elegant
291,2577,I'm not good at programming at allBut this game is super fun sofarNot that I'm good at itI give it a big 'ole thumbers uppers
292,2577,"!-! Accurate info about microtransaction from some one who actually played the game. !-!You do NOT have to pay credits to play the campaigns, The credit amount you see is your REWARD for beating that campaign level.You can spend those credits on skins for your bots.You also have the option to buy credits to get skins, but that's purely optional.There is nothing gameplay-wise you have to pay for.Also...OMG THIS IS SO MUCH FUN!"
293,2577,"This is a fun, creative, well polished and challenging game.Can't recommend this game highly enough."
294,2577,"Frist english Review for you ,good game ,nice game.very good game!!!"
295,2577,I have had this a while and have just had a quick play. It is very polished since the version  I had and will be looking to play more of it. It is well worth the purchase price and I will be more than happy to buy again on the IPAD mini. It is very reminiscent of the old OMEGA 2000 which I still own and played on  dos box.Dev: You did say when it is released as Version 1.00 the IOS was soon to follow...
296,2577,I was waiting for a game like this for a long time!P.S. there are NO microtransactions!.                                       $$$$$$                                                 
297,2577,so far so good
298,2576,"This game is good.  There's a bit of a learning curve and it can be a struggle to improve your AI at first, but when you keep at it, and a breakthrough comes, your bots perform massively, and you're able to make progress, it's so rewarding.The community is helpful, yet competitive.  If you enjoy robots playing games of capture-the-flag and king-of-the-hill while exploding each other, are into programming and artificial intelligence, and don't mind banging your head against an automated death machine because it's not doing what you expect, get this game."
299,2576,This game really sucks you in. It's honestly really addictive to constantly hone your bot's different AI's to see how you can improve their behavior.
300,2576,This is a fun game for those who want to improve their programming logic and see their creativity come to life through the bots that they programmed.Really unique game and it makes programming in this system fun.
301,2576,Great game! but its too 5Head for me
302,2576,if.... else.... simulator
303,2576,"Microtransactions/EditI should be fairer to the game.I did enjoy the gameplay idea. but seeing as there are ingame purchases i was disapointed and rushed my first review/statement. The Mobile game nature of the game didn't help the case. I don't fault the developer for trying to make money.I can honestly say that i enjoy games of this type. Puzzel and programming are two things i enjoy in games. Using Robots to fight and having to think about how they will behave and in what order is a really cool idea. the game itself has enough depth in it's mechanics to not become broing. I ultimately still cannot recomment the game, despite me enjoying it."
304,2576,Nice programing game that's not to complex.
305,2576,Very very good for learning the basics for AI
306,2575,Genius.
307,2575,"Great game for anyone that wants to toy around with AI.Made even better by allowing you to focus just on your AI, not worrying about leveling up, skills or builds. Its purity in that regard really stands out.I should note that I've played far more on my phone than the Steam version, I'm so happy that it is cross platform now."
308,2575,"This is the kind of game I have been looking for for quite some time. It's fun, challenging, educational, has a great community and good for killing a few minutes or digging in for an all nighter.Learning to use the interface was easy enough and the commands are fairly straightforward. Over time I began to realize that not everything worked the way I imagined, oh no, it was so much more in depth! After becoming involved in the community and I learned what people were teaching their bots to do... I was stunned! I thought I had a fair grasp and come to find out I was still swimming in the kiddie pool. There was so much more to learn and experiment with, and people are still finding new ways of doing things and openly debate their tactics. Im not ashamed to admit I've screenshot quite a few discussions....I found it via the Play Store for Android where 98% of the applications there prey on addictive behavior for the almighty advertising dollar. It's great to see there is still quality content like this out in the world. Honestly, this is one of the best games I have ever played."
309,2575,"This game is one of my favorites. Creating an AI to battle other AIs, great concept!Takes a lot of time to make a good AI, but if you got one, you can use a lot of hours beating others :DDefinitely buy this, worth the money for sure.Dev is also a cool guy, join the discord and you'll see"
310,2575,"Interesting and addictiveBest programming game for non-programmers at the moment.Would be fun to see a custom maps editor,so playercommunity can build mazes,obstaclecourses, timetrials, etc.To bring the game to the next level!"
311,2574,"The game is in early access but even so, it has proven to be a very deep, strategic game with lots of options. Even for someone like me who has never understood more about programming than game maker games (due to the drag and drop, similar to this), I can use it. What bothers me is the usage of the word AI when it has nothing to do with AI. You don't make your bots intelligent. They don't think for themselves. Just a bunch of if/thens. Which surely isn't as catchy, but I'd have liked if the game wasn't using false pretenses to get you into it. Aside from that (and also luckily not the reason why I got the game), the game is great already and has great potential as well. Adding more options to program with would drastically increase the depth each time, so the sky is the limit. A recommendation for anyone who likes thinking games"
312,2574,"About 10 years ago I got into parallax and arduino micro controllers. Made some silly little robots that would wander the house like gold fish and a couple mini sumo bots... Once I met my wife she wasn't too keen on the middle of the living room being a robot arena and the minimal furniture being dedicated to robot construction so I packed it all up. After my Facebook got hacked I don't even have any cool photos left. Been looking for a game like this for quite some time. I've spent thousands of dollars on robot parts and tools, at $14.99 you should play this game if you're interested into getting into robotics. Even if you're not interested in robotics, no coding knowledge required. It's a nice little game. R.I.P. letsmakerobots      https://hackaday.com/2015/09/25/lets-make-robots-changes-hands-kerfuffle-ensues/"
313,2573,"Captivating and addictiveIf you like this kind of stuff it's the best you can get at the momentWell, if you don't mind to lose a lot of your lifetime...   :D"
314,2573,"Wow, that's what I have to say. I played the game on Android, loved it so much that I decided to purchase it on Steam (the only game I have on Steam) to support the dev and encourage him to continue with adding more great contents :)"
315,2572,"I never knew how to program before this.  I never imagined I would or could.  This game has taught me how to program at a basic level and even shown me that I can program pretty complicated stuff despite no training...  That makes this a pretty good game.   And it's fun when you finally debug that one problem in your code, only to update something and have to do it again."
316,2572,"Game's great. Scratches that deep-seated itch at the crossroads of creativity and problem-solving. I love that once combat begins, you have to trust your machines. It's like Battlebots had a passionate night with FIRST League."
317,2569,"pro- easy to get into- powerful, easy to use commands to program your Bot-AI with- simplistic but addicting gameplay- so far I didn't encounter any bugscon- cosmetics are there but are either a drag to grind, or behind a paywall- tutorial only brushes the surface of available commands- soundtrack gets old real quick- price-tag a bit too high for what it brings content-wise---8/10If you turn the soundtrack off and play some synthwave in the background I'd give this little gem a 8/10 for what it is.It's not expensive in and of itself, but it's asking a bit much for what content usually can be expected from freeware, too.I think the developer deserves it, tho. Seems to be polished and frequently updatedFun little game I intent to sink some of my coffee-brakes into."
318,2568,Fun game so far.
319,2567,Developer personally contacted me to report that an annoyance in the interface had been corrected. I can now fully endorse this great game. Thanks GFX!
320,2567,"Very fun, and makes you feel smart when you get the hang of it"
321,2565,"Very fun game to play, if you are willing to spend some time learning the tricks behind it. Because even though the tutorial teaches you all the basics you need, it is for you to build upon them and create your personal strategy. It is especially interesting to follow the AI you created in a battle and see what decisions it makes and why, allowing you to improve it after every match played.Definitely a game for people who are interested in programming or with an analytic mind."
322,2564,"Very fun, once you taste the blood of noobs.Good for developing the skills to be a developer. A game for smart people."
323,2563,This game is excellent!
324,2563,"This game is amazing!however, if you (gfx74) can add some code support, it will be even more amazing. Something like:if(bla&&bla||bla){      bot1.flag(getEnemy(closest&&movingto(bot1)));      bot1.attack(getEnemy(1));      ....}else if(...){.........}Or even: loop(){      ....      if(...){break; }}You can give your players the choice to use the block programming or to use the hard code programming, so casual players and hardcore players can all enjoy it. (ps: just a wild suggestion lol)"
325,2562,"This is a pretty compelling game.I haven't played long enough to discover any exploits but the core concept is exactly as promised, using flow based logic AI. I picked this up because I'm interested in learning more about this.I particularly like how easy it is to play ranked games.Microtransactions seem a bit over-aggressive, but we're talking chaning the colour of some robots, certainly nothing that I feel heavily impacts the experience very much"
326,2562,"Very fun AI based logic game for those looking for a programming game without actual code.  It hurts my brain like when I play Shenzen IO (I am interested in coding but I am not a programmer).  The multiplayer ranked and un-ranked matches are what interest me the most and have me spending hours analyzing my AI and making changes here and there to improve my performance.  It's also a game I can spend a half hour on and walk away when I'm stumped, then come back the next day with a fresh idea.  I'm thinking about AI routines when I'm at work, what the hell is wrong with me?  Lol."
327,2562,"As a programmer, Gladiabots gives me similar feelings as Factorio (while being a very different genre)."
328,2562,"Wow, this is how you make a proper AI inspired game.Note, this is AI in the terms of Rule-based robotic engines, not in terms of artificial neural networks that train themselves.In this game, you are the optimizer.You have to find the rules, explore, exploit, iterate, optimize.Build up a library of survival tactics. Adapt. Conquer.Be careful not to overfit. Tip: Enable in the menu ""Right-click to escape"" so that you will navigate the interface faster, since you'll be doing a lot."
329,2562,"Pretty good in most accounts, except the matchmaking (misranked opponents due to the nature of asymmetric multiplayer). The real ""game"" is the intuitive and simple, yet powerful AI editor that allows for a wide range of strategies, the matches are just there to watch. Active and helpful community (discord)."
330,2561,"I've been looking for a game to help me learn coding. Having some action, strategy and a bunch of dakka is a huge bonus... and Gladiabots certainly delivers in spades! One major issue I have with other ""online"" games is that, well, I suck at them. Enter Gladibots. The gameplay aspect is purely cosmetic and/or diagnostic. By the time you're watching robots trade injuries, the battle has already been decided. The REAL game is before this, in the AI developer and Team builder. How are you going to build your team? Will you be aggressive and try to kill off the enemy team, then win resources? Or will you try to quickly capture everything? Or are you well versed in military tactics and set up a fire team with a base of fire, sniper support and a maneuver element to flank? The choices are as endless as your imagination!All that said, there ARE a couple of things to be aware of: There IS a learning curve. Even with the tutorial breaking things down to ""using crayons"", things can get complex with amazing speed. It will take a little bit of patience to make it over the initial bump to intuitive understanding before the world becomes your oyster. Think of it like Chess - It take a little bit of effort to remember how all the pieces move, but once you do you can really start to LEARN. It's the same thing here, once you learn the first few bits of the Gladiabots programming UI the pieces (literally) fall into place. Well, maybe not ""fall"" since you need to drag them, but the point still stands. Since people seem to love Pro/Con lists, I'll make one. Pros:- Fun- In active development- Well polished (despite being in development)- Thought /Skill based, not ""twitch"" based gameplay- Helps develop logical thinking patterns- FUN- Active, open and welcoming community on Discord- The Game Developer is very friendly and responsive- No violence against living things - robots in an arena only- There is no ""Right"" answer, there are infinite ones!Cons:- Can be intimidating to people completely unfamiliar with the genera- Expectations might be misplaced for people hoping to actually drive the robots in battle- The learning curve may be too steep for people unaware of learning/help resources (tutorial, youtube, forums, etc)In short, I can't recommend this game highly enough!"
331,2560,"Great Game Love the way you can program the bots, simple for the simple player to pick up thanks GREAT GAME!!!!"
332,2560,"The exact game concept behind Gladiabots occurred to me in the past, and I wondered if it'd be fun to play.It is."
333,2559,I remember playing this game in its alpha stages and IT WAS AWESOME! This game is worth every cent for someone looking to challenge their mind. This game is really fun and gives you a little insight into programming by simplyfing it.
334,2559,"I wanted to recommend this but I got bored of it on the 2nd campaign. I normally love logic & strategy games, but it's not as appealing for me as I thought it would be, nor is there anywhere near the amount of creative freedom available in team configuration. I think the AI editor, game-menus, and general menu-navigation needs improvement, as well as to look less bland. There is not much really making me want to go back into the AI editor right now to fix my team after losing. The game also lacks the depth that usually makes me want to commit more time to it. Maybe it's just that every level looks nearly identical to the last one and they all look like some tron-esque virtual atmosphere which I tend to get bored of quickly. I certainly appreciate this kind of game and the work going in and will check back again."
335,2559,"Great game! If you're new to programming, this game is great for you. You can see your AI work as the matches progress and are able to edit very easily. The tutorial is very helpful and lets you get a good grasp of everything."
336,2558,amzing
337,2558,This game is the definition of easy to learn and hard to master. You can make a decent bot in 5 min. But improving your bot almost never ends.
338,2558,best of the best game ever !!!
339,2556,"Disclaimer:At the time of writing there are just 12 hours on my steam record, but don't let that fool you. I've played countless hours on the mobile version.In summary+ If you like to puzzle, develop strategies, code or perfecting your work, you will probably like this game. It doesn't have the live action a FPS offers, but it is great fun watching your creations fight other players, perfecting them along the way. Everything is made by a single dev, that works hard on updating the game and only charges money for costmetics that can be unlocked through playing the game as well. - The biggest con i can think of is that you need to learn it's not always bad to lose, it sucks if your elo rank drops down or if you can't beat a singleplayer chapter. Which will probably happen to everyone at least once.If you're still skeptical: Try it on mobile!(""Do you guys not have phones!?"")No, seriously. This game can be amazing and has good support(it even has a wiki) so try it out for free if any of this sounds interesting, and if you don't like it just leave it at that. You can even play the game on mobile only, as I have done for a long period of time. And if you like it and want to play the game on PC to look at your AI you created in 4k60(or are just more comfortable with your mouse),buy the game on steam to support the developer so he can improve the game even more.The Review Accesability It might look daunting to see the complex AI's built by the community. But i believe everyone who likes strategy or puzzle games can like this game. After 30 minutes you probably understand the entire game system, but you can choose to make an AI as big as you want:You can choose to go through the singleplayer chapters and try to make an new algorithm for each specific level to beat it, as if it were a puzzle. Or you can go hardcore and try to make an algorithm that can beat all chapters. Dont like singleplayer? Go for the ranked matches that give some more of a challenge.  And don't be afraid you aren't nerdy or try-harding enough to beat people, you get matched to players at your level. Or just play casual unranked. gameplay There isn't any coding experience required, you can use the simple blocks system that's made for this game wich is pretty intuitive.  I personally love perfecting my giant AI's and adding all kinds of special strategies depending on the situation, but it's also fun to keep it small and efficient as possible. For me the most fun in the game is definetely to play ranked and analyzing why i lost to make sure that doesn't happen again. And it feels really great if that strategy you just added makes your bots outsmart the other team and turn the tides the next match. I have been following this game for a long time and watched it grow, and grown it has, in my opinion only for the better. So don't get put off by the ""Indie"" and ""Early acces"" tags as it is being heavily updated by the creator. AFAIK there is currently even being worked on multiple new game modes. The game has a great community and that's what it's built for. It's not a cash grab or anything, and definetely not pay to win, which brings me to my last point: The only currency in this game can be unlocked by playing the singleplayer chapters and leveling up, as well a getting a league promotion in ranked, there are no ""Diamonds"" or anything that's microtransaction only. That currency can then be used to buy the cosmetics as seen in the the screenshots in the store, no premium weapons that make your bots better. The only thing that determines your perfomance are the strategies you came up with. Of course these credits can be bought, which is just a way for the creator(yes, just one dev) to earn his bread."
340,2556,"AI complexity is very trivial and, to the contrary of what the description lets your believe, it doesn't give a lot of options to control the bots."
341,2556,Really fun game
342,2554,Really enjoy this game. its one of those thatll have you thinking about it while your working and writing ideas down for when you get chance to pick up you phone or sit on your computer. Love the fact its mobile accesible too. its also helped me with how to program my AI for my games. so thank you for the awesome game. Would recommend to everyone.
343,2552,Unique
344,2551,Fun Game for everyone who likes games of logic. Even with simple tools you have the opportunity to build complex bot behaviours. A lot of fun for me.
345,2551,"Frustatingly fun! Take your time, experiment and don't be afraid to fail (a couple of hundred times), you'll get it eventually!"
346,2551,It's fun and annoying at the same time. I'm impresssed.
347,2551,"Train yours bots and your mind, this game should be in all schools."
348,2551,Develops brains!
349,2550,"Discovered this game during its Early Access.Simply put, I'm a big fan!Can't say, if you can create Skynet with it, but as an introduction to AI programming for my children, it's perfect!"
350,2550,Carnage Hearts on PSP but better and prettier and on PC. DO IT!
351,2549,intelligent
352,2549,.
353,2549,its fun game
354,2549,"My goal for any indie game I pick up is to get about a dollar an hour of entertainment. I'll be hitting that mark this morning and am pretty stoked to be diving in again. I played a game called Carnage Heart as a kid, it sold me on behavior tree games like this. There is a good amount of controll for your bots but not an overwhelming amount. The game happily teaches you how to build a basic AI and provides a training ground called the Campaign.Each time I do minor tweaks to my bots I take them back through the highest chapter I've completed in the Campaign to make work out bugs before getting back on the ladder. After I level off on the ladder, I go back to the Campaign and try to push higher using new things I learned from multiplayer.I can easily see this game getting over a hundred hours from me in the first month. I'm a huge fan of this genre, but I think this game will take the number one place for recommending friends try the genre out. The behavior tree lets programmers and non-programmers alike compete which is a grand achievement and GFX47 should be very proud."
355,2548,"The goal is simple. Assemble a squad of bots, battle other squads while competing for resources. Well, there is another part to it. Your bots have to make decisions on the battlefield using the AI instructions you programmed them with. You cannot intervene during battles. You might be put off by a steep learning curve, but fear not. There are very useful tutorials that will hold your hand until you have all you need to start programming. The programming is very user friendly and makes use of neat visual flow charts instead of text code. Debugging is made easy with the ability to spectate any of your bots and see the path selection they take in real time. You can also test your AI in a sandbox mode. Once you have the basics down you have a wide variety of conditions and actions to choose from to program an efficient fighting force. How complex you want to go is really up to you.I would recommend you start with the campaign, but once you have a good basic understanding of the game, multiplayer is where all the fun is at. Multiplayer puts you in an asymmetric online battle against other player programmed AI. The ranking system will match you up against players of the same skill level during which you will face a wide variety of different team assemblies and strategies Tweak and improve on your own team to progress through the ranks. Overall the game is very well put together, very unique, and a ton of fun."
356,2548,Great game
357,2547,"I have been really enjoying this game, the best part is its connected to my phone so I can play anywhere. if you ever played Frozen Synapse I think you will like this game 2."
358,2547,Good  for learning AI programming. Kids should play Gladiabots or similiar Zactronics games instead of FPS Zombie shooting.
359,2546,"This game is AMAZING!!! I'm complete garbage at coding in real life, but with a simple understanding of conditional statements I'm really having fun! This game is very well built. The interface is simple and straight forward. Very intuitive layout and easy to navigate. Extremely addictive game play! I've been recommending this to all my friends that are even remotely interested in programing. Even those that aren't still get a recomendation for this game. SO MUCH FUN!!"
360,2546,"Been playing since the alpha, really nice game even if you're not a programmer. Also the dev is in contact with the community like no other."
361,2546,"Wow, just the game I was looking for.  Reminds me of a game I played as a kid on C64: Omega.  So I also love this game for nostolga reasons as well.It's already great.  I can't wait for even more features and improvements."
362,2546,"Unfortunately I can no longer recommend this game and I have changed my review from YES to NO.The developer of this game has decided that Mobile players are more important, and is going to restrict AI complexity in an extreme way in order to make it a better mobile experience.These restrictions will be applied to the PC version in all areas (including sandbox where your just practicing locally on your PC).Instead of allowing you to be creative this change will mean you will extremely limit creativeness and alternate methods of achieving goals.  Completely ruins the entire idea of the game.  Such a shameIn Response to the Developer :  A far FAR better solution would have been to add a 'limited' mode which you can switch to which applies these restrictions and has its own ranked MP, allowing anyone to choose how they want to go, big (but slow) or small (but limited).   You certainly could have left the sandbox open to any type of AI, its not even against othersOLD REVIEWAbsolutely fantastic game if you like the idea of programming ai but don't want to have to actually program the ai :PThe AI editor with its clockwise mechanic makes for interesting solutions and problems to solve that will test your brain powerOverall if you think you'd like spending hours tweaking and improving an (at one stage simple) AI for battle robots and pitting them against bots made by people from all over the world in epic battles, buy this game."
363,2545,fANtASTing
364,2545,"Neat game. UI could uses some help, some of the menu icons and various tooltips are confusing/ wrong. But over all its simple game to understand quickly and a deep game once you really get into it. (I have not yet)"
365,2544,"Cool concept for a game!Programming your bots to do battle with the opposing team is addictive as heck so far!I have not played this game more than 3 hours, so bear with me, I'm not a gladiabot expert, but so far that hasn't stopped me from enjoying the rather simple psuedo programming,but don't think that means the game is too shallow in the gameplay department, in fact i feel overwhelmedby the sheer amount of stuff you can do in the game, so many possibilities!if your not into programming style gameplay, this game isn't really your cup of tea, you don't actually CONTROL your bots firsthand, so it requires a certain taste from the player. Good game"
366,2544,fake code is hard to make.
367,2543,"Gladiabots gives you a little more than just entertainment.You have to actually think, solve problems and a high learning curve.I think this is the first game that I replay it's tutorial over and over just to get things right!Thumbs up!... Now, excuse me, I can't keep writing a review...I have to go through the tutorial again ;)"
368,2542,"This game is an incredible idea, its also very easy to get into and very tricky just against the computer! If you like the sound of it get it! This guy needs more money!"
369,2542,Game has a ton of potential.  Ranked matches super smooth and easy.Now to figure out how to make these darn things fight!
370,2542,"Great game, smart and polished, with a very user-friendly interface. Design your own AI routines and send your team of bots to the fight."
371,2542,"This game is awesome!I played Leekwars and Screeps and loved those games but as I'm not a programer, I struggled very often. This game is easier to get into and you should definately give it a try!EDIT2: The following seems to have been fixed by the dev and is no longer relevant:I have to skip two popups everytime I launch the game. The first one pushes me to write a review, the second one asks me to buy the optimization package.EDIT: Writing a review doesn't get rid of the popup asking to review the game!"
372,2542,it is a good game. If you like programming then def buy this. If you like to fiddle with stuff buy this. If you dont like puzzles or things that require planning then dont buy this.
373,2542,I really like that you can constantly expand and polish your AI! The frequent updates are helping to implement more advanced behaviors and are expanding the game in every direction! Even the singleplayer campaign ranges from very easy to extremly hard! The developer responds quickly on discord or per e-mail when you report a bug or have a suggestion. I hope that more people will pick this game up!
374,2542,At about 2 hours in I got addicted
375,2542,this game is truely fun and a real challange. gives a respect to game AI programers
376,2541,"Highly recommend to everyone, regardless of programming experience.For people new to programming, Gladiabots has a graphical drag-and-drop interface that's very easy to learn and plenty of people at your skill level.For code freaks who see the world as green symbols scrolling past, prepare to get humbed as your creations are crushed by the reigning GrandMasters. Or perhaps you could earn your place among them."
377,2541,A really nice game. User friendly and addicting.
378,2541,"Yes yes yes, if you love coding this is a game for you."
379,2541,"A whole new kind of great game !It's so awesome to fight new AI one after another, learn from your weaknesses, change your algorythm, and win, and see where you started from, with only basic instructions to your bot to a higly detailed and complexed algorythm who will wreck most of your opponents. Very good one !As well, the Career mode (multiplayer) is cool and you might fast become one of the best rated player in the world, considering there are hundreds of players worldwide.It is not the kind of game you are going to get mad at, because everything is automatized. So if your robots fail, it's because your code lines are weaker than your opponents'. No lag, no early or late click, only your mind and imagination and tactical skills againts those of your opponent.There's a bug : when trying to rename a AI, if you click on delete to erase the name you are going to modify, a pop up ask you if you wish to delete the AI."
380,2541,"is cool, but not for everyone"
381,2541,Just Amazing.
382,2541,"After some time I must update my review.The game seems fantastic at first, I have been long waiting for a game like this.AI bot matches, solo or in teams, multiplayer, sandbox...Just it would be nice if there were more hints, information and statistics to tune your bots.Also currently programming the AI is terrible micromanagement. It would be nice to set the preferred behaviour on some more coarse grained level... :)Programming a coordinated team behaviour is too much pain for me given the current possibilities.Well executed idea. Fun, entertaining, educating.First of it's own genre...8/10"
383,2541,"I love that I can get my fill of coding an AI even when I switch to the Android version. Well put together, great cross-platform support.Gameplaywise, writing AIs to be used across 4 bots and 4 different classes to cover a robust set of scenarios? The options are endless. I have done Halite I and II, Ants, and Planet Wars and this feels like a nice way to get that same idea year-round."
384,2541,This is one of those games that seems very simple but when you get into it you can lose hours. I thought it looked interesting but when I started playing I got hooked. It isn't difficult to command your robots the fun comes in trying to get them to outperform the opposition no mater how they come at you.
385,2540,"This is a very fun game if you are into competitive programming games. The tutorial does a very nice job of getting you started. The single player campaign is very challenging and should be able to help you create an advanced enough ai to make descent progress in the multiplayer games. So far I have found many limitations to what you can do with the programming in this game, but the creative ways to get around them is what makes the game even more interesting."
386,2540,really fun game. great interface. interesting AI building.
387,2540,"I love this kind of game, even though it can be very frustrating when you can't understand why something doesn't work like you planned it to. But then, suddenly, you see it, fix it, and feel so rewarded when the AI works like it should.I like games where I can play with a cup of coffee in one hand, and take all the time I need to think and plan. No buttons to mash. No constant being on guard in case an enemy pops up in front of you trying to kill you.If you like to relax, to think, to program (no requirement really), using logic, taking all the time you want to plan ahead....Then the game might be for you!"
388,2540,I'm using LucidChart at work to plan the AI architecture of my killer robot army.I hope I don't end up having to explain this to HR.
389,2540,I like this. Its something different. Very nicely presented with good user-friendly tutorials.
390,2539,Very nice!
391,2539,"+1Expect programming puzzles and optimization first, tactics and strategy second."
392,2538,A fantastic game if you are a seasoned programmer or never so much as seen a computer before!
393,2538,Make a lot of fun - is intensiv - and need a lot of brain :)Thanks for this cool game !
394,2538,"This is my first foray into programming-style games, and I think I made a good choice. The interface is simple to get into, yet has a complexity that you need to practice to unlock. You don't so much power up a character or team in this game as much as you ""power up"" yourself by getting better at the logic behind controlling your team. PROS:+ Polished feel overall+ Easy to learn gameplay core+ Asynchronous Multiplayer fits this game nicelyCONS:- Odd camera controls, with no way to customize them (hotkeys are all over the keyboard, no WASD camera movement)- Campaign difficulty curve seems to spike dramatically"
395,2538,"There is a real sense of progression that belies belief. You have access to every tool from the start, so is it not true, that the only thing that ""progresses"" is what you have learned?Yes. That skill is tangible. You hold it in the shape of a library eldritchly complex and beautiful.That library is a list of the behaviors you have written, it is made by you, it grows by you, and it feasts upon your effort. Every new instance on its list is another ruthlessly efficient machination of war refined only by you. Every last entry is a beautiful death trap, more and more seamless and efficient with every passing battle. And you will watch it all unfold.You will be given a rock. You will be given a direction. Watch yourself throw it with the accuracy of a nuke."
396,2538,"Realy fun ""but hard"", i like it"
397,2538,awesome game!
398,2538,Excellent game.  Totally addictive.
399,2538,"Great!This isn't just about programming AIs. It is a game, and a fantastic one at that.To those of you on the fence thinking ""Programming? That just sounds like work."", I can tell you that this feels like a competitive game, and that the challenge to overcome isn't the act of programming an AI by itself, but rather about defeating the meta and outsmarting your opponents on the ladder. - Before the game has even started!An extremely well polished and fun early access title.00001010 / 00001010"
400,2537,Solid design concept and solid execution.
401,2537,"It was about 1:10 and I was preparing to go to bed when I browsed the ""what games do you currently play?""-thread on civforum.de. Someone mentioned Gladiabots and briefly described what it is.I knew immediately that this kind of game would be my thing. I saw it had decent reviews and instapurchased it without further research.It is 4:13 now. After doing the tutorials I got to Chapter 2 Mission 6 in singleplayer and won 3 online-matches before I lost the first one by just tweaking the default-AI a bit for an all-assault-team. Now I need to tweak my AI and make it more in-depth. But I have to sleep and work first. Damn it!I really fell in love with this game. It is more or less exactly what I've always wanted to play but I just didn't know it existed. I expect those 3 hours I have in the game right now to ramp up massively in the future."
402,2537,"Gladiabots is an extremely compelling and superb optimization puzzle. Each increasingly difficult fight against opponents tests whether the logic you gave your team of autonomous robots is good enough to win the current fight or whether it needs to be optimized. This game can be feel very similar to Rocket League, only that you win by outsmarting your opponents, instead of having to rely on fast reaction times.What an amazingly well executed idea! This is strategy at its finest. Endless possibilities of improving your robots AI. This game focuses almost entirely one a single idea, but executes it supremely well:The continous development of logic for your team of robots.Incredibly well done and polished for an indie game developed only by a single person. Despite its current early access status, I have not encountered a single crash or bug and it is really well-developed already. Still, the single game developer listens to community feedback and continues to implement new suggestions. A stellar and very polished indie logic puzzle game. Highly recommended!"
403,2537,Fantastic game concept. Incredibly fun and intuitive.
404,2537,Very fun. Scales to provide a chalenge. Great dev interaction. Experienced no bugs. Game in 'finished' enough to validate price point.
405,2537,"Bought this game two days ago.Really enjoying it so far, really good UI and, as others have said, starts off simple but gets harder as you progress and learn more about the AI and how it works. Obviously, the game is Early Access so there will be bugs to iron out, new things to add/change etc but on what I've seen so far, this is an Early Access game that is worth getting."
406,2537,Excellent game! The mechanics are super thoughtful and rewarding. Go go bots!
407,2537,"Hours of stairing at decision trees and boxes thinking you're a god of logic, only to see your robots destroyed and immediately realizing you must be the dumbest person on Steam.11/10, self-esteem is overrated"
408,2537,Awesome.  Runs sweetly on Linux. We are gonna need more lower-half-of-the-room cleaning robots in the arena!
409,2537,Great Game.
410,2537,Learn to code while having fun.
411,2537,"Constantly asked to enter an email. Nopy nope nope. If I am forced to use fake emails, I cannot recommend a game. May change the recommendation if this is changed."
412,2536,"Very nice game. 4 bots, 4 classes, zero free will, bots do only what you programm them to. During battle you can fastforward, slowdown, rewind and see your progam's inner workings every step, so it's easy to debug. Also battles have no randomness to them, if you didn't change AI, battle's going to be the same, so you can watch same battle several times to see what exactly went wrong. So tools for AI building are nice.The game is aimed at multiplayer. There's a solo campain, but it's basically multiplayer vs predefined bots of increasing difficulty. The way multiplayer works is you battle other player's AIs and get rating points for winning, lose them for losing. Since all you need to battle is two AIs, your opponent doesn't actually have to be online, so there's no problem of waiting for opponent ever. Unfortunately because it's multiplayer, the game is really hard: as your program becomes better, improving it becomes increasingly complicated, and there're always players smarted than you with even more complex AIs."
413,2536,having more fun then seems reasonable
414,2536,"There once was a game called Mindrover. It was made by a now defunct company called Cognitoy. Mindrover when released in 2000 quickly gathered a cult following. Multiple websites were setup and people would send in their encrypted bot code and the site owners would run the code and post the leaderboards. I would stay up nights obsessed with perfecting my bots and perfecting their movements and tracking. Eventually like all other games, Mindrover was left behind for some other newer fancier game and the small community around it faded into nothing. Cognitoy the company that made Mindrover no longer exists.Over the past two decades, multiple bot programming games have come out and I have played them all. All of them have had some flaw to them. Most of them came down to not doing the programming aspect of the game right. The most popular ones would just have you learn Java. All of them have been poorly executed in my mind. Just not fun to play.I have tried to find a similar bot programming game that lived up to the gameplay, quality, and additctiveness of Mindrover. I am glad to see that it has finally found a worthy successor."
415,2536,"ehhh...it feels like a step back from alpha...nothing new feels... good to say the least, and i honestly feel like most of the additions are done poorly."
416,2536,Super unique game.
417,2536,"Gladiabots is a programming game that does not require any prior programming experience. You program robot AIs by building graphs of conditions and actions.It's pretty deep strategically, but you can have fun just building a tiny AI and seeing how well or how poorly it does. You can play a single player campaign, ranked or unranked multiplayer, and experiment in sandbox mode.I think I've now spent more time on this game than any other, after playing for 'only' a year. It's really tremendous fun, even in periods where I was able to spend less time on it. It continues to evolve, the developer is very responsive to the community, and has continued to make the game better and better. It entered Early Access fully playable, though I do expect some things to change before final release.It's not that hard to get going, but if you do get stuck early on, be sure to visit the Discord server, accessible from within the game (under Extras), where a lot of very helpful folk hang out, who will be able to answer all your questions. The community so far has been very friendly, respectful, and welcoming to new players."
418,2536,"YOU CAN'T PLAY THE GAME UNLESS YOU HAVE AN ACCOUNT, PART OF THAT ACCOUNT IS TO GIVE THEM YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS THERE IS NO WAY TO OPT OUT OF IT EVEN IF YOU WANT TO PLAY ALONE. IN MY OPINION IT IS FISHY AN STEAM COULD DO WELL TO STOP SELLING ITDev has changed the email situation and the game is now well worth the money, Its all i was hoping for and would recommend it to all who like this type of programming game that dose not require code"
419,2536,"Absolutely fantastic game. The AI programming interface is very beginner-friendly, and optimizing AIs for different strategies is extremely fun.The game developer is heavily engaged with the community, and was helpful when I encountered a bug.Absolutely worth buying on Early Access, and I can't wait to see the finished version."
420,2536,"This is one of those games that if you're going to be into it, you'll know from a summary of what it is.So... you're programming the AI for a team of robots to take on another team of robots. There's no command line stuff (that's not the point with this one), you use a visual flow chart style AI decision tree with the equivalent of 'if' statements and 'action' statements. It's asynchronous multiplayer (praise be!), so you'll be matched up to other players' ghosts of a similar level. There is a league system, and it tracks your elo too. You can fast forward your matches, you can rewind, watch replays etc. The AI programming bit is about as painless as it can be.The tutorial is really good and there is a campaign you can play through too, though I've not done much of that.It also works on your phone (and you can sync it), though unless you've got a phablet it might be a bit tricky to really get into the nitty gritty of a big AI, I much prefer playing it on the laptop.So if this sounds like your kind of thing, then it probably is - the implementation of the ideas is really good and the Trello board promises more cool stuff too."
421,2536,Good game
422,2536,"Brilliant, fascinating game. You'll likely know if this is your sort of game from the store page description. If you think it could be, then I urge giving it a try. It's a great concept, superbly executed. The main gameplay loop is essentially sending your robots to fight, watching the battle and juding their behaviour, then iteratively improving or extending your AI graphs afterwards. You can play either against pregenerated AI opponents or in a ranked muliplayer league, both of which are challenging.The animations and sounds in the arena are excellent, so it looks great. The AI editor is easy to use and free of clutter. There's a couple of UI , but they're forgivable. I develop algorithms in my day job, so that fact I want to play this when I get home speaks to the game's quality.Buy this game!!!"
423,2536,"It's not often that I'll say this about a game, but this is amazing. The interface for configuring the robots' AI is simple and easy to use, but with it you can produce seemingly endless combinations of AI logic. You don't need to be a programmer, you just need to have a logical mind and a passion for tinkering. Robots, guns, artificial intelligence, and endless tinkering. I think I'm in heaven. The game has plenty of solo (i.e. PvE) missions to practice on (and for playing offline), but I think the real substance is the PvP. I've only been playing for a day or two, but so far I've not encountered any bugs, and the matchmaking has been really quick."
424,2536,Great game!  I'll be playing this for many hours for sure!  My son has been trash talking me since he started playing it on his phone a couple weeks ago.  He's already in Chapter 3!  Challenge accepted!  Time to cruush him!  Video of my first go at playing it.  It didn't exactly go the way I expected.  lol!https://youtu.be/PkuERD9TPp0
425,2536,
426,2536,"(Early Acess) Do you enjoy the challenge of coding and optimzing? Also do you watch competions like RoboMaster or Robot Wars? Then this might be a game for you. But for <$15, it's quite a deal in my opinion, even if you don't. I bought this today - and played it for 9 hours. . .Essientially, you get four robots to control; only preemptively. You have to block code and develop a winning stratedy (or AI of sorts) to gather resources, destroy enemies, or both at the same time, or something else entirely. The really cool thing about this game is the late game; MP and leaderboards. You create a team, enter tournies, and they automatically play other submitted team to find out the best ""AI."""
427,2536,"I can't change the color and skin of my bots because I don't have 11,000 points. It looks like I have either spend MORE MONEY, or complete 110 campaign missions (at +100 points each) just to change the color and skin of ONE BOT on my team. This is a disgusting trend in the gaming development community. Have my downvote Gladiabots."
428,2536,"If you enjoy battle robots, AI scripting, and the challenge of formal logic puzzles - no hesitation needed. Buy away!"
429,2536,Beep beep fixed a bug.Beep beep fixed a bug.Beep beep too lazy to fix the bug so I just scrap the idea entirely.Fun game! ^w^
430,2536,I played this game a long time ago when it was on android. It has come a long way!! Good fun wether you have 5 minutes or an hour. Gets your mind thinking.
431,2536,"I like Gladiabots a lot.It is strategic, and logical (because of the programming part).Also the features are realistic, such as live feed from a running program.It is also appealing for users who want to learn programming in a playful way.In my opinion, this is a great game."
432,2536,Singleplayer doesn't have enough content to hold interest for more than a few hours.In multiplayer every match devolves into shotgun collecting resources while the rest is bogged down in a standoff.
433,2536,"This is a very unique and wonderfull game for tacticians! It's about robot battles between teams of 4 robots each. The important part: During the actual battle, you cannot give orders to your robots. Instead, you need to equip each of them with an AI (orders which are bound to conditions), which alone will direct your robots' actions during battle. So the game is very much about anticipation (thinking, predicting) rather than reaction. You need to watch your replays closely to evaluate your team's weaknesses and then change your AIs accordingly. You'll find yourself in a feedback loop. And as the core gamemode pitches your team against the teams of other human players, there's always something to learn and improve (you cannot see your opponent's AIs, only the behaviour of their bots).  My impression is that Gladiabots has a very decent tactical depth as it offers plenty tactical intricacies that you need to consider if you want to become a famous robot-boach. For example, all (of the 4) robot-types come with a regenerating shield. Therefore, spreading out your opponent's damage and limiting your robots' time under fire is paramount. This usually requires your team to have good cohesion. You need to keep your bots in a formation, so that a bot whose shield is down can retreat behind his allies and regenerate. Also, target selection plays a major role, especially for bot-types who need a lot of time to zero-in on their target (sniper, machine gun). Moreover, you can't just concentrate on destroying all enemy robots - you also need to keep in mind that the game is decided by the score (you need to pick up little tokens and deliver them to your ""goals""). And these are just a few factors I learned about in my first two days of playing the game. Even though there is a large number of components that you can use to build your AIs, most of them are quite intuitive and easy to understand. Despite having only very little hobby-experience in programing, I had no troubles to understand how the AIs work and are evaluated during battle. And as the battles themselves are very transparent (you can always check which part of a robot's AI is active/getting processed at the moment), can be paused and rewind, the game is very well suited for slow, pondering armchair generals like myself.  Even if you're not into the robots theme: If you like tactical thinking and have fun designing creative strategies and battle-plans, you should try this game! In many ways, it reminds me of a sports game! Also, battles are quite short and fresh (5 minutes if you watch at normal speed), so be warned, you will be asking for ""Just one more round"" quite a lot!"

438,2536,A great game with an even better dev.
439,2536,I dont think other games will get my share of free time now :\Dancing shotgun is annoying as hell to face.This is how Skynet begins.
440,2536,"Clever combat puzzle game, done with love by a single dev. :)"
441,2536,"I've only been playing Gladiabots for a day. BUT I can already tell a few things about this game that I know will make it last, and make it into a really popular game for strategists. (1) The room for creativity when creating the AIs are pretty good, and it still seems to have a lot of room to expand if the game devs want it to. (2) The only thing limiting you at this point from unlocking custom colors and skins is the amount you play, meaning that there isn't any pay-to-win in this game. The only thing that effects the outcome of the game, (and thus your rank and level) is your own intellect. (3) At this stage in development there seem to be very few (if any) bugs. I only had one instance of something like a bug, and when I reported it to the game dev(s), I got a reply back within a few hours, from somebody who was very eager and willing to help. In conclusion, I think that this is a very well-made game that everybody should try, and there is room for expansion as well. I'm very pleased with what I got for $13.49."
442,2536,Good.
443,2536,"I absolutely love this game! The dev has done a great job of making something that's actually interesting to play!I've been part of the beta test for a couple of years now, along with a lot of other people who really love to play it.I've never played a game for 2 years straight on a mobile device, or any device really.   It's the only game I have on my phone, and one of the few I actually play on my PC.There's really nothing else like it.   There's an unlimited amount of playability in this game if you are willing to put in the effort.    You can build a simple AI and do well in the lower-middle leagues, or you can really go for it and create a big and complex AI and compete in the top league where the competition and innovation through the roof.Developers or wannabee developers will also love this game."
444,2536,"Gladiabots is an excellent game, perfect for anyone who wants to learn or play with programming notions.The Early Access version is already more polished and complete than most released game (so were the versions I played before the Steam release), and it's clear that the dev is putting a lot of love and effort in his work."
445,2536,What a great game. I just bought it and can't stop playing. Just the single player part is a blast. Do yourself a favor and try this one out.
446,2536,Good game. Can't wait to see what is added
447,2536,"please be careful with this product.. Side effects may include insomnia, obsessive optimization and chronic ""pew pew"" sounds from the mouth."
448,2536,"Played through all the tutorials, which do a great job of explaining enough basic strategies to prevent frustration in the main game. Also, use of player AIs for solo content is an interesting choice - I can't wait to see how that affects gameplay"
449,2536,"Great game for anyone who likes tinkering, programming, and optimization! Simple, straightforward, but fully-featured, with a well-thought-out multiplayer system."
450,2536,"Pretty fun game! The bot programming is super intuitive, and the online functionality is definitely mature for an early access game. I'll be playing this one for a while!"
451,2536,If you are a fan of games like Frozen Synapse definitely try this. You feel so clever and then the other team does something different and suddenly you get crushed. Would recommend.
452,2536,"Played on phone originally sod ecided to buy on pc too, good fun making programs and seeing them in action against other players bots"
453,2536,"yes, I like such games (puzzle + ai games) it has a good amount of ""puzzle parts"" :) continue to work on it!"
454,2536,this game is very fun and definitely worth 15 dollars. its good
455,2536,Strategy and logic and psuedo-programming. Love this game so far and looking forward to its future developments.
456,2536,"Just bought the Early Release PC version off Steam, and have been enjoying this game all day :)+ Robot Sandbox+ Arena Proving Grounds+ Intro to concepts like IF/THEN/ELSE, and WHILE loops+ Awesome use of Unity graphics engine+ Excellent mood music+ Developer (Sbastien) is responsive and eager to improve this initial offering+ Potentially *wide* horizons -- and this is the Best Part: With skin and A/D/M changes, this could be a Termite or Ant simulator, or could even be a Jurassic sim.  The root Kernal is key, and Sbastien has created a potential gold mine of gaming and instructional possibilities here.- Early Release means a few minor kinks to work out- Developer (Sbastien) is one man, needs more support to realize full potential of this great game"
457,2536,"Lost all my AIs somehow, now all I have is the ""Training AI""Edit: the experience above was annoying but after playing some more I guess it didn't matter much since the AIs probably wouldn't have worked anyway, ha! Just be careful I guess before you start tinkering with AIs if you haven't clicked on the campaign or sandbox mode yet."
458,2536,"Gladiabots is an amazing strategy game. If you don't know how to program, don't be scared, the game has a good tutorial to teach you the basics. From this, you'll learn how to create more advanced AI with an intuitive system.This is the kind of game that will make you feel smart, even more after a lot of hours!"
459,2536,"It really does scratch a unique itch. And it scratches it in a way that will make you smile. Get it, and get it fast!"
460,2536,"Loving it. If you love programming, this is the game for you, if you don't, this is still the game for you."
461,2536,"It is a good game, but I experienced a bug that kind of ruined it for me, if you go into any of the training missions, it overwrites any custom AI you made with the training AI. Will come back when its out of early access"
