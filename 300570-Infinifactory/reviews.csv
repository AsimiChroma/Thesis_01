And for their first 3D Programming game they did a good enough job with it. Let's skip to the problem: The main difficulty you will encounter is path length. There is no way to construct some sort of ""if then else"" function aside from a button that is triggered by objects passing by. But this thing is not enough for most solutions as you would normally want to do stuff like: while this space is occupied do this. But you can only trigger it while its passing in motion or else the lever that pushes your cubes around will be stuck. So really all you can do to synchronize your solution is to make the paths differently long and this is where it gets fiddly. I personally are currently stuck on a puzzle that has 1 cube generator and 1 shredder that makes them into different shapes. The result needs to be 6 cubes in triangle shape and 4 cubes normal. You see whats gonna happen right? Even if I make a solution that works for the first 1 or 2 iterations since I have to devide them un evenly and I can't tell the source to stop spawning the solution will desync eventually and that is exactly what happened. All I can do then is make the path 1 longer or shorter until it works for 10 entire iterations and this is a really tedious process. Opus Magnum didn't have a way for If selection either but the pathing in that game was way better since you had infinite space to build your machine. Infinifactory (ironically) doesn't have infinite space. Infact the topology of the level is often a problem in itself. Still recommend it since playing is still fun and the story is interesting. But the actual puzzles are really aweful to get to run properly later on."

I want to put my answer somewhere in-between.If you enjoy slamming your head into the wall until you find a solution, this game is for you.For about 50 hours (as shown by my time played), I did enjoy that. The earlier levels are pretty trivial, though it's fun trying to optimize solutions. As the levels got more difficult, I had fun trying to find a way past the limitations.On the final few levels, however, that effort became a chore. I felt as if the developers were _artificially_ increasing the difficulty by giving dumb, unnecessary constraints, like only providing a painter one block high when two blocks would have made the solution simple. By the in-game story, such a constraint makes literally no sense.The last straw was on the very last level of the game, where I spent several hours coming up with a solution that would finally get all the pieces in the right place to build this massive object, only to find out that two blocks which I _couldn't even see_ at the target location were missing, thus negating my entire solution. I would have had to start at least half of it from scratch, possibly all of it, due to the space limitations of the level.Part of this may be the inherent drawbacks of a 3D puzzle game like this. I don't know for sure. All I know is that I got to the final level, and I feel cheated enough by the devs that I'm not going to put in the extra few hours to fix my solution and finish the last level. I'm done."

300570,5,0,astute1011,237,73,1,70.4,"July 16, 2019","A fantastic puzzle game where you build voxel space factories while under the watchful eye of alien overlords. Using simple tools and trial and error, you build complex machines capable of transforming components into products. It's a lax experience that's easy to dive into, but challenging to master. It's extremely accessible, and provides a welcome playground for experimentation and critical thinking. While it may look intimidating, it's actually very engaging.Infinifactory follows the tale of a human, specifically you, that has been abducted by mentally-inept alien overlords. Outfitted with a space suit and a set of tools, you're put to work creating various automated production lines. You'll produce everything from structural supports, satellites, shuttles, tanks, and even agricultural products. In the beginning, you have basic metal blocks for support, and conveyors for moving items around. As you progress, you gain extra tools such as welders, pistons, sensors, and rotators. Each new tool is quite simple on the surface, but can exhibit a surprising amount of variant behaviours. As you learn and improve your methods, you begin to discover profound interactions between tools, which leads to you creating complicated symphonies of parts working together to systematically assemble a complex component.For example, using structural blocks with welders can create welding lines for assembling metal beams. Using pistons, conveyors, and a sensor with a free floating structural block can be used as a timer or a counter. Using pistons or rotators with a free floating welder can be used like a robo-welding arm or spot welder. Using lifters and blockers with a string of vertical welders can be operated as a sort of mold-press for a large frame component. I realize that most of that sounds like gibberish to the uninitiated, but it's quite easy to follow once you've become familiar with the game and its tools.In that vein, the game is actually quite easy to pick up and play. Early levels ease you in with limited options and very simple inputs. Every concept in the game is taught visually, by showing and doing, rather than telling or explaining. The game nudges you along, showing you brief glimpses of more complex designs, usually illustrated on some billboard or info panel. Each puzzle throws in a slight variation or relatively small addition to push you out of your comfort zone, but never to the point of overwhelming you. Even the later levels do a pretty good job of only introducing one new issue at a time, rather than railroading you with a daunting task.Despite having a reasonably large selection of tools at your disposal, it never feels like any of them are underused. Each tool is carefully crafted to always play a role in whatever you are building. It would have been easy to bloat the experience with too much choice, but here there is restraint. Even late game, when potential upgrades to existing tools are introduced, they never outshine the original versions. Honestly, such careful balance is rather impressive from a game design perspective.Another marvelous aspect to Infinifactory is the ability to tease out creative and critical thinking. Having played SpaceChem beforehand, I was a bit worried that this would go down the same path. SpaceChem was simple at first, but ultimately brutal in its difficulty curve. The limitation of 2D, the split nature of having multiple puzzle areas connecting to each other, and the fact that you were punished for every collision made SpaceChem a headache at times. I was enthusiastic about the problem solving aspect of SpaceChem, but not the ""instant fail state for every mistake"" style of gameplay.Here, however, is where Infinifactory shines. The space used for building your factory is very lax and open. Just solve the puzzle in the most efficient, complex, minimal, or convoluted way you please. As long as the input becomes the output and leaves the level, you're all good. It's this gentle trial and error environment that makes Infinifactory much more accessible and enjoyable, fostering both creative and critical thinking, rather than restraining it.You see your input, your output, and your tools, and begin work by just trying something. You break the problem down. You focus on one piece at a time. You test. You iterate. You tweak. Eventually, everything seems to fall into place. You step back and watch your factory move, in an almost poetic fashion, as it busily snaps together the requested output. All the while you're thinking, ""Wow, I can't believe I made this.""This even lends itself well in terms of replayability. After each completed puzzle, you're given a score based on speed, size, and the number of blocks used. This is a sort of high score, but very vague and based primarily on brackets rather than individual players. Instead of feeling a sigh of relief for finishing, you dive back in and try to tweak your system to improve your score. I have never been a fan of a scoreboards in games, but this particular aspect made it enthralling rather than frustrating.It may sound like work, but it's actually quite hypnotic. I haven't really binged a game like this in a long time, but Infinifactory would grab hold of my attention and not let go.I did have one issue with the game, but its mostly subjective. For the most part, the game is a work of art, but it occasionally fails to inform the player of critical game knowledge. The first half of the game is pretty smooth, but the second half relies a bit too much on knowing specific strategies to win. In multiple levels near the end, I wasted several hours or even days trying to solve a puzzle without knowing the gimmick. I'd have frequent restarts after hours of work, or large stretches of no progress at all. One level in particular introduced a new block that was never announced, and I ended up building a complicated 500 block punch card machine that ran on a variable timer. I had to look up hints online for a few of the last ones, as a reasonable solution required some technique I hadn't discovered yet.Of course, it's worth noting that the second half of the game came as free DLC after the fact, so there was likely a nice window of time between the first and second halves, where players toned up their factory making skills in the internum. Going into the second half of the game immediately feels a bit difficulty dissonant when you're still a relative newcomer to the game.In conclusion, Infinifactory is an amazing masterpiece of game design engineering. It fosters thinking and problem solving, while also being captivating and rewarding. It's very accessible and easy to learn, teaching through visuals and trial and error. Its puzzles are playgrounds for experimentation and creativity. It may look daunting, but it's actually relaxing and engaging. Perhaps you never thought you'd be able to build something so marvelously complex, yet soberingly poetic. Well, maybe now you can.Steam Curator"

Normally I am supossed to solve a problem at least in 3 ways to score good at 3 different aspects we are getting scored for but I am too lazy to do that so I am trying to find best solution I could and then I'm moving on :D at first I was not able to score better than avarage of players but as time passed, I became able to pass the avarage score at one or sometimes two different aspects with only one solution. The improvement I feel and the feeling of being proud of the work I've done is what makes me want to play this game more. 10/10 would recommend to anyone who likes to solve puzzles or problems."

The catch? You're doing this for a bunch of space aliens. They abduct you right at the beginning. Nope, you never learn their language, nor they yours. You're basically a slave.It blends very well the industrial feel of Factorio (machines, materials processing, thousands of conveyor belts) with the mechanics of Big Pharma (alter and/or combine stuff from A and B, get it to C) and the world-navigation of Minecraft (~1m 3D blocks, no part limit, endless flying around, mouse click to place or remove).It's an excellent combination; despite not knowing if my abductors were fundamentally honourable or not, or even what they wanted all this stuff for (though the 'javelins' were pretty obvious), I found myself wanting to make the best damn solution I could, every time. Instead of solving each puzzle as soon as I could and moving on to bigger and better things, I spent ages optimising all my designs until they ran sweet as a nut.The best way to do it is to build it bit by bit, and see what happens during each stage of the manufacturing process, improving as you go until the final product is ready. However, I derived immense satisfaction from building the whole thing in one go, working it out in my head, then starting it all up and watching everything click perfectly into place. That method hardly ever works, though.If, like me, this was all you were expecting from a game literally describing itself as an infinite factory, then you may be surprised. This game is at least a little deeper than it looks. If you're the sensitive type, watch out for Training Routine 5.I haven't finished this game yet - that's true for most of my games, actually - but if you really like factories in general and Factorio in particular, and really wished that it was in full 3D; then you should probably play Satisfactory instead. That is, unless you prefer a large number of small puzzles to one sprawling, continuous puzzle, and you really really like being by yourself.Seeing as the space aliens have you in a cell for the majority of your stay with them, there is no possibility of cooperating with anyone at all. There's a little more info on that in level Optical Sensor Array Type 4.Compatibility? This game should work fine for anyone. If my ancient computer with its 2008 motherboard can run it, then so can yours.I'd keep going, but I really need to get back to work. These machines aren't going to make themselv- oh wait."

300570,0,0,Leyvin,623,1,1,57.9,"July 2, 2019","A thoroughly enjoyable strategy logic puzzle game, where the aim is to create a production queue that builds and ships objects from some core components. There is a story line about bureaucratic aliens who've abducted you (similar to the Vogons from Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy) to essentially be slave labour and a rebellion of the enslaved workers. It's a nice addition to what is essentially a clever puzzle game.It has good replay value due to wanting to create better solutions, either to compete with the Online Avg. from other Players or trying to achieve the bonus challenges, which both become quite difficult in the second campaign.The only downside I'd say is that both Campaigns are a little short, and it'd be good to see some additional campaigns.And because it's so short, the difficult ramps up a little quickly after being fairly simply for the first half the game while you're learning. Some better pacing with getting a new Tool to work with, then a few Puzzles (Missions) that focus on that gradually increasing in difficulty with a Final Mission for each Set using all 2-3 Tools you unlock during such would've probably have been better... same with the story; it's not well paced, and somewhat ramps up quickly over a couple of missions rather than the 20 or so you have before hand.Overall I'd definately recommend this as a Chill Out Game, if you're more into (or just enjoy) the challenge of a puzzle rather than non-stop action."

300570,3,0,virtualraptor,609,153,-1,2.4,"June 30, 2019","At first I quite enjoyed the puzzles but it seems the difficulty just fluctuates too much. Spending an hour on building and testing a contraption just to be forced to delete it again and start from scratch is not a sign of clever puzzle building, it's just repetitive and ultimately very boring and frustrating. I also felt like I was missing basic tools to provide satisfactory results earlier on in the game. I dislike the way you have no control over the factory once it is up and running.The building phase isn't exactly fun as the only way to test your contraption is to start the factory. Some sort of simulation-as-you-build or a hint system would have been nice to get things moving along when you're stuck. I'm not entirely sure why I dislike these puzzles. I enjoyed Portal 1 and 2, for example and I think it has to do with being almost immediately rewarded or at least being able to somewhat have a clue of what to do and thus being able to set a goal  and notice progress each step of the way in the aforementioned games. In Infinifactory you can spend all day looking at a puzzle and not come one iota closer to solving it. Experiments, unlike in Portal where you're flying around and actually part of the puzzle, aren't intuitive, they're not playful and you're just not a part of them either. I also didn't quite get the fascination with suffering and death for such a light-hearted title. The humor seems to be in stark contrast to the rather playful theme and does not fit. This, however, didn't really stop me from playing but it didn't make the game any more fun either. Perhaps the puzzles were just too difficult for me. I did not look a single one of them up as I don't want to have one of those 'I never could have figured that one out' moments. I don't play games to be reminded of how dumb I am, you know. So your mile-age may vary. I tried some other games by the same developer and I was never too impressed. Maybe these games are more for people who like to think their way out of a situation and mull things over before setting their plan in motion. I prefer getting to work and adapt to the situation on the fly. This game definitely does not feature that kind of problem-solving."
300570,0,0,Jawajoey,328,39,1,1.5,"June 30, 2019","It's neat. But so far it's much more of a puzzle game than it is a factory simulation.

But there is not a lot of story content and the script is pretty awful, but it has its moments.  I would really have liked to see this go to a seriously dark place, I felt for sure that the second food type mission was going to be soylent green.The only complaint with merit is that you are left to figure things out on your own and while i did not have any problems i also didn't see things at first which I'm sure some other people would have seen.The fact of the matter is that intelligence is going to help you be good at this game, there is no getting away from that and if that's something you struggle with then I would say adjust your expectations accordingly, what i wouldn't say is stay away but the developer could have been more aware that some people need more help than others to get started.The other major point in which people are falling down and having problems is their inability to rate their own performances.This is a challenging game, if you want it to be. Average ability is going to be enough to complete this game but if you want to get top tier scores you are going to have to put some time and care in but most importantly you need to actually understand the scoreboard.There are 3 categories cycles, footprint and blocks. So how fast you have completed the level, your ability to think in 3 dimensions and make use of vertical space and your precision, these are very different things and you should not expect to score highly in all areas, they are mutually exclusive, you optimise your build for 1 of the 3 if you want to after you have completed the level already.There are people posting negative reviews of this game because they expected to score highly on all 3 of these mutually exclusive measures on their first play through. So if what you are seeking is validation and you were expecting a gold star just for turning up this isn't going to be for you. Maybe you should ask mummy for a cuddle? Other complaints I have seen state that after a couple of levels its all just the same thing. This is simply not the case, new features and new problems are introduced with most levels for most of the game and after that what changes is scale which completely changes everything. Techniques you were using with small work pieces may not work on a larger scale and as the production runs become longer and more complex a delay in one area could cause a jam somewhere else.There is a lot going on here and if you like building games like lego you are going to have fun with this game.I would have liked to have seen stronger pushers, more verticality, full if / and / or logic circuits (I don't think you can do this, but maybe I have missed something?) much darker story and content and more turn x into y and use for z type materials.Oh an cranes.. and the ability to rotate group selections.Biggest problem i had by far is that the change tool interface doesn't always seem to work, i think it could be something like I am releasing the shift button a microsecond before i am left clicking to select and it doesn't allow for and fix my garbage human input. Which is important, good ui's intuit what you meant to do rather than listening to what you actually did.Its not street fighter, I shouldn't have to pull off a combo move into the laser blocks face to select it. Left clicking should be just fine."

The essence of the game is using conveyor belts, welders, pistons, and other devices to assemble blocks into a particular shape, while being constrained by space and environmental layout. Yes, this is essentially a lego factory. These puzzles require serious thought and planning, so this game is not for the easily frustrated. Difficulty ramps up pretty quickly, and often you will discover the approach you were trying just won't work, and you have to start all over. One odd design decision is that the explanation for new blocks first appears only as a simple drawing, and the full text description appears only AFTER you have first solved a puzzle with the blocks.This is a game I play in spurts. The frustration factor makes me give up on it after a while, and come back later. Compared to the other Zachtronics games I have played, I rank it like this:1. Opus Magnum (This game is a masterpiece)2. Shenzen IO3. Infinifactory4. TIS-100 (I really didn't like this one)Inifnifactory is ok.

I felt a ton of autonomy in the design of my factories, so each puzzle felt like a unique individual experience as I learned the mechanisms by which to best optimize my own solutions. That being said, the game suffers pretty severely from being a three-dimensional game; I feel as if the extent to which altitude comes into any sort of meaningful consideration in the game is pretty low, yet it adds a lot of menial clicking around to incorporate into solution designs. In that respect, this game is definitely a super slow burner; very little time is spent ""designing"" compared to the very high amount of time required for ""implementation"". This in itself isn't terrible if there is a degree of fun or pleasure in the implementation process, but for me it was not a core appeal.The setting is mildly depressing and the soundtrack is not especially commendable, but the game is easy on the eyes nevertheless.

Unlike a lot of puzzle games where you are left feeling like an idiot for not realizing the solution sooner, this game makes you feel like a genius because *you* are the one creating the solution. When you build a factory, it is as much a creative endeavor as it is an intellectual one, and you are pushed to make your factory more elegant. There are some minor downsides that you get used to fairly quickly. One or two things that are not properly explained. The only *major*downside of this game is the difficulty curve. The first 50% of this game is a smooth ramp up in difficulty and feels very natural. 51% - 90% is a plateu, and you don't feel like it is getting at all more complicated as it goes along.

An (almost) entirely unconstrained sandbox environment is presented for the crafting and and optimization of a solution. Each puzzle allows for three separate solutions to be constructed and saved, and each solution is scored on three metrics. Your low score from each is counted towards your overall score, which invites the player to create 3 unique solutions for each puzzle in order to achieve the lowest combined score .Lovely atmospheric music, loads of workshop puzzles to keep you going, and a zero-lag UI? It's a perfect way to unwind after work. Watching your little factory methodically stamp out product is much more satisfying than it should be.

If you've played any of their other games you know mostly what to expect, and I'd recommend it. The move to 3D from Spacechem allows them to add more tools that you can build with, and another dimension to work in for complexity. Many worlds feature unique gimmicks that mix things up too.If you haven't played a Zachtronic's game, it's a puzzle game, but not the normal sort. You are given tools, and have to engineer A solution, rather than find THE solution. I'd recommend it if you like problem solving, or the sense of accomplishment you get from coding. My only complaint is that the later levels begin to feel too much like work.Also, I'd be remiss without mentioning that, despite the story being mostly there for dark humour, the environments and chill electronic music really sell the locations you're in."

Thankfully the building controls are excellent. There is some uneveness in the difficulty level, although as you progress you can rebuild elements you will have learned by solving previous puzzles. Over time you will build various solutions to fabrication stages that can be tweaked, repeated, adapted and optimised to construct fantastically elaborate factories to puzzles that hours previously threatened to melt your brain. Learn that only a single block needs to be touching a conveyor belt to travel along it (you can have real-world-impossible constructions overhanging the belt without it falling off). Understand that you can use the next unwelded block or construction to push a completed object further on its way. Discover that having parts travel forwards, backwards, up, down, sideways, rotated, looped, delayed and in parallel are sometimes the only way to get large constructions made in a tight spot. And if you really struggle there are tip videos on youtube that teach you construction methods without giving away the solutions.If you like puzzles, engineering and building things then this is one game you absolutely must play.

Even after you solve a puzzle, you can go back and try to minimize your scores, or even just try an entirely defferent solution.

The interface and controls are fairly intuitive and easy to learn and I had not problem getting back into game after not playing it for months - and it is a game you can come back to again and again.Although the framing story for the puzzle problems, involving being abducted by aliens, is a little weak if you have been paying attention then a there is piece of tat which are given which is absolutely heartbreaking."

Others have classified this as a ""problem solving"" game as opposed to a ""puzzle"" game, and I think that's fair. You're given tools with which to solve increasingly complex problems, and you're free to approach the problems however you can. It's about sitting down, breaking the problem into parts, figuring out the details, and bringing it all together. At the end of a (later) level, your solution will be more complex than you could have pictured or comprehended before you started going at it; but, more importantly, it will be your solution. And that's brilliant."

There are multiple ways to solve these problems, so the replayability is super high. The faster/more simple your solution is, the better. I'm not even that far into the game and I'm already wondering how it's going to keep getting HARDER. But, Zachtronics games seem to always been constructed in such a way that as difficulty rises, it never seems like it is becoming an insurmountable task. There is also some story that unfolds as you move through the game, but I would by no means consider this a ""story-rich"" game, or even as story focused as a game like Portal. However, it doesn't matter to a player like me as I am here for the puzzles."

There are some pretty broken things about it that really insanely smart people can abuse like crazy (lookin' at you, rotator blocks), but even your average guy will get a bit of a rush when the complicated assembly line turns out a working product. I'm writing this review shortly after beating the Fusion Reactor level, which stumped me for many hours. I came back after a year away from the game with fresh eyes, and the sense of accomplishment I got from finally completing it is really great.On top of that core reward loop, you've got good controls, an interesting story, and excellent art.

How would you know if you'd like this sort of game or not???  I guess if you think you -might- like this sort of game, this is probably the one I'd recommend starting with.I do have a theory that this would make a great intro to programming.  I think it does a great job of introducing the idea of breaking a process down into logical sub steps.  But because of the 3D and more 'tangible' activity you're accomplishing, it seems totally removed from the 2d wall of syntax people seem to have trouble with.I would recommend giving it a while since it has sort of a slow start.  I'm a fan of all the Zachtronics games but I was several (maybe as many as a dozen?) levels into this one before I really got into it.  I was even thinking about returning it!

It's very intuitive, which is a good thing because unlike most of Zachtronics' other games there's no 30-page-long manual to understand the mechanics; they just throw you into the game with a few tools and continually drip-feed new tools to keep the solutions more and more complex. I'd personally recommend this to people who are new to this studio's games and want a warm-up before diving into the depths with something like Opus Magnum or SpaceChem.I'm not the best judge of music, so I'm not going to rate it one way or the other. The sound effects, however, are very satisfying, particularly when you've got a complex machine constantly pushing and welding in rhythm.Visually speaking, it looks like a massively updated Infiniminer. While it's tough to say that it has the same sort of striking visuals as some of their other games, more than anything it needs to be evidently clear which bit of a Rube Goldbergian assembly line does what, and in that regard they are successful.More so than anything, the only advice I can really give is: Experiment. Test out all the different blocks and the way they interact with each other. The more little quirks you notice, the more you feel like a genius and the more satisfying it will be when it all comes together."

The puzzles themselves are fairly fun and its very satisfying to watch the creation you've made ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ after a long time tinkering.That being said, the fact that they made this first person really does it no favors. It makes things take longer to tinker with and makes building feel a bit cludgier. There doesn't seem to be any real reason or need for it to have been 1st Person and that design decision seems actively makes the game feel a little worse. Additionally, the storyline itself seems far weaker than the other games they have made, nor does the art design really stick with me like any of their other games do.

It's been a while since I played, but the last thing I remember is being up in the early hours of the morning designing a system that would slice up a whale and send its white and dark meat into separate processing stations.Okay, but it doesn't start off that way. The thing starts you off real easy like. Gives you a few primitives and tells you to move some simple stuff around. No big deal. Next thing you know you are slaughtering whales and making guns for some aliens. I need to pick it back up again, but it was so addictive I had to uninstall it. It had me captive and I fell in love with it in proper Stockholm style. I was seeing this game when I closed my eyes.

I recommend the game for it's first half, where I really though like my mind was adapting to the rules of the game, and slowly increased my efficiently came naturally. The eureka moments are great where you think of new concepts.However If you are not confident in your problem solving abilities, like myself, I recommend stopping at the mid point (clearly divided, you'll know) as the later puzzles start to feel like you are fighting the game rather that fighting your brain. Stuff like material efficiency seems like a cheap way of making you restart a puzzle 1 hour in. By the end of the game I was spending multiple hours on each factory and seeing the factory break on items 7 was heartbreaking.The main mechanics were great but I would have prefered some more functionality. For example timers and auto-toggles. A copy/paste page, saved custom parts. The other thing that would help is guidebook for different systems, this would allow for a more natural understanding of concepts, instead of the nature of having a non-efficient version that ends up ruining your build."

I like these types of games and have written good reviews on a few Zachtronic games. I really want to write a good review of Infinifactory but I can't. My problem with this game is while it is okay to invest some time in order to solve a problem, there is such a thing as making it too hard to figure out. Right from the first training puzzle, the thing I felt was missing that was not the case in other Zachtronic games was the needed components to construct the solution. Shenzhen IO, TIS/100 and SpaceChem always had enough of the basic elements -- motion, a grabber, and a switch -- to complete the problem. With infinifactory, the grabber -- which in this case would be a clamp -- was missing and it was sorely needed on the third training puzzle where I had to weld a vertical two-block stack, then move the union to the transporter. There was simply no way to join two falling objects at different altitudes into a union and then at command move the union to the transporter. I spent a total of 2 and a half hours on that one puzzle before finally giving up and uninstalling.When something becomes too hard to do, it stops being enjoyable. Infinifactory made the learning curve much too steep at the beginning and I truly feel it should have followed a more shallow incline demonstrated in the other games."

Your role is to design and construct the ""factory"" to make each construction. In order to prove that your process works, you must deliver 10 perfect copies of the requested item to a ""scanner"" that validates that each copy delivered is correct. As you progress, you are given additional tools, more challenging conditions/restrictions and more complicated items to assemble. I first learned about this game through a YouTube reference/review from Mark Brown's Game Maker's Tool Kit (search for it and watch it) that put this game in the genre of ""Problem-Solving"" rather than ""Puzzle-Solving"". The distinction is worth noting. This game allows you to develop many potential solutions to each problem - and rates you on the time, moving part and space efficiency of your solution in the form of showing your performance relative to that of all the other Steam players.You have unlimited design time to develop your solutions, and, apart from the final level, there are no practical time limits to how long your solution can take. There's even an achievement (""Subversive Engineering"") for the running time of your (successful) solution being a really long time. Because you learn to use each new element one at a time, I never found the learning curve too intimidatingly steep, and the sense of reward when you solve a problem stage is strong. It is also possible to ""finish"" the game without completing all of the problem scenarios, in case there's one that you are having fits over.  I've put over 150 hours into this game. Not because it's difficult to complete, although some of the campaign puzzles can really stretch your brain, but because I've wanted to ""beat"" the efficiency requirements to get all the achievements and develop better solutions.Although there is Workshop support, I haven't done any of the Workshop levels yet.

300570,0,0,crealstarvertifier,370,7,1,57.7,"November 19, 2017","Rating: 8.5Highly recommendedInfinifactory is a very challenging but fair 3D puzzle game. The goal is to take the component blocks supplied and construct/deconstruct them as the 'end goal' displays. This game is not unfair, as the only true obstacle between you and completing the puzzle is your own ability to make the production line between point A and point B. While there is one single puzzle from my memory that has 'RNG' applied to it, the rest of the puzzles are predictable and do not throw anything unexpected or unpredictable at you. The puzzles do ramp up in complexity rather fast, but the goal of each puzzle stays the same, only with more blocks added in to the solution. There is no point where you should feel like you’re fighting the game to complete a puzzle, and each finished level gave a strong sense of satisfaction.The story isn't remarkable, but not unwelcome. When it comes to puzzle games I don't expect story as I am only there for the challenge the puzzles provide, but what was added to this game felt entertaining enough for me to enjoy. The setting as well adds variety to the environments you work in, changing things up just when the surroundings might start to feel same-y. The art style has a cartoon-y feel to it that I enjoy and has been fairly memorable, but I attribute that more to the unforgettable difficulty the game provides rather than the art style itself. The soundtrack is good, the kind of music that plays in the background and does not distract the player while getting rid of any uncomfortable silence, but is also something nice to listen to when you need to step back from a puzzle and think about it without intense focus.Another small feature that adds to the challenge of the game is the scoreboards of ‘Cycles’, how fast you can complete the goal, ‘Footprint’, minimizing the area your factory takes up, and ‘Blocks’, minimizing the utility blocks added in to your factory. There are no scores by the game that you’re expected to beat, but each puzzle shows a chart of scores other users have received on the same puzzle. It adds an extra, but entirely optional, challenge in for you to try and optimize your factory as best as you can.Ironically I have not beaten this game, but this is due to my own shortcomings rather than the game. Despite getting stuck I still have a fair bit of time logged and found the game to be highly addictive. The difficulty near the end is very high, and while I do know the solution exists, my own perfectionism and impatience has made me take a bit of a break from the game. That being said, I still think the game is fantastic and unfortunately very underrated, as there isn't anything I can really complain about when it comes to Infinifactory. Zachtronics knew what they wanted to do, they set out and did it, and everything about it feels right. Come to the game for the puzzle, and enjoy the sci-fi worlds they added in while you're bashing your head on your desk trying to figure out one of the level solutions.The only reason this game is not a 10/10 is because they decided to add in a story that was average, but without the story or variation in level environments, I do not think it would be worth the current price tag."

I have only played the first 2 levels so maybe I haven't gotten to it yet, but I am waiting for the use of AND/OR logic or even normally closed and normally open circuits (ie. let this pusher block stay extended until an object hits the sensor and lets it close). This makes building the circuits a little longer than I'd like.Difficulty-wise, it's just right. I feel my mind working even though the levels aren't too hard. Someone mentioned the use of computers and I'm assuming Zach's going to use assembly language for it because he seems to like that. I'm going to review this game and put it on YouTube when I've finally completed it. I just got the game today and honestly, I do not regret my purchase.So far, the game gets a 9/10 from me.

After that, you can start to think more creatively about solutions.On each level it is usually frustratingly hard at first to come up with a strategy that will work. You try something to get an idea of the flow of the level and at some point after you've scratched your head and gone back to the drawing board a couple of times, you have a eureka moment. It is very satisfying to hone a machine to peak productivity and compare your results with the efforts of your Steam friends.

Factory parts are free, but you can't touch anything while the factory runs. If it works, great! If not, resume factory building and fix the flaw. These puzzles will challenge your skill in timing, sequencing, and 3D geometry.

The levels introduce new ideas in a gradual way, and then build on those ideas with more and more challenging levels.  There is no ""right"" way to solve a level, which allows you to be creative and to try out different ideas.  You can also compare your solution to others' via a few metrics to see how your solution stacks up.I found the levels to have a massive amount of replay value.  I enjoyed iterating on solutions to streamline them, looking at other peoples' solutions on youtube for inspiration, and revisiting older levels when I was a more advanced player.  And, even if you do beat the game and solve every level with maximum efficiency, there are user-created Steam Workshop levels which introduce even more new ideas and challenges.The game also has a light but coherent story, a sense of humor, and is fairly polished.Infinifactory is also much bigger than you think it is.  Just when you think you have beaten the game, an entire second campaign is unlocked, with a ton of new levels, a lot of new and interesting ideas, and builds on the story in a satisfying way.Some people have mentioned the ""physics"" of this game.  The engine has what I call ""Game of Life"" physics, by which I mean:  All the blocks are constrained to a grid, and a block can only move one square per cycle.  It's very intuitive when you play it, but it is definitely not ""real life"" physics.A+, 10/10, one of my favorite games."

So far (15 hours in), I found that objectives will either involve assembling multiple copies of some gizmo from scratch, or modifying/upgrading pre assembled gizmos that show up.The game lets you loose without a lot of hand holding, which means there is a learning curve which people may respond differently to. You will know if you are adjusting well to that curve if you find yourself getting inspiration from what you did in prior scenarios, as you naturally develop your own arsenal of small solutions or sub-mechanisms. On the other hand, things are probably bad if you find yourself completely stomped and overwhelmed at each scenario with no idea on how to start.I would agree with those who say this is like Spacechem in 3D. If you haven't played that one, I highly recommend it.

I fully recommend it as a puzzle game, but I can't recommend it as a physics-based puzzle game.As a puzzle game, it's got a lot going for it:  it's challenging without being too difficult (so far), it's logic-based, the controls are mostly intuitive, and it's even got sort of a story/lore with some decent humor.However, this game must take place in some alternate universe where the laws of physics aren't applied evenly, and that bugs me.  Since you're scored on how many blocks you use for your solution (with fewer blocks being better), you often have to come up with solutions to the puzzles that would not work in real life to get a good score.  For instance, if you need to make a structure that is three blocks wide, you only need to support one of those blocks with a conveyor belt, and it doesn't matter which one.  That means you could have a conveyor under the leftmost block with nothing supporting the middle or right blocks, and the whole thing will keep moving along the conveyor as though the center of mass is supported when it clearly isn't.  That diminishes the game somewhat for me, but I realize that's a personal preference and that not everybody will care about that, hence the split recommendation."

If you're familiar with Zachtronics' other titles and liked them at all, stop wasting your time reading this and run-do-not-walk to the ""buy"" button.If you're not familiar with the genre or the other titles, let me put it like this: you're building a factory.  You get some collection of stuff in, and some tools (conveyor belts, welders, etc) which you arrange into a production line to build a specific requested product.  You have essentially infinite freedom for what to build, and the _first_ puzzle is figuring out how to make what you want.  Then things get a little OCD.Every solution you build to a puzzle is scored on three factors: how fast you solved it, how many pieces you used, and how ""big"" your solution was (for a measure of bigness that is not worth trying to define here.)  And it shows you how well yours scored compared to other users who have played the game.  Even if you're not the competitive type, it's awfully hard not to look at the fact that someone else solved it in half the time, think ""That's impossible!  Well maybe if I..."" and look up 4 hours later from the ruins of your civilization to realize that you are now addicted to this game.  Often times optimizing your solution one way will make it hilariously inefficent according to one of the other two scoring factors, so you'll end up solving the same problem many times.The game is also set in a quirky-but-dark setting with a nice touch of humour.  It doesn't impose on the gameplay much (yet) but it does add a nice tone.  The interface is quick and intuitive.  The music and art assets are well-done, and the support is nothing short of phenomenal - I emailed Zachtronics with an issue and got a response from the developer within minutes (not that you should expect that every time, but I was still impressed... especially since the issue was actually User Error.)Thanks Zach!  Great game!"
300570,1,0,elimik31,142,8,1,26.1,"April 10, 2017","Amazing and addictive puzzle game. I have played several other Zachtronics games before, so I knew this would be hard, but it is not as hard as I feared. I have played it about 20 hours now and I am through most of the first campaign, but I know that there is more to come and it will get more difficult. So far I had very few moments of frustration, though I had to take a break sometimes and think about a problem. I never felt the need to use online solutions, though it might be helpful to look at some of the user guides with some tips and tricks. In contrast to other Zachtronics games, I felt that the levels are quite large, so there is a lot of room for unelegant solutions, which still do the job.Due to the 3D the game is much more immersive than other Zachtronics games and I like that it feels like you are constructing factories to manufacture actual stuff, like spaceships, tanks and packaged meat. It runs very smoothly on my non-gaming notebook, looks pretty enough and the backgrounds are gorgeous. The music is nice and not distracting, good for long periods of concentration. The story or setting reminded me of ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"". It is funny and bizarre, but also sad at times. I really makes me want to know how it continues and I actually care for some of the characters (Floyd). However, I cannot judge how it will be in the later part of the game.In the game you get different inputs and have to build a factory to create something as an output (for example a Sattelite). Otherwise you are given total freedom, so you can get really creative and in the end you are really proud of your own, personal solution. It is not a puzzle game in the sense that there is a predefined solution that you have to find, which is what I like about Zachtronics games. The puzzles (at least in the first campaign) feel all quite different, so it does not get repetitive. In some way it is like programming, because you can use sensors for kind of ""if then"" instructions: ""If there is a block at this position, active that pusher in that other location"". But you don't have to be a programmer, it is just some logic thinking. It's fun.For the moment I will stop playing this game because I have an exam soon, which is why I am doing the review now. But this will take me some effort, I really want to continue playing it."

Pros+ Challenging Gameplay+Finishing levels gives a great sense of satisfaction+The audio logs are very interestingCons-Game doesn't seem to know quite what its tone is supposed to be. The times when you interact with the aliens are funny and goofy, but the audio logs you find on the bodies of your predecessors are pretty dark and haunting. There's even a  dead dog  within the first few levels. The uneven tone of the game doesn't take away from the gameplay, but I wish they had gone either serious or silly all the way/-Visually, not great. The visuals seem pretty utilitarian in their purpose. They show what you need to see with no bells and whistles. Lighting isn't great, either.-Music gets old fast, especially when spending a long time on a level. I usually play my own music unless I find one of the audio logs.In spite of the cons I've listed, I would still highly reccomend it.

There are numerous scenarios and ""gimmicks"" throughout the game which change it up enough so not to get tedious, as well as a workshop for player-submitted maps.In terms of replay-ability, it's a puzzle game so not much.

The player will unlock more machine parts and mechanics as they progress.The games interesting story is initially told through tape recordings that the player will find in different levels.The levels seemingly easy but quickly get more difficult as the game progresses. There are many different ways in which to construct the different production lines in each stage and the player is rewarded for making their factory as efficient as possible. This game is sure to frustrate any player but they will be rewarded for their determination.This game has elements from, and can be compared to, other games such as Factorio and Minecraft, but it is also very different from those games in other ways and is more than capable of being considered independent from those games.Positive Aspects+Fun and interesting puzzle mechanics.+Excellent soundtrack.+Freedom to solve puzzles in different ways, with more efficient ways being rewarded.+Good story, however, the story does not at first have a central role in the game.+Very relaxing, yet difficult gameplay. (opinion)+Workshop support for creating new levels.+Nice aesthetic.+Good learning curve.+Longer that it seems.

That's what elevates it above awkward programming for me. Out of the Zachtronics games I've played, Infinifactory captures this aspect best.The workshop integration also adds a lot of value. The built-in puzzle design, as in all Zachtronics games, tends to favor big-and-messy puzzles as the game progresses, and I'm more a fan of small-and-clean puzzles. Many of the workshop puzzles offer this sort of design, in particular Aap op Sokken's ""Way Too Fast"" series.Compared to 2D Zachtronics games, it is less challenging to complete puzzles in Infinifactory because having 3 dimensions available means you are less space constrained.

The game is good, I can't say otherwise, but I've played 3 Zachtronics games, Spacechem, Opus Magnum, and this. This was by far the hardest one I'd say. The final chapter difficulty spike is HUGE. Beyond anything in Spacechem, and harder than the Post-game of Opus Magnum. The ""final chapter"" of Opus was by far the easiest though, and the post-game offers no achievements so even the devs didn't seem to expect you to be too concerned by it.The main thing that makes this game so much harder is that you don't go at your own pace. You have an input adjustment, but without some very messy effort on your end, you're always at the whims of how fast the game gives you objects. And in the final chapter, the objects you are expected to make just don't allow for you to mess around with how you're fed objects. And while some of the chapters right before the final one were hard, the spike in difficulty is just... huge. It's too big, really. It turns what was extremely fun to figure out into pure tedium.It borders on rediculousness. But if extremely hard puzzles are your thing, this is actually right for you. If you want a hard puzzle game that feels a bit more fair, go for Spacechem. For as hard as that one gets, it was my favorite of the three games."

Played a lot of Factorio instead and decided to come back to this after that and oh boy, did this turn out to be a gem. Absolutely addictive as soon as you get past the intro levels. Makes me wish I pulled through when I initially got it.You're building factory systems, and just like in Factorio with getting some beautiful ratio setups, it's as satisfying as solving a (complex) math equation. The fact that you get a direct performance review after completing is stimulating rather than daunting, and the overall world building with the aliens giving you food pellets and nonsensical performance reviews works great to set the tone.If you love logic / logistics and are partial to puzzles this is a must-get. Any Zachtronics game is, really."

This one is another of my favorites.  The levels are well designed, with a constantly increasing difficulty until you feel like it's time to give up.  But you push through, learn tricks, and keep moving forward.  I still prefer the darkish humor in Spacechem, but this one also got several good laughs."

Like all Zachtronics games, it starts off hard and gets so hard you will lose days of your life just trying to debug your solution. It's infuriating and I loved every minute of it. On a scale of Opus Magnum to Space Chem, it's definitely in between. You can expand your solution into three dimensions if you need it, so it's not so limiting as Space Chem, but the jetpack you fly around on will automatically return you if you drift too far from your work area, so it's not infinite like Opus Magnum. Like with other Zachtronics games, it's not about getting the solution right, but getting it right consistently (like a smooth-running factory), so you have to make 10 of a thing to count as a success. There are also achievements you can work toward and optimizations, like using fewer blocks, less square footage, or fewer number of cycles to reach your solution, so there is replayability. There are new mechanics introduced every few stages (antigrav lifts, switches, drills, etc.) so there's a great variety of tools so you can solve puzzles a variety of ways.As for the story--yes, there is actually a story! You have been abducted by alien overlords who are forcing you to build things like weapons, shields, and even ""meat products"" for them. You find out about the world first through audio logs and then...well, you'll just have to play.I played for over a hundred hours to beat this game and made whale patties. 10/10"

Instead of having only one correct solution to a level that either works or it doesn't you get Minecraft-like freedom to build any crazy machine you want and if it produces the right outputs, you get to compare its speed(cycles), size(footprint) and cost(blocks) to those submitted by other players (and of course improve it until you feel really smart =)6. Good graphics and interesting gradual reveal of the world through messages left by long-dead puzzle solvers. 5.

The game really builds off itself as it teaches you mechanics and you develop your own language for sub-routines. Super fun!

I felt like an idiot after finally beating each level and seeing my awful score, but it is so satisfying making your own solution to each of these puzzles. Tutorial is very well paced and I believe anyone can pick up this game and have a great time"
