0,2704,"Feels like a 3D Factorio with levels instead of open world survival. Good Story, Great Music, and Amazing Gameplay!"
1,2704,Ruined with blasphemy and profanity. For what reason?
2,2703,I would maybe recommend it if it's on sale and you just want a puzzle game that's going to sit around
3,2703,"For the price, it's totally not worth it. Maybe $5. I'd much more recommend Mindustry, Factorio, or satisfactory."
4,2703,This is a fun puzzle game with a fun story though the latter levels get crazy. good game overall
5,2702,"It reminds me of Rubik's Games from 1999.Puzzles get difficult perhaps a bit too early, as they can take some time to solve.The game will be 100% saved if you Alt+F4. Even starting you at the puzzle the next time you launch.You progress by solving puzzles, not by how you solved them.It's very addictive, and time flies very fast when you're immersed. No day/night cycle doesn't help your sense of real time.Don't forget to sleep."
6,2701,"After a lot of time with this game, this is an easy recommend. However, if you aren't into this type of logic game where you have to think and use your brain 24/7 while playing, and instead want to play a game that helps you relax, this aint it. I myself love the way this game is laid out, and it also gets brownie points for running on a potato macbook or a M1 using rosetta."
7,2701,I found the levels got increasingly tedious instead of more interesting and challenging.
8,2700,"I really love this game. 3d world puzzle block builder. Great levels and each one can be played simply to complete or try to optimize for speed, area, or block count giving each level a lot of enjoyment to continue to optimize after first completing it."
9,2699,"A really polished, eraly assembly and design game - really, the first space engineers as far as I'm concerned. Beautiful, smooth, interesting to play - even used it to teach introduction to Industrial Design. Thoroughly enjoyable."
10,2697,List of Zachtronics games that involve you writing in assembly and or making a factory:InfinifactorySpaceChemOpus MagnumTIS-100ExapunksShenzhen I/Oiss good
11,2697,Infinifactory is a lot of fun. It tricks you into doing programming puzzles with a layer of factory abstraction on top :)
12,2696,"Funny enough the story is really immersive. You get kidnaped by aliens and are forced to designs factories for them. They reward you with space croquettes to eat. Then something happens...puzzles are very fun. Everything you make is technically made out of the same stupid block with different skins, but somehow  the illusion works. You'll truly feel like you are assembling tanks and massive missiles that get used in battle. You'll build cars, carve whales and do many other fun stuff like it."
13,2696,good puzzles. hard puzzles.
14,2695,"Infinifactory is a good puzzle game, that I would recommend checking out. Assembling and transporting objects is a fun challenge and its pretty satisfying to go over a solution again to improve it.If I have one criticism, its that levels towards the end get more tedious, because objects become more unwieldy and you also have to make sure that your assembly line doesnt block the objects. I seriously slowed down at the end and didnt have the motivation to improve my solutions, and I even dropped the game for like a year. After I came back and finished it, the final level still left me kinda frustrated, because the last challenge was less on how to construct an object and more how to keep my assembly line from blocking it.Still I would recommend this game, even if its more for its earlier levels than its later levels."
15,2694,Who knew making factories for aliens would be so fun?
16,2694,Starts off well then the difficulty spikes before you really have any fundamentals down. Also the story seems very odd.
17,2694,It feels good when everything comes together
18,2692,"Played it many years ago, got stuck on a later puzzle and never beat it. I'd like to some day but it's not super exciting."
19,2692,S'Good
20,2692,"Infinifactory is one of those games that makes you feel smart when you beat a level. There are some pretty broken things about it that really insanely smart people can abuse like crazy (lookin' at you, rotator blocks), but even your average guy will get a bit of a rush when the complicated assembly line turns out a working product. I'm writing this review shortly after beating the Fusion Reactor level, which stumped me for many hours. I came back after a year away from the game with fresh eyes, and the sense of accomplishment I got from finally completing it is really great.On top of that core reward loop, you've got good controls, an interesting story, and excellent art. The game isn't pretentious, and it doesn't need to be. Not everyone will play past the first couple levels. But it's well worth the price for those who will go even a little further."
21,2691,Best abducted-by-aliens-and-forced-to-do-puzzles simulator on the market.
22,2691,"Too messy. No proper menu, cant reset your progress, can't go back. So basically, if you stop playing for a while, when you play it again and don't remember how to play it you will be done with this game."
23,2690,But maybe the toads weren't so bad after all...
24,2689,Satisfyingly challenging but not super frustrating...with some exceptions
25,2687,build build build
26,2686,"I bought this game thinking I was going to play a factory sim game. But I soon realized it's just a puzzle game, maybe very good for those who appreciate the genre, but very boring form me, I asked refund."
27,2686,"Awesome puzzles, and that awesome dark humor that Zachtronics does so well!"
28,2686,"Infinifactory is a very well made puzzle game. It's graphics, while not being the fanciest, serve the game very well and help to clearly show what is happening in your factory. The puzzle solving is very open ended allowing for more solutions than can be counted. This makes it so that there is no ""correct"" or ""intended"" way to play the game."
29,2686,"Best building,/sandbox style game I've ever played... I love it!!!"
30,2686,A brain burner.  challenging and engaging.
31,2685,this is a game for people who want to SPEND TIME planning and figuring out these maddening puzzles
32,2683,Really fun game about automation
33,2683,"Fun if you like puzzle games and/or programming. It's more about inventing a solution than finding the ""right"" solution."
34,2680,Controls for this game are absolute trash. Puzzles the puzzles are GREAT if you can deal with the horrific control mechanics because wow they are terrible.
35,2679,6/10---{Graphics}--- You forget what reality is Beautiful Good Decent Bad Dont look too long at it Paint.exe---{Gameplay}--- Very good Good Its just gameplay Mehh Starring at walls is better Just dont---{Audio}--- Eargasm Very good Good Not too bad Bad Earrape---{PC Requirements}--- Check if you can run paint Potato Decent Fast Rich boiiiiii Ask NASA if they have a spare computer---{Difficulity}--- Just press A Easy Significant brain usage Easy to learn / Hard to master Hope you like thinking Dark Souls---{Grind}--- Nothing to grind Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks Isnt necessary to progress Average grind level Too much grind Youll need a second live for grinding---{Story}--- Story?

Worth the price If u have some spare money left Not recommended You could also just burn your money---{Bugs}--- Never heard of Minor bugs Can be annoying ARK: Survival Evolved The game itself is a big terrarium for bugsA game for die hard Zachtronics fans and logistics puzzles. The later puzzles are a bit annoying for my liking though.
36,2679,Industrial Engineering the game.
37,2678,
38,2677,+
39,2677,"I like it a lot and I recommend it. it's satisfying.just look at the community content and the screenshots on the store page of the game. tell me this isn't an amazing game. you can create those assembly lines and ""final products"".the game works well. has good puzzles. you can even build something from your imagination (with the tools you have, sure, duhh). I think this is an awesome game.after a while, you have to turn the music sound off."
40,2676,"Zachtronics served us here with a great game expanding and improving on their puzzle concept of Spacechem, this time adding a 3D layer into the mix with a very interesting storyline woven in between."
41,2676,I thought this was satisfactory bro
42,2673,"My brain can't handle thisIt sucks, because this game has no logic gates"
43,2672,Nice game.
44,2672,This game has the deepest lore
45,2672,"Wonderfully fun design game - simple tools that allow interesting solutions to the challenges it presents, whether those solutions be complex or elegantly simple"
46,2670,"This game is pretty great. Quick, factory-making fun that is both frustrating and VERY rewarding at times."
47,2670,That feeling when you've made a factory that works well and you just kicking back watching it go is better than sex
48,2669,"totally addicted to this game.  I appreciate the open solutions.  For most puzzles there are many different ways to solve the puzzles.  Which is what has me hooked.  I enjoy finding new ways to optimize my machines.  There are a few ""impossible"" physics tricks to be exploited. Which, for me, gives me a reason to go back to older puzzles and see where I can utilize them.  If you are a loony, slightly OCD, wacko like me, you will love this game."
49,2669,very good game
50,2669,"I truly wish there would be a sequel to this game. While this it's ultimately boils down to the same principle as other Zachtronics games, it present itself in a way not unlike Satisfactory and similar games, encouraging the player to find the most optimal solution (by whatever standard you measure yourself, for me that would be footprint).Oh, and if you ever get to develop Infinifactory 2, please get rid of the camera that sometimes spawns behind and scares the  out of you. Or at least allow me to disable it."
51,2667,"Just a genuinely phenomenal game - one of the best puzzle/factory games ever made. Levels start off easy and by the end of the (50+ hour) campaign ramp up to HARD, requiring you to actually explore game mechanics yourself to learn about how your blocks interact with each other, not just the provided materials. There are numerous scenarios and ""gimmicks"" throughout the game which change it up enough so not to get tedious, as well as a workshop for player-submitted maps.In terms of replay-ability, it's a puzzle game so not much. But Zach adds special achievements to earlier levels incentivizing optimization or special conditions, as well as having their worldwide leaderboard graphs to push yourself to be the best (or at least of your friends).For your sanity: Use separate solution slots liberally. Ctrl+Z = Undo, Ctrl+Y = Redo."
52,2666,not sure I'm smart enough for this game lol
53,2665,"Very interesting setup, with a plot like Half-Life. Very enjoyable!"
54,2664,This is a unique and very rich puzzle game. You have to build large and intricate assembly lines in 3D to manufacture progressively complex products. I wish there was more like it.
55,2664,"OK so it's a standard Zachtronics puzzle game, except it's in 3D.Reminds me of Cube's, which was a Quake-like engine with real-time multiplayer map editing.  I guess younger people would compare it to Minecraft..."
56,2664,Rada? Rada rada? Rada..?
57,2662,One of the most satisfying puzzle games I've played.
58,2661,"very good game. it even gets better and better as you play and unlock features, blocks, levels and storylines. most things they add into the game also involve storyline events that provide the feature in the game. example: the new level editor is now only accsessable after a new storyline as well"
59,2661,"A fantastic puzzle/optimization game, very enjoyable, lots of replay value if you're one who likes to optimize!"
60,2660,really great game.You are gonna wreck your brain looking for the best solutions
61,2660,"Probably the best Zachtronics game (or Zachlike, from Zachtronics or otherwise) - atmospheric, intuitive, and the 3D aspect allows for the most complex puzzles without overwhelmingly large constructs or finicky space or resource limitations. Overall a very polished and satisfying game."
62,2659,"My favorite puzzle game. It's not so hard that you keep bashing your head against the wall, and it's not so easy that you just waltz through each level. It's perfectly balanced."
63,2659,An incredible engineering puzzle game set in a fun world and storyline. The puzzles will delight and confound you for hours.
64,2658,The typical Zachtronics formula and typical Zachtronics quality. Puzzles are great. Polish and atmosphere are great.
65,2657,"When I solve a hard puzzle, it feels goodBut then I look up how other people did itand it feels bad10/10"
66,2657,This game features great puzzles and with its various block mechanics it gives you freedom to solve these puzzles in your way.  There is not a single solution.  It's fun to learn as you go and then go back to previous levels and make more effecient solutions too.
67,2656,Another great Zachtronic.
68,2656,Some levels can be difficult. But feel game gets easier as it gives you more tools. You can partially complete a chapter and use tools from newer chapters in the old ones. Leader-boards really makes you thrive for an efficient machine. Would definitely recommend.
69,2655,Great puzzle game to work through with out being stressed out over a timer.   As a parent I appreciate a game I can walk (run) away from as needed that won't ruin my progress.
70,2655,"Love it. Challenging, yet rewarding!"
71,2655,Fun puzzle game. Refining solutions is more interesting than solving them the first time
72,2654,"Organizing blocks into arbitrary shapes is fun.This game uses local backups for your save, so if your computer happens to crash when you're on the final puzzle and you find that steam cloud has a brand new save to overwrite all your progress with, you can remember this comment and not ragequit. I kind of got invested in this game so I am so, so happy I don't have to start all over!"
73,2653,first person factorio!
74,2653,its cool to start with an idea and evolve it into multiple functioning parts that all work together.
75,2653,I always wanted to work in a factory.
76,2653,zor
77,2652,Tee hee big machine make shape
78,2652,good
79,2651,"If you take nothing else from the reviews, learn this. You can push wires into other wires with pistons. This is essential for logic gates in endgame missions. See if you can figure out how to do an on/off switch because I certainly can't."
80,2650,I keep coming back for this game for years now
81,2650,it's great
82,2648,"Great puzzle game, took me 16 hours to beat all the levels (EDIT: There's actually a bonus campaign! Even more content than I thought!). Kinda similar to doing redstone stuff in minecraft. Very fun and satisfying. Worth the price in my opinion."
83,2647,uh
84,2647,The Factory must grow more efficient
85,2647,This game is a series of little self-contained puzzles using different types of 3d blocks. I give it an 8/10.
86,2645,I find it quite satisfying to build a factory that works.  Some of the puzzles are quite difficult.  The different things you discover in the landscape are interesting.
87,2645,"I enjoyed building all sorts of Doomsday weapons, and machines of War for my Alien Overlords.  They treated me with Delicious food pellets of the utmost flavor.  I will never ever say NO to there endless Alien generosity.  All the other dead Humans just didn't appreciate the lengths our Alien Overlords went to gives us our comfy living accommodations.  No bad words about our Alien Overlords will be tolerated for they are good and just.I would Recommend forever and a Day into serving our Alien Overlords..."
88,2642,factory goes brrrrr
89,2642,"It's like SpaceChem, but in three dimensions. If you like Zachtronics games, you'll like this one.If you haven't played one of these yet, I'd start with Opus Magnum."
90,2640,One of the most fun puzzle games I played.It can get fairly hard though.
91,2640,"$850,000 / $1,000,000-------------------------Fun puzzle game that has interesting mechanics and has a nice difficulty curve."
92,2639,"Zachtronics makes a whole lot of cool games, but the 3d puzzles mean this is probably my favourite."
93,2639,"Rating: FantasticSolve puzzles by building machines out of blocks. On ""success"", get presented with stats showing you just how badly your solution sucks compared to others. Obsessively optimize your creation block-by-block until you realize it's tomorrow.Great mechanics, clean visuals, and reasonable controls."
94,2639,"While I don't recommend, it's because I feel like most people who get this will want to beat the game, even if they don't optimize. The game is good, I can't say otherwise, but I've played 3 Zachtronics games, Spacechem, Opus Magnum, and this. This was by far the hardest one I'd say. The final chapter difficulty spike is HUGE. Beyond anything in Spacechem, and harder than the Post-game of Opus Magnum. The ""final chapter"" of Opus was by far the easiest though, and the post-game offers no achievements so even the devs didn't seem to expect you to be too concerned by it.The main thing that makes this game so much harder is that you don't go at your own pace. You have an input adjustment, but without some very messy effort on your end, you're always at the whims of how fast the game gives you objects. And in the final chapter, the objects you are expected to make just don't allow for you to mess around with how you're fed objects. And while some of the chapters right before the final one were hard, the spike in difficulty is just... huge. It's too big, really. It turns what was extremely fun to figure out into pure tedium.It borders on rediculousness. But if extremely hard puzzles are your thing, this is actually right for you. If you want a hard puzzle game that feels a bit more fair, go for Spacechem. For as hard as that one gets, it was my favorite of the three games."
95,2639,"A pretty decent while ago I picked this up, and at the time didn't get into it - it felt too puzzly at first. Played a lot of Factorio instead and decided to come back to this after that and oh boy, did this turn out to be a gem. Absolutely addictive as soon as you get past the intro levels. Makes me wish I pulled through when I initially got it.You're building factory systems, and just like in Factorio with getting some beautiful ratio setups, it's as satisfying as solving a (complex) math equation. The fact that you get a direct performance review after completing is stimulating rather than daunting, and the overall world building with the aliens giving you food pellets and nonsensical performance reviews works great to set the tone.If you love logic / logistics and are partial to puzzles this is a must-get. Any Zachtronics game is, really."
96,2639,"Zachtronics puts out the best games.  After playing Spacechem back when it first came out, I've always kept my eyes open for more.  This one is another of my favorites.  The levels are well designed, with a constantly increasing difficulty until you feel like it's time to give up.  But you push through, learn tricks, and keep moving forward.  I still prefer the darkish humor in Spacechem, but this one also got several good laughs."
97,2638,"just straight up hard puzzles, it's great"
98,2636,
99,2636,A frustratingly good puzzle game like this makes the hours fly by before you realize you're starving and have a headache from lack of sleep.
100,2636,"Great game for finding _a_ solution, not _the_ solution. Each time you solve a puzzle, it feels unique, like you discovered your own path, not something the developers intended. Highly recommend."
101,2635,This game is a mix between Factorio and Minecraft.Although similar to Factorio its mechanics are very different.In general it is pretty challenging.Highly recommended to everyone who likes Factorio-like games.
102,2635,"A fun Experience, definitely challenging!"
103,2635,Very cool blocky factories.
104,2635,This one is fun. I can't seem to move stuff around right.
105,2634,game hard :(
106,2634,"For me, the best puzzle game ever made.If you're a programmer, you MUST try this game. So much fun to try to optimise your solution three different ways - for footprint, for cycles or for blocks."
107,2633,"nice, challenging, and relaxing"
108,2633,This game is worth playing for anyone who is even remotely interested in problem solving.
109,2632,It's like if minecraft was actually about the pistons and redstone contraptions
110,2632,gOOD
111,2632,"Very nice game, the interesting bit it that me and friends seem to have very different tactics of solving the puzzles.Some optimise on units, some on steps some on floorspace . . very interesting imo."
112,2631,"Infinifactory is the easily best puzzle game I ever played!It can be highly recommended to anyone who's into building, engineering, algorithms etc.The game is made in visual style that's very appealing to the eye.And, oh man, what an awesome feeling watching these conveyors finally working as planned, you almost feel you can watch this forever =)"
113,2631,vary good pusal game
114,2631,3D programming
115,2631,I like this game.
116,2631,it's a fun game!
117,2630,"Very relaxing.I mean, there isn't a whole lot else to say about it, it's just a really chill puzzle game about building an automated factory line for a bunch of aliens too lazy to do it themselves.Floyd is a chad."
118,2629,"Amazing, wonderful game. Please Please Please port this to VR. I have a Oculus Rift S and would pay $ to play this in VR."
119,2628,Solid puzzle game.
120,2627,"Excellent intro into Zachtronics. If you're at all interested check it out, worth every penny."
121,2627,"A puzzle game where being at least somewhat smart is needed. No randomness and the high score (""low score""?) system that lets you optimize your solution on three different aspects shines and ups the replayability."
122,2627,It's brilliant!
123,2626,One of the best logical problem solving games i've played
124,2626,The best way to flex how autistic you are.Its spacechem in 3d
125,2626,Nice relaxing puzzle game. Trying to optimize solutions is very satisfying.
126,2626,"The back story is funny, the puzzles are fun and addicting, the user interface is polished and minimal. Im somewhere in the middle, and I dont want it to end. 10/10"
127,2625,"it's a fun and challenging game that really makes you think, it's puzzling but not rage-quit difficult which is nice"
128,2625,"Spend an hour on a solution only to discover you miscounted the number of blocks in one of the segments and have to start over from scratch. A+++, 10/10"
129,2624,This game is a very good puzzle and strategy game that is very hard.
130,2624,amazing builder puzzle game
131,2624,"Minecraft for machine-building puzzles.  No pressure, fun, good sense of humor."
132,2623,"Engaging puzzles to solve in an environment that I find attractive and enjoyable. Intuitive controls, a well thought out set of tools, etc."
133,2622,"Has that awesome trademark Zachtronics feel of ""Go ahead and build the ugliest, most inefficient machine ever created; it just has to work. If you want to build a better one, though, go ahead and crazy with it. It's all in your hands."""
134,2622,"3D maths. As with all Zachtronics games, you might feel like you're doing homework, but it's generally pretty fun when you're not frustrated and being reminded that you're not that smart."
135,2622,Fantastic puzzles. Iterative design. Tongue-in-cheek story. The later levels involve a high volume of pieces and become a bit of a chore. Hours of fantastic fun!Four stars (of Five).
136,2622,its great
137,2622,reminds me of satisfactory except that game came later >:|
138,2622,"If you love programming/machine building/toubleshooting/puzzle games, this is a must have."
139,2621,An excellent puzzle game with truly open ended solutions. Even if you look up other people's solutions you're inspired not to duplicate their exact construction but use their ideas and improve on them and try to better them with your own ideas. An absolute blast.
140,2621,Very good game
141,2621,The puzzles are really challenging and fun but without seeming impossible. There are so many possibilities to go about each problem! 10/10
142,2620,"Great Zachtronics title. Easier than Spacechem because the extra dimension gives you more freedom, but on the flipside also lets you create more creative (read: hacky) solutions which is very fun. Much easier to explain my solutions to my wife than with Spacechem too."
143,2620,magnum opus is prettier but i find this one more satisfying personally
144,2620,This game is one of my favorites. I keep coming back.
145,2620,Calming puzzle minecraft essentially. Unbelievably satisfying.
146,2620,good
147,2619,"It can be good or bad for your brain, but I Love it!"
148,2619,"This game is so generous. When you think you're there it hits you with much much more.It's basically Minecraft as a puzzle game with a story. It's really good, I love it, and I recommend it.However the puzzles can get quite intense so it's not for everyone. It gets hard at times.But always so rewarding when you get it !"
149,2619,Absolutely brilliant time waster.  Love it!
150,2619,It's a lot of fun
151,2618,"Great game for working the grey matter, keeps me entertained for hours"
152,2618,"A big BUT when I say I love this game.   here is the BUT...  The one thing that bugs the crap out of me is that you cannot reset your game / progress other than by going in and editing the save.dat file .  there are many reasons people need this feature that every other game like this has.. or at least add profiles so that people can select the profile they want to play on.  that is a HUGE BAD Mark!   Other than that, it's humorous, good challenge and you can get as ocd as possible or not for better stats.  I like how you can look at your friend's progress and scores as well."
153,2617,"I can spend hours playing this game. I enjoy the time spent considering how to break apart each problem into smaller chunks, and whether they will fit together into a final solution. Then implementing and testing each chunk of work and slowly seeing the overall solution form. It is very satisfying once a solution is worked out, to see all of the inputs pass through the work flow and then output correctly."
154,2615,Makes me feel like I've got a huge brain when I figure out a solution
155,2615,"Infinifactory is a programming-like conveyor-belt/factory type game where it doesn't matter what your solution looks like, only if it works. Like all Zachtronics games, it starts off hard and gets so hard you will lose days of your life just trying to debug your solution. It's infuriating and I loved every minute of it. On a scale of Opus Magnum to Space Chem, it's definitely in between. You can expand your solution into three dimensions if you need it, so it's not so limiting as Space Chem, but the jetpack you fly around on will automatically return you if you drift too far from your work area, so it's not infinite like Opus Magnum. Like with other Zachtronics games, it's not about getting the solution right, but getting it right consistently (like a smooth-running factory), so you have to make 10 of a thing to count as a success. There are also achievements you can work toward and optimizations, like using fewer blocks, less square footage, or fewer number of cycles to reach your solution, so there is replayability. There are new mechanics introduced every few stages (antigrav lifts, switches, drills, etc.) so there's a great variety of tools so you can solve puzzles a variety of ways.As for the story--yes, there is actually a story! You have been abducted by alien overlords who are forcing you to build things like weapons, shields, and even ""meat products"" for them. You find out about the world first through audio logs and then...well, you'll just have to play.I played for over a hundred hours to beat this game and made whale patties. 10/10"
156,2615,"This is no doubt the best puzzle game I've ever played.1. Controls are intuitive for anyone who has played Minecraft. 2. You gradually learn new tools and how they interact with each other.3. Complexity of the simplest working solution increases steadily from level to level.4. Instead of having only one correct solution to a level that either works or it doesn't you get Minecraft-like freedom to build any crazy machine you want and if it produces the right outputs, you get to compare its speed(cycles), size(footprint) and cost(blocks) to those submitted by other players (and of course improve it until you feel really smart =)6. Good graphics and interesting gradual reveal of the world through messages left by long-dead puzzle solvers. 5.

Overall a great game for this genre.  My one critique is it is not super polished: the graphics and limited interaction with other characters look and feel about 20 years old. Not a dealbreaker since the game is really about the puzzles."

204,2607,"Initially bought this thinking it was a buildcraft clone- boy was I in for a ride. I'm still completing it, because it is rather difficult- but never to a frustrating degree. The puzzles make you feel smart when you complete them, and there is no compare to the utterly orgasmic feeling you get when you just stand back and watch your factory work. Top tier puzzle game, i would reccomend it to anyone who is willing to sacrifice all their free thoughts to hypothetical solutions to the thing you were working on last."
205,2607,"You have to enjoy puzzling out the details of increasingly complex assembly lines, but apparently I do because I enjoyed every minute of it.   There is also the attraction of trying to find the most efficient process.  Not for everybody but great fun for those who do enjoy such puzzles."

213,2603,"This puzzle game gets pretty addictive pretty fast. The game is about matching specific shapes and types of materials with the outputs given. It is fun to experiment with different ways to go about splitting outputs or slowing them down, and can even sometimes lead you into a little off-task rabbit hole! I would definitely recommend this to anyone, especially ones who like challenging puzzles or just things like minecraft ""redston-ing."""
214,2603,very good game :)
215,2603,"Zachtronics with another one. The ennui of victory on a harder puzzle (that subsequently looks good on the histogram :P) feels better than the hardest of Dark Souls challenge runs. It's close to being better than sex, but takes more effort."
216,2603,10/10Really fantastic puzzle game. This company scratches the itch over and over again.
217,2603,Really great puzzle game
218,2603,Fun
219,2603,"I'll admit that I've not played a whole lot of Infinifactory, more recent Zachtronics titles tend to attract my interest over this relatively older title. Still, though, you can tell just from the first hour or so that this game is pulling no punches. It contains the same brain-busting puzzles you've come to expect from Zachtronics, lightly seasoned with plot where appropriate.I wonder if Zachtronics will ever venture back to the 3D realm? Only time will tell."
220,2602,"The nine hours of playtime is spread out over multiple attempts to cope with the game. Unfortunately, while the first person view is merely annoying, the guard-rail-free platforms floating in an endless sky renders it unplayable. Turns out that it's really hard to concentrate on the puzzles when you're fighting off a phobia attack and distracted by having to constantly check how close to the edge you are. It would be one thing if it were part of the gameplay mechanics, but it's a purely aesthetic choice and, thus, gratuitous."
221,2602,"Infinifactory is a very interesting game. The factory building itself is amazing, and the storyline is very interesting as well, presenting an amazing game."
222,2602,A polished logistics puzzler.  I'm going to lose so many hours to this thing.
223,2602,Probably my favorite game ever.
224,2601,Sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo addicting
225,2601,"If you like puzzle games and problem solving. It's a nice relaxing game, no time limits, just build an assembly line/factory that produces the demanded blocks in the demanded configuration. The building is voxel based, snap and rotate. It can get a little overwhelming and 'chory' sometimes, but it's quite satisfactory to try and optimize and make it as simple as possible. I give it a 4 out of 6. It's fun, but not amazing."
226,2601,"In short: Good but not as good as Opus Magnum. The theme and story carry this particular game. And for their first 3D Programming game they did a good enough job with it. Let's skip to the problem: The main difficulty you will encounter is path length. There is no way to construct some sort of ""if then else"" function aside from a button that is triggered by objects passing by. But this thing is not enough for most solutions as you would normally want to do stuff like: while this space is occupied do this. But you can only trigger it while its passing in motion or else the lever that pushes your cubes around will be stuck. So really all you can do to synchronize your solution is to make the paths differently long and this is where it gets fiddly. I personally are currently stuck on a puzzle that has 1 cube generator and 1 shredder that makes them into different shapes. The result needs to be 6 cubes in triangle shape and 4 cubes normal. You see whats gonna happen right? Even if I make a solution that works for the first 1 or 2 iterations since I have to devide them un evenly and I can't tell the source to stop spawning the solution will desync eventually and that is exactly what happened. All I can do then is make the path 1 longer or shorter until it works for 10 entire iterations and this is a really tedious process. Opus Magnum didn't have a way for If selection either but the pathing in that game was way better since you had infinite space to build your machine. Infinifactory (ironically) doesn't have infinite space. Infact the topology of the level is often a problem in itself. Still recommend it since playing is still fun and the story is interesting. But the actual puzzles are really aweful to get to run properly later on."
227,2601,Fun and addictive puzzle game where you dynamically set your own difficulty
228,2601,Seemingly simple set of tools with a simple set of rules yet game play is sophisticated and quickly can combine simple tools to create more complex systems. Great Zachtronics game.
229,2600,"It's a Zachtronics game, of course you should play it. Prepare to have your brain turn into butter"
230,2600,I enjoy the entertaining puzzles so far
231,2600,"A relaxing yet engaging game. It gives you much less adrenaline than a shooter. The humor is excellent and black. The comlexity grows a lot when further into the game. There are good examples of solutions on youtube, so that helps."
232,2599,"this game is a lot of fun but i try to avoid looking at other peoples' solutions because mine look like straight garbage compared to the mastery others have at this game. but hey, a solution is a solution. if you're really smart/good at the game you can optimize for different variables, but you can also just try to get something together that works.the later levels are really difficult, at least for me. some of these still don't make much sense to me (haven't beaten everything yet) and it does feel like there should be some sort of mechanic that i'm missing at this point. but that's probably due to my lack of knowledge in things like programming and algorithms or whatever kind of stuff helps in a game like this.definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a difficult game that rewards your creative thinking and gives you immense satisfaction with each completed puzzle."
233,2599,"Quite a fun experience, especially during the first levels where you learn all the new stuff. In the later levels you still learn some new blocks and strategies, but the later levels can be tedious at times because of the huge structures you need to craft or because you've made a minor mistake which forces you to redesign your whole structure. Still quite fun and you can always skip a level it it annoys you too much."
234,2599,my brain is pulsating
235,2599,Puzzles about spatial reasoning and timing. They get tough! Seeing the metrics distribution of other players' (and your friend on Steam) can be a great motivator.
236,2599,Amazing game.
237,2597,very good game but messy through the end
238,2596,"Infinifactory is a great puzzle game, and will appeal most strongly to those who enjoy task-oriented problem solving and optimisation.Without question, this is a much improved problem solver when compared with SpaceChem.  The environment is much more immersive and the story also adds colour and some incentive to continued level completion.After a break of a couple years, I have discovered a new enjoyment in revisiting my past solutions and attempting to improve upon previous block and cycle counts.  For some solutions, I have marvelled alternately at the brilliance and utter stupidity of my forgotten solutions to these levels.  In my assessment, the ability to easily contemplate solution fitness is a quite rare feature among modern games, and on this basis I would strongly recommend to students and practitioners of computer science, software engineering and other engineering disciplines."
239,2595,"Times like this, I wish Steam allowed you to say something other than ""Recommend"" or ""Don't Recommend"". I want to put my answer somewhere in-between.If you enjoy slamming your head into the wall until you find a solution, this game is for you.For about 50 hours (as shown by my time played), I did enjoy that. The earlier levels are pretty trivial, though it's fun trying to optimize solutions. As the levels got more difficult, I had fun trying to find a way past the limitations.On the final few levels, however, that effort became a chore. I felt as if the developers were _artificially_ increasing the difficulty by giving dumb, unnecessary constraints, like only providing a painter one block high when two blocks would have made the solution simple. By the in-game story, such a constraint makes literally no sense.The last straw was on the very last level of the game, where I spent several hours coming up with a solution that would finally get all the pieces in the right place to build this massive object, only to find out that two blocks which I _couldn't even see_ at the target location were missing, thus negating my entire solution. I would have had to start at least half of it from scratch, possibly all of it, due to the space limitations of the level.Part of this may be the inherent drawbacks of a 3D puzzle game like this. I don't know for sure. All I know is that I got to the final level, and I feel cheated enough by the devs that I'm not going to put in the extra few hours to fix my solution and finish the last level. I'm done."
240,2594,Good game.
241,2593,Brilliant level/puzzle design that allows for problem solving with creativity. The setting/story is also fun and intriguing. And there is quite a lot of content. There is many ways to solve each level and each one offers new and unique challenges.
242,2591,"Very good for puzzle fans but it crashes quite a lot (right now I can't even restart the game, gonna need to reboot). Besides that it's a lot of fun!"
243,2590,"This is an amazing game, I almost feel like it's in a genre of it's own.  (I know that's not objectively true, but it feels true)  It has a story which is actually pretty good!  most puzzle games don't need a story and they are fine, this game doesn't need a story to be good but it has one which is pretty engrossing.  Idk what to say, I love it.  If you like puzzle games, you'll like this game.  Worth the full price."
244,2589,i got a chicken
245,2588,"This game is difficult, but rewarding and fun. Makes me feel smart when I solve things, dumb when I can't.  I'm not far along but am already starting to struggle mighaly to find solutions."
246,2587,"Puzzles with multiple solutions. Recommend the user focus on solving the puzzle, then look for ways to make it more efficient.  Just like life, expect to start over now and them.   Just like programming, sometimes it is better to just start over.  For difficult puzzles, break them into small steps by building part of the solution, rather than bring it all together at once. Highly recommend for teaching problem solving skills."
247,2587,"a wonderful first person puzzle game, bring your best mindset or you'll be infuriated when nothing works the first time"
248,2585,The farthest i've gotten in a zachtronics game while still providing a fun challenge
249,2584,"This is a very good quality factorty building game. I feel like I'm solving math problems but with very big variety of solutions available. Normally I am supossed to solve a problem at least in 3 ways to score good at 3 different aspects we are getting scored for but I am too lazy to do that so I am trying to find best solution I could and then I'm moving on :D at first I was not able to score better than avarage of players but as time passed, I became able to pass the avarage score at one or sometimes two different aspects with only one solution. The improvement I feel and the feeling of being proud of the work I've done is what makes me want to play this game more. 10/10 would recommend to anyone who likes to solve puzzles or problems."
250,2584,"A fantastic puzzle game where you build voxel space factories while under the watchful eye of alien overlords. Using simple tools and trial and error, you build complex machines capable of transforming components into products. It's a lax experience that's easy to dive into, but challenging to master. It's extremely accessible, and provides a welcome playground for experimentation and critical thinking. While it may look intimidating, it's actually very engaging.Infinifactory follows the tale of a human, specifically you, that has been abducted by mentally-inept alien overlords. Outfitted with a space suit and a set of tools, you're put to work creating various automated production lines. You'll produce everything from structural supports, satellites, shuttles, tanks, and even agricultural products. In the beginning, you have basic metal blocks for support, and conveyors for moving items around. As you progress, you gain extra tools such as welders, pistons, sensors, and rotators. Each new tool is quite simple on the surface, but can exhibit a surprising amount of variant behaviours. As you learn and improve your methods, you begin to discover profound interactions between tools, which leads to you creating complicated symphonies of parts working together to systematically assemble a complex component.For example, using structural blocks with welders can create welding lines for assembling metal beams. Using pistons, conveyors, and a sensor with a free floating structural block can be used as a timer or a counter. Using pistons or rotators with a free floating welder can be used like a robo-welding arm or spot welder. Using lifters and blockers with a string of vertical welders can be operated as a sort of mold-press for a large frame component. I realize that most of that sounds like gibberish to the uninitiated, but it's quite easy to follow once you've become familiar with the game and its tools.In that vein, the game is actually quite easy to pick up and play. Early levels ease you in with limited options and very simple inputs. Every concept in the game is taught visually, by showing and doing, rather than telling or explaining. The game nudges you along, showing you brief glimpses of more complex designs, usually illustrated on some billboard or info panel. Each puzzle throws in a slight variation or relatively small addition to push you out of your comfort zone, but never to the point of overwhelming you. Even the later levels do a pretty good job of only introducing one new issue at a time, rather than railroading you with a daunting task.Despite having a reasonably large selection of tools at your disposal, it never feels like any of them are underused. Each tool is carefully crafted to always play a role in whatever you are building. It would have been easy to bloat the experience with too much choice, but here there is restraint. Even late game, when potential upgrades to existing tools are introduced, they never outshine the original versions. Honestly, such careful balance is rather impressive from a game design perspective.Another marvelous aspect to Infinifactory is the ability to tease out creative and critical thinking. Having played SpaceChem beforehand, I was a bit worried that this would go down the same path. SpaceChem was simple at first, but ultimately brutal in its difficulty curve. The limitation of 2D, the split nature of having multiple puzzle areas connecting to each other, and the fact that you were punished for every collision made SpaceChem a headache at times. I was enthusiastic about the problem solving aspect of SpaceChem, but not the ""instant fail state for every mistake"" style of gameplay.Here, however, is where Infinifactory shines. The space used for building your factory is very lax and open. Just solve the puzzle in the most efficient, complex, minimal, or convoluted way you please. As long as the input becomes the output and leaves the level, you're all good. It's this gentle trial and error environment that makes Infinifactory much more accessible and enjoyable, fostering both creative and critical thinking, rather than restraining it.You see your input, your output, and your tools, and begin work by just trying something. You break the problem down. You focus on one piece at a time. You test. You iterate. You tweak. Eventually, everything seems to fall into place. You step back and watch your factory move, in an almost poetic fashion, as it busily snaps together the requested output. All the while you're thinking, ""Wow, I can't believe I made this.""This even lends itself well in terms of replayability. After each completed puzzle, you're given a score based on speed, size, and the number of blocks used. This is a sort of high score, but very vague and based primarily on brackets rather than individual players. Instead of feeling a sigh of relief for finishing, you dive back in and try to tweak your system to improve your score. I have never been a fan of a scoreboards in games, but this particular aspect made it enthralling rather than frustrating.It may sound like work, but it's actually quite hypnotic. I haven't really binged a game like this in a long time, but Infinifactory would grab hold of my attention and not let go.I did have one issue with the game, but its mostly subjective. For the most part, the game is a work of art, but it occasionally fails to inform the player of critical game knowledge. The first half of the game is pretty smooth, but the second half relies a bit too much on knowing specific strategies to win. In multiple levels near the end, I wasted several hours or even days trying to solve a puzzle without knowing the gimmick. I'd have frequent restarts after hours of work, or large stretches of no progress at all. One level in particular introduced a new block that was never announced, and I ended up building a complicated 500 block punch card machine that ran on a variable timer. I had to look up hints online for a few of the last ones, as a reasonable solution required some technique I hadn't discovered yet.Of course, it's worth noting that the second half of the game came as free DLC after the fact, so there was likely a nice window of time between the first and second halves, where players toned up their factory making skills in the internum. Going into the second half of the game immediately feels a bit difficulty dissonant when you're still a relative newcomer to the game.In conclusion, Infinifactory is an amazing masterpiece of game design engineering. It fosters thinking and problem solving, while also being captivating and rewarding. It's very accessible and easy to learn, teaching through visuals and trial and error. Its puzzles are playgrounds for experimentation and creativity. It may look daunting, but it's actually relaxing and engaging. Perhaps you never thought you'd be able to build something so marvelously complex, yet soberingly poetic. Well, maybe now you can.Steam Curator"
251,2583,great game with some hard ass puzzles. ive been stuck on one puzzle for at least two hours. while i love this game and how hard it is i would wait for the sale to buy it as $20 is kinda alot for some funky puzzle games
252,2583,a bit different as to how i first expected but get it on a sale
253,2583,"Infinifactory: in which you build what amounts to assembly lines for constructing various artefacts, ranging from a satellite to a small, moderately well furnished apartment. The catch? You're doing this for a bunch of space aliens. They abduct you right at the beginning. Nope, you never learn their language, nor they yours. You're basically a slave.It blends very well the industrial feel of Factorio (machines, materials processing, thousands of conveyor belts) with the mechanics of Big Pharma (alter and/or combine stuff from A and B, get it to C) and the world-navigation of Minecraft (~1m 3D blocks, no part limit, endless flying around, mouse click to place or remove).It's an excellent combination; despite not knowing if my abductors were fundamentally honourable or not, or even what they wanted all this stuff for (though the 'javelins' were pretty obvious), I found myself wanting to make the best damn solution I could, every time. Instead of solving each puzzle as soon as I could and moving on to bigger and better things, I spent ages optimising all my designs until they ran sweet as a nut.The best way to do it is to build it bit by bit, and see what happens during each stage of the manufacturing process, improving as you go until the final product is ready. However, I derived immense satisfaction from building the whole thing in one go, working it out in my head, then starting it all up and watching everything click perfectly into place. That method hardly ever works, though.If, like me, this was all you were expecting from a game literally describing itself as an infinite factory, then you may be surprised. This game is at least a little deeper than it looks. If you're the sensitive type, watch out for Training Routine 5.I haven't finished this game yet - that's true for most of my games, actually - but if you really like factories in general and Factorio in particular, and really wished that it was in full 3D; then you should probably play Satisfactory instead. That is, unless you prefer a large number of small puzzles to one sprawling, continuous puzzle, and you really really like being by yourself.Seeing as the space aliens have you in a cell for the majority of your stay with them, there is no possibility of cooperating with anyone at all. There's a little more info on that in level Optical Sensor Array Type 4.Compatibility? This game should work fine for anyone. If my ancient computer with its 2008 motherboard can run it, then so can yours.I'd keep going, but I really need to get back to work. These machines aren't going to make themselv- oh wait."
254,2583,Great puzzles. Long life time.
255,2583,its a fun problem solving game to play
256,2583,"This should be improved.    O O O    3 Seperate Boxes on 3 conveyor belts. ""<-"" should be won.   -> <-<-"
257,2583,"What shall I say? It's zach-like. If you love Zach's games, you love'll this one."
258,2583,Another wonderful logic game from Zachtronics.
259,2583,Awesome puzzle game that makes me feel like an Armenian Puzzle god and a total idiot all at once. It combines spacial and timing puzzles all into one providing a very satisfying sense of pride when you do finally figure the puzzle out despite it being an over engineered mess.
260,2583,"If you are a programmer already, you probably don't want this. It's glorified algorithm design. Yes there are some clever solutions to problems with regards the physics, but it's a puzzle game where you spend most of your time planning a solution and doing not much. Getting a solution often isn't difficult, but requires placing many blocks and isn't too rewarding."
261,2583,"Fun challenging, gameplay that feels good when you solve a puzzle. My main issue is some of the puzzle are so large and complex that they can be daunting to work on and troubleshoot. All in all an excellent puzzle game."
262,2583,"Should've bought it years ago, fantastic game."
263,2583,"I'm only part way through the game but definitely recommend it. It's like SpaceChem (which may be obvious), but in 3D."
264,2583,Great game. Feels a bit like Factorio but with puzzles.
265,2583,"Brilliant little puzzle game, highly recommend."
266,2583,Really makes you think in different ways and recall from what you've learned. Very fun
267,2583,"This was a fun little game. if you're looking to make a factory in a sandbox environment, this isn't what you're looking for. It's a challenging logic puzzle. the first map was even one that made me think."
268,2583,"If you like SpaceChem you will like this, probably. Maybe even if you don't. I can't get enough."
269,2583,wow! a fantastic game for those who feels a sense of achievement in providing some great solutions. Reallyit makes me think a lot even when im not playing :) and i love it

272,2582,good game
273,2582,"It's a pretty solid puzzle game, and it's definitely worth getting especially if you're already a fan of Zachatronic's games."
274,2582,love it
275,2582,"8 / 10, Would recommend. Good puzzle game.It  is was easy"
276,2582,A great sandbox puzle game. Interesting challenges where you are free to make your own solution and see how it compairs to other players.
277,2582,"I was unsure about this game when I bought it, but its actually really fun and challenging."
278,2582,"A thoroughly enjoyable strategy logic puzzle game, where the aim is to create a production queue that builds and ships objects from some core components. There is a story line about bureaucratic aliens who've abducted you (similar to the Vogons from Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy) to essentially be slave labour and a rebellion of the enslaved workers. It's a nice addition to what is essentially a clever puzzle game.It has good replay value due to wanting to create better solutions, either to compete with the Online Avg. from other Players or trying to achieve the bonus challenges, which both become quite difficult in the second campaign.The only downside I'd say is that both Campaigns are a little short, and it'd be good to see some additional campaigns.And because it's so short, the difficult ramps up a little quickly after being fairly simply for the first half the game while you're learning. Some better pacing with getting a new Tool to work with, then a few Puzzles (Missions) that focus on that gradually increasing in difficulty with a Final Mission for each Set using all 2-3 Tools you unlock during such would've probably have been better... same with the story; it's not well paced, and somewhat ramps up quickly over a couple of missions rather than the 20 or so you have before hand.Overall I'd definately recommend this as a Chill Out Game, if you're more into (or just enjoy) the challenge of a puzzle rather than non-stop action."
279,2582,SERVE THY OVERLORD
280,2582,Really fun game to wait for server loading on other games :p
281,2582,"this game is so damn hard jeez man how is a brainlet like me ever supposed to finish this, i literally had trouble getting past the tutorial"
282,2582,Great game for testing your mind and capacity to solve problems.
283,2582,if you like sandbox puzzle games  that make you think than this is the game for you! love this game very fun spent hrs playing this game
284,2582,"Reminiscent of Codex of Alchemical Engineering, but in 3D.Most of the puzzles are solvable through brute force but doing so is still a treat. Watching your solutions play out is very rewarding, and immediately makes you think of ways to improve your build."
285,2582,Great Brain Teaser Highly recommend
286,2582,Brain excersices over an awesome game.
287,2582,"Like Minecraft Redstone: puzzle mode, but the mouse buttons are reversed. I should probably rebind that..."
288,2582,Tremendous amount of fun. Some really challenging and rewarding puzzles.
289,2582,"It's games like these that made me want to become an engineer. I personally love taking the time to make the ridiculous factories you need to complete the levels, but I feel you really need to enjoy the spacial understanding required and the, testing/troubleshooting needed to make a functional factory. If you do though, the game is almost one-of-a-kind.I'd say the shortcomings are that it can become a little stale/boring as the levels get longer, which could make the time investment not worth it to some. Additionally, the story is a little bit predictable. Without risking any spoilers, once you've played it, you'll realize exactly what game the story feels like it's copying."
290,2582,Very fun and challenging
291,2582,"At first I quite enjoyed the puzzles but it seems the difficulty just fluctuates too much. Spending an hour on building and testing a contraption just to be forced to delete it again and start from scratch is not a sign of clever puzzle building, it's just repetitive and ultimately very boring and frustrating. I also felt like I was missing basic tools to provide satisfactory results earlier on in the game. I dislike the way you have no control over the factory once it is up and running.The building phase isn't exactly fun as the only way to test your contraption is to start the factory. Some sort of simulation-as-you-build or a hint system would have been nice to get things moving along when you're stuck. I'm not entirely sure why I dislike these puzzles. I enjoyed Portal 1 and 2, for example and I think it has to do with being almost immediately rewarded or at least being able to somewhat have a clue of what to do and thus being able to set a goal  and notice progress each step of the way in the aforementioned games. In Infinifactory you can spend all day looking at a puzzle and not come one iota closer to solving it. Experiments, unlike in Portal where you're flying around and actually part of the puzzle, aren't intuitive, they're not playful and you're just not a part of them either. I also didn't quite get the fascination with suffering and death for such a light-hearted title. The humor seems to be in stark contrast to the rather playful theme and does not fit. This, however, didn't really stop me from playing but it didn't make the game any more fun either. Perhaps the puzzles were just too difficult for me. I did not look a single one of them up as I don't want to have one of those 'I never could have figured that one out' moments. I don't play games to be reminded of how dumb I am, you know. So your mile-age may vary. I tried some other games by the same developer and I was never too impressed. Maybe these games are more for people who like to think their way out of a situation and mull things over before setting their plan in motion. I prefer getting to work and adapt to the situation on the fly. This game definitely does not feature that kind of problem-solving."
292,2582,An interesting puzzler
293,2582,"What a cool puzzle game. The levels really get you to think, pretty neat"
294,2582,"Nice puzzle game, feels like not as complex 3 d version of spacechem."
295,2582,"Reminds me a lot of portal. Good puzzles in the foreground, Cool lore in the background. Like some kind of amazing mullet."
296,2582,good
297,2582,"Great little puzzle game, though after a while it makes you question your morals...GET THIS GAME!"
298,2582,"It's neat. But so far it's much more of a puzzle game than it is a factory simulation. That's something worth knowing before going in, if, like me, you were expecting something a bit more like Factorio or Production Line.Also, the attempt at a ""kind of unsettling sci-fi plot"" is unnecessary and unimpressive."
299,2582,"I didn't expect there to be lore and an actual story in what is effectively just a puzzle game, but... I was pleasantly surprised."
300,2582,Great.  Allows for creative solutions with interesting puzzle pieces.
301,2582,The difficulty makes it very fun and it is nice gaem to play.
302,2582,very good
303,2582,"I wasn't sure if Zachtronics could move their challenging ""factory"" puzzle games in 3D, but I was very pleasantly surprised  to see that the could and did in Infinitfactory.  The gameplay is the normal Zachtronics puzzle solving, but the 3D interface you use to solve them is easy and fun to use."
304,2582,"I'd like my brain back, please. This is one of those ""oh, too easy,"" games where you end up spending literally all night on one puzzle.Ah, but finally making it work is soooo satisfying.""I'll just peak at the next one, so I can think about it. I'll play it tomorrow.""""Hmm, wait, this looks easy, maybe I'll just solve it real quick...""Rinse. Repeat."
305,2582,"Great puzzle game!I am having fun optimizing production lines on 3 points: Cycle, Footprint and Block count.Classic logic puzzle by Zachtronics. Keep up the awesome work!"
306,2582,"A welcome challenge for yourself, depending on your sense of perfect the game scales dynamicly. if you enjoy a good puzzle this could be one th check out"
307,2582,A surprisingly fun puzzle game with a good difficulty curve. Interesting little story that I wasn't prepared for. I recommend it to fans of puzzle games who want a difficult but fair experience.
308,2582,"Puzzles become quiclky complex, you'll need to be able to move the parts in 3D in your mind to find the solutions.Half of the pleasure comes from optimizing the designs;Can be a time sink."
309,2582,Addictive.
310,2582,An exciting diversion for those times when you just want to stick blocks together.Would welcome a port to mobile. And subtitles for the failure logs.
311,2582,even the hardest puzzles are still fun
312,2582,This game is great.  Really challenging and a lot of fun to play.  I highly recommend.
313,2582,Interesting and fun puzzles with just enough story to tie them together. Histograms with three different score categories encourage optimization that is the real challenge of this game.
314,2582,Great puzzle game that can run on my toaster
315,2582,Best puzzle game i've ever played.
316,2582,One of the best puzzle games
317,2582,feels good
318,2582,Puzzling and creepy aliens come together
319,2582,Finally a game where the scoreboard cannot be cheatedThe puzzles are nice too ;)
320,2582,Can get very challenging but it is very satisfying when you complete a level
321,2582,"Challenging but fun.If you like puzzles and/or programming, this is a very satisfying game."
322,2582,Probably my favorite of the Zachtronics games. More on the casual side for their library but still challenging and the replay value is far and above any other game in my library. Definitely pick this up if you like puzzle games.
323,2582,"Spacechem in 3d. Careful assembly and planning, ending in that satisfying feeling from solving a problem. Trial, error, trial, okay that works, trial, wait frack I need to rebuild that whole thing, trial, okay good that works now, and now I just put those together, wait no it needs to attach from *that* side, aaaaand, HAHA! SUCCESS!"
324,2582,"The game is awesome, keeps you entertained for hours, the story is just a bit short"
325,2582,"Of the Zachtronics games I've played, this and Opus Magnum are the two most approachable to new players.Both are good choices, but Infinifactory gets much, MUCH harder by the end."
326,2582,"It reminds me of Portal, but with conveyor belts instead of portals.Now your thinking with conveyor belts..."
327,2582,"This game is by far my favorite factory design game on steam, no pesky restrictions like resource gathering, just optimization."
328,2582,Simple and straightforward puzzler with a slow but steady difficulty curve. Simple graphics can run on a potato and the story elements are neat but unobtrusive.
329,2582,Infinifactory is amazing but at the time I'm writing this the steam grand prix in going on and its terrible. Just marking this disaster for future generations
330,2582,Buy this!
331,2582,"Upfront, this game is a lot of fun and some of the problems can be quite challenging to solve.Basically it functions as if you're trying to assemble things in minecraft, but only have a handful of blocks to use and limited orientation to place them.That being said, it feels like some of the blocks (looking at you, rotator) have some awkward and annoying limits that after playing for several hours, I still have not figured out.Game is still challenging and fun, but some of the edge cases can be very frustrating, but for the cheap price, I am still enjoying my time with the game."
332,2582,Your machine is never good enough.
333,2582,i bought this without knowing what it was then quit then idk  off
334,2582,"If you like programming or logic puzzles, this is the game for you. There's lots of challenging puzzles with no one way to solve, enabling your creativity and critical thinking. The small bits of backstory are also a neat way to encourage your progress."
335,2582,"This is a great puzzle game and definitely one of my favorites, giving this game a thumbs up."
336,2582,Starts off simple enough but the puzzles quickly pick up difficulty and have virtually endless solutions giving it plenty of challenge and replayability! The story is also odd and charming which is always a plus in my book.
337,2582,Yes
338,2581,"First, i'll talk about the game itself.The game has a rather interesting story. The building aspect is fun, and creative. The puzzles may be hard, but it gives a rewarding puzzle once you solve it. Be it simple, or complex.Now, i'll talk about my experiance with the game.By playing this game for a few hours, i've gained a bit more selfrespect. The rewarding feeling i talked about earlier? It's alot for people who hate themself. This game showed me that even i can solve complex stuff, and to not give up.All in all, im very glad i purchased this game, and give my fullest thanks to the developers of the game, who showed me a little self respect again."
339,2581,"One of the most fun games that ever made me want to break down in frustrated, depressed, angry, tears.If you're looking for a way to rapidly fluctuate your ego all the way from- Loudly yelling about how sore your neck is from the giant brain it's carryingtoQuietly wondering how someone as dumb as you can even still be alive.Then this is the game for you!"
340,2581,"This is by far the best game i have played for a long time, its really refreshing to see something that doesn't have +1 achievement unlocked, upgrade grinds, micro transactions or any of that other garbage they apparently teach people at uni is how to make a game.I really hope that you wont be put off by any of the bad reviews, i have read a lot of them and frankly most of their complaints just don't hold water.This is a creative free space, you are completely free to achieve the level objective in any way that you want to, using any amount of blocks, taking any route, using any methods and in any order and if you don't like the level you can build your own levels or download levels that others have made.This is not an empire game however and if you thought you were going to be amassing virtual coin then you should look else where, this is not that sort of game.The story is a bit weak, i thought the premise was excellent actually especially considering that it is in no way a requirement for the core game experience. But there is not a lot of story content and the script is pretty awful, but it has its moments.  I would really have liked to see this go to a seriously dark place, I felt for sure that the second food type mission was going to be soylent green.The only complaint with merit is that you are left to figure things out on your own and while i did not have any problems i also didn't see things at first which I'm sure some other people would have seen.The fact of the matter is that intelligence is going to help you be good at this game, there is no getting away from that and if that's something you struggle with then I would say adjust your expectations accordingly, what i wouldn't say is stay away but the developer could have been more aware that some people need more help than others to get started.The other major point in which people are falling down and having problems is their inability to rate their own performances.This is a challenging game, if you want it to be. Average ability is going to be enough to complete this game but if you want to get top tier scores you are going to have to put some time and care in but most importantly you need to actually understand the scoreboard.There are 3 categories cycles, footprint and blocks. So how fast you have completed the level, your ability to think in 3 dimensions and make use of vertical space and your precision, these are very different things and you should not expect to score highly in all areas, they are mutually exclusive, you optimise your build for 1 of the 3 if you want to after you have completed the level already.There are people posting negative reviews of this game because they expected to score highly on all 3 of these mutually exclusive measures on their first play through. So if what you are seeking is validation and you were expecting a gold star just for turning up this isn't going to be for you. Maybe you should ask mummy for a cuddle? Other complaints I have seen state that after a couple of levels its all just the same thing. This is simply not the case, new features and new problems are introduced with most levels for most of the game and after that what changes is scale which completely changes everything. Techniques you were using with small work pieces may not work on a larger scale and as the production runs become longer and more complex a delay in one area could cause a jam somewhere else.There is a lot going on here and if you like building games like lego you are going to have fun with this game.I would have liked to have seen stronger pushers, more verticality, full if / and / or logic circuits (I don't think you can do this, but maybe I have missed something?) much darker story and content and more turn x into y and use for z type materials.Oh an cranes.. and the ability to rotate group selections.Biggest problem i had by far is that the change tool interface doesn't always seem to work, i think it could be something like I am releasing the shift button a microsecond before i am left clicking to select and it doesn't allow for and fix my garbage human input. Which is important, good ui's intuit what you meant to do rather than listening to what you actually did.Its not street fighter, I shouldn't have to pull off a combo move into the laser blocks face to select it. Left clicking should be just fine."
341,2581,"I'm giving this game a thumbs up with one reservation - it needs gamepad support.  I do not like playing WASD with mouse.  It hurts my wrist.  Other than that, nice little puzzler."
342,2581,Prof.Vaharrak's Curator Group - Almost 30 years of gaming experience at your serviceAnother fantastic installment of Zachtronics legendary puzzles saga. Now in 3D!Guaranteed to wring your brain for a while.
343,2581,Best North Korea simulator out there.10/10 would make against my will a factory that produces missels againSatisfying puzzelgame were you can build any type of factory and let you use your creativity freely. Solid 8/10 would like to see some submodes in the game. Then it would be a 10 for me
344,2581,"Zachtronics first foray into 3d? right? It's pretty good so far. I like the setting. You need to approach it like a puzzle game though. I played the first few levels with factorio in mind, and it hampered my progress. My only complaint is that so far there has only been one music track playing, and it has a weird loop point that sounds terrible. It's more frustrating than the puzzles tbh.It's not as buttoned up as Zach's other games, and for some reason way more expensive than his other titles. I wouldn't have been happy if i paid 24.99 for it, but it's worth picking up on sale."
345,2581,my head hurts.
346,2581,"This is a great puzzle game and definitely one of my favorites. Out of all the Zach-like games I've played, this is the most accessible, so I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys puzzle games. Out of the last 48 hours, since I bought this game, I've poured 12.5 into it. The puzzles are not too easy and not too hard, somewhere between Zenge and Lyne. The solutions often require an iterative approach, so if they don't work the first time, try again. I might also have a special appreciation for this game since I'm an engineer. The gameplay itself in reminiscent of Factorio and, dare I say, Minecraft."
347,2581,Great game but you guys should stop comparing this to Factorio or Satisfactory. This is NOT a factory building game. It's a PUZZLE game that uses conveyors as its set pieces.
348,2581,Challenging and enjoyable 3d puzzle game.  Highly recommendedI've played 18 hours in 3 days.  I can't stop.  Help
349,2581,a really cool game
350,2581,"you like logic puzzles, fixing problems and play with machinerynp, just get this game while in sale, you've been kidnapped by aliens (youre not the first lol)to solve their industrial needs & problems..watch out ! dont bust your brain enjoy !"
351,2581,"It's too intensive for my pc, it heats up like crazy, and I've experienced several freezes.Intel core i5 1.60ghz 8gb RAM Radeon g cardI've played on low graphics"
352,2581,Very creative and good for critical thinking!
353,2581,"Infinifactory is a typical Zachtronics game. It's a logic puzzle masquerading as a factory. The essence of the game is using conveyor belts, welders, pistons, and other devices to assemble blocks into a particular shape, while being constrained by space and environmental layout. Yes, this is essentially a lego factory. These puzzles require serious thought and planning, so this game is not for the easily frustrated. Difficulty ramps up pretty quickly, and often you will discover the approach you were trying just won't work, and you have to start all over. One odd design decision is that the explanation for new blocks first appears only as a simple drawing, and the full text description appears only AFTER you have first solved a puzzle with the blocks.This is a game I play in spurts. The frustration factor makes me give up on it after a while, and come back later. Compared to the other Zachtronics games I have played, I rank it like this:1. Opus Magnum (This game is a masterpiece)2. Shenzen IO3. Infinifactory4. TIS-100 (I really didn't like this one)Inifnifactory is ok. Not nearly as good as Opus Magnum, not not nearly as bad as TIS-100. If you like Zachtronics game, give it a shot. If you've never played one before, play Opus Magnum first."
354,2581,"On of the most interesting puzzle games I have played in a while. The Story is very loose but amazing and brings a smile to my face every time I learn something new about the world. The mechanics are difficult and the satisfaction is immense, once you get it right.Recommended!"
355,2581,"This is a great puzzle problem-solving game. It's well polished, and challenging. I've heard of developer and some of their games for a while, but I had no idea Infinifactory was this good. I'll definitely be checking out their other games."
356,2581,"This game was immediately addicting. I really like games that make me think and visualize. It is easy to learn and fun to attempt alternate solutions. I am a bit puzzled by the scoring however. I don't understand the meaning of the graphs or what my scoring goal should be. For example which is a better score, using more blocks or fewer blocks?The music is a bit boring and it defaults to way too loud. I turned it down almost as far as I could. The graphics are great and the mechanics are superb. This game is highly recommended. 10/10"
357,2580,I've got a bunch of Zachtronics games and I enjoy them all! They are great puzzle games!
358,2580,extrude to your heart's desire
359,2580,Intro is 10/10 worth the $7.19 i spent just for that lmao..
360,2580,
361,2579,"I broke the game as soon as I was given conveyors, 10/10"
362,2579,"A really nice puzzle game with a good premise, interesting storytelling and engaging mechanics."
363,2577,"This is a really cool puzzle game set in 3D.  I leave it for months, then come back to it and play it for a week straight.If you've got time to kill and want to keep your mind busy, this is it."
364,2577,"This is an excellent engineering game by Zachtronics, continuing the legacy left by SpaceChem. Zach has gone on to make several more games with this style of gameplay, check them out too!"
365,2566,Incredibly fun and challenging game.It doesn't do too much hand-holding which I really like.
366,2566,thumbs down because i cant get the game to play in windowed mode
367,2564,v good
368,2564,yes good
369,2564,One of my all-time favorite games -- the only Platinum I've ever achieved on PS4.
370,2562,"This game is a ton of fun, providing a lot of creative freedom for something that advertises itself as a puzzle game. I felt a ton of autonomy in the design of my factories, so each puzzle felt like a unique individual experience as I learned the mechanisms by which to best optimize my own solutions. That being said, the game suffers pretty severely from being a three-dimensional game; I feel as if the extent to which altitude comes into any sort of meaningful consideration in the game is pretty low, yet it adds a lot of menial clicking around to incorporate into solution designs. In that respect, this game is definitely a super slow burner; very little time is spent ""designing"" compared to the very high amount of time required for ""implementation"". This in itself isn't terrible if there is a degree of fun or pleasure in the implementation process, but for me it was not a core appeal.The setting is mildly depressing and the soundtrack is not especially commendable, but the game is easy on the eyes nevertheless. It feels well rounded all things considered. Overall, I had a lot of fun with Infinifactory, more than enough to make up for the times it tested my patience."
371,2562,"Very well-balanced play. The difficulty scales up satisfyingly as the game progresses, and there's a near infinite range of bonus optimization challenges for those who want a bigger challenge.Unexpectedly funny, too!"
372,2561,Fantastic.  Some of the levels take me quite a while to solve.
373,2560,"Note: Don't visit community hub for infinifactory before progressing in story. It may spoil solutions for many puzzles. But definetely visit after completing optimization achievements. There is inspiration in community hub.There are 2 types of puzzle games:1. Linear, aka Find the solution (exp. Portal, Talos Principle, sudoku)2. Open, aka Produce a solution (exp. Human Resource Machine)Infinifactory is an Open style puzzle game. There can be many different ways to solve the same puzzle. As you will see in global scoreboard for every puzzle, no 2 players' solutions are the same. Achievements also show that there is in fact more efficient way of solving the puzzle you just solved."
374,2560,"I come back to this from time to time which already says a lot. Great single player game if you like puzzling, building, optimizing and slamming your head into your desk when you thought you were done and forgot something at the start of your contraption."
375,2559,"This game is good. Unlike a lot of puzzle games where you are left feeling like an idiot for not realizing the solution sooner, this game makes you feel like a genius because *you* are the one creating the solution. When you build a factory, it is as much a creative endeavor as it is an intellectual one, and you are pushed to make your factory more elegant. There are some minor downsides that you get used to fairly quickly. One or two things that are not properly explained. The only *major*downside of this game is the difficulty curve. The first 50% of this game is a smooth ramp up in difficulty and feels very natural. 51% - 90% is a plateu, and you don't feel like it is getting at all more complicated as it goes along. Then the final 10% is an extreme jump that pretends the the last 40% continued to teach you new techniques."
376,2558,"I got this game for free with some kind of bundle pack I believe there was 2 or 3 games in that pack I wanted and it was on one hell of a great sale (80% off I believe) well fast forward to just a few days ago and I thought ehh I'll give it a shot what's the worst that can happen? I absolutely love this game it's easy at first but challenging as f**k. You really have to think outside the box to get this game understood beautifully. Sure the graphics are a joke but so are the graphics for Minecraft so I like games that make you first go yeah I will be needing to get these parts all in the correct order for it to get built right all and all this game is interesting and fun, one minor change I'd recommend is for the aliens talking instead of [unintelligible gargling] I think it would be interesting if the head alien gives you praise for solving the tasks but then belittles you for being a human. Also I'd like a dlc that lets us learn about the poor puppy that's dead in the start of the game. This game is wonderful and challenging but a hint option could be helpful when being introduced to new parts"
377,2558,Another absolutely wonderful Zachtronics game!
378,2557,"Optimization Zen After a few well-built tutorial levels to introduce the mechanics of the game, you're off to the races. An (almost) entirely unconstrained sandbox environment is presented for the crafting and and optimization of a solution. Each puzzle allows for three separate solutions to be constructed and saved, and each solution is scored on three metrics. Your low score from each is counted towards your overall score, which invites the player to create 3 unique solutions for each puzzle in order to achieve the lowest combined score .Lovely atmospheric music, loads of workshop puzzles to keep you going, and a zero-lag UI? It's a perfect way to unwind after work. Watching your little factory methodically stamp out product is much more satisfying than it should be. Worth the full price tag, but if you happen to catch it on sale, definitely don't hesitate."
379,2557,A fantastic game if you're looking for a calm yet challenging singleplayer experience. Some levels I found really tricky to complete but in the end it's all the more rewarding if you figure out a working solution. Bonus points for the fantastic soundtrack that fits the game and playstyle perfectly.
380,2556,I feel like this game has taken part of my soul. In a good way though. Feel nothing no more. 10/10 would become comfortably numb again.
381,2556,"Infinfactory is still by far the most polished of Zachtronic's games, and in my opinion the most intuitive. If you've played any of their other games you know mostly what to expect, and I'd recommend it. The move to 3D from Spacechem allows them to add more tools that you can build with, and another dimension to work in for complexity. Many worlds feature unique gimmicks that mix things up too.If you haven't played a Zachtronic's game, it's a puzzle game, but not the normal sort. You are given tools, and have to engineer A solution, rather than find THE solution. I'd recommend it if you like problem solving, or the sense of accomplishment you get from coding. My only complaint is that the later levels begin to feel too much like work.Also, I'd be remiss without mentioning that, despite the story being mostly there for dark humour, the environments and chill electronic music really sell the locations you're in."
382,2555,I had a lot of fun playing this game
383,2555,Pleases the autism inside me.This game is very correct and ordered.Love it. If you like the elegance and efficiency of factories you'll love this.
384,2555,"The intro sold it, period.-"
385,2555,"This puzzle game is somehow extremely well balanced so that you almost never get stuck. There is always something else to try, so you keep experimenting until you succeed. Classic Zachtronics sandbox puzzler. The pleasant graphics and original story complement the puzzles very well and keep you interested beyond just solving logical challenges. And it's actually funny!"
386,2554,"Infinifactory is a game that will make you feel happy when you solve a puzzle, melancholy (but in a good way) when you follow the story, like an idiot when you struggle and then like a genius when you build an elegant optimised factory that uses the fewest blocks running at the highest speed.The game sometimes seems brutally hard to solve. Thankfully the building controls are excellent. There is some uneveness in the difficulty level, although as you progress you can rebuild elements you will have learned by solving previous puzzles. Over time you will build various solutions to fabrication stages that can be tweaked, repeated, adapted and optimised to construct fantastically elaborate factories to puzzles that hours previously threatened to melt your brain. Learn that only a single block needs to be touching a conveyor belt to travel along it (you can have real-world-impossible constructions overhanging the belt without it falling off). Understand that you can use the next unwelded block or construction to push a completed object further on its way. Discover that having parts travel forwards, backwards, up, down, sideways, rotated, looped, delayed and in parallel are sometimes the only way to get large constructions made in a tight spot. And if you really struggle there are tip videos on youtube that teach you construction methods without giving away the solutions.If you like puzzles, engineering and building things then this is one game you absolutely must play. Infinifactory will give you one of the most unique and charming game experiences you will ever have.Highly recommended."
387,2554,"It is what it looks like.  It's a Zachtronics game, increasingly complicated puzzles, connected with a light but sometimes amusing story.   The unique aspect here is that it's 3D, and their format translates well to this.   If you're into building your own solutions to puzzle games, thinking of things in an engineering and efficiency way, don't miss this one.  Great game."
388,2553,good
389,2552,"Highly recommended. The puzzles involve building multiple copies of a designated object using supplied source blocks. To accomplish this you are given a variety of tools (conveyors, pushers, welders, etc.) that you arrange in a 3D environment.As you progress, the puzzles get harder, but you also get new tools. Solving a puzzle gives you three scores, one each for cycle time (how long your solution takes to run, not to construct), block count (how many tool blocks you used), and footprint (essentially how much ""floor space"" your solution uses).  Even after you solve a puzzle, you can go back and try to minimize your scores, or even just try an entirely defferent solution. Your score is highlighted on a histogram of all players's scores and listed with any of your friends who have completed a particular puzzle. Or you can ignore the histograms and just try to beat your own score.The only negative thing I can say about the game is that there are only 3 solution save slots for each puzzle."
390,2551,"A 3-d version version of Zachtonics earlier game Space-Chem and probably the most accessible of any Zachtonics game I have played. It won't be for everyone, as it is not about eye-candy and adrenelin but problem solving. I say ""problem"" rather than ""puzzle"" solving as there is never one a single solution but many possible solutions to a level though some solutions are better than others. The designing of the processes to assemble, or sometimes disassemble, the required structures from the starting blocks is programming disguised as puzzles. The interface and controls are fairly intuitive and easy to learn and I had not problem getting back into game after not playing it for months - and it is a game you can come back to again and again.Although the framing story for the puzzle problems, involving being abducted by aliens, is a little weak if you have been paying attention then a there is piece of tat which are given which is absolutely heartbreaking."
391,2551,Nice game
392,2551,Very addicting.Somehow managed to complete a few levels before noticing you could change number of blocks as input.
393,2551,Very expert
394,2551,"Get this if you want to keep your brain engaged. Others have classified this as a ""problem solving"" game as opposed to a ""puzzle"" game, and I think that's fair. You're given tools with which to solve increasingly complex problems, and you're free to approach the problems however you can. It's about sitting down, breaking the problem into parts, figuring out the details, and bringing it all together. At the end of a (later) level, your solution will be more complex than you could have pictured or comprehended before you started going at it; but, more importantly, it will be your solution. And that's brilliant."
395,2551,"Just play this, it is the best 3D puzzle game on steam"
396,2551,Nice.
397,2551,"Highly recommended. Find and listen to the audio tapes, chase the various achievements and enjoy designing and running your solutions."
398,2551,It is a lot of fun! (and headaches... which is fun too!)
399,2551,"It's a Zachtronics game. So you know it's A) Good B) going to break your brain.You use mechanical parts to create factory machines. There are multiple ways to solve these problems, so the replayability is super high. The faster/more simple your solution is, the better. I'm not even that far into the game and I'm already wondering how it's going to keep getting HARDER. But, Zachtronics games seem to always been constructed in such a way that as difficulty rises, it never seems like it is becoming an insurmountable task. There is also some story that unfolds as you move through the game, but I would by no means consider this a ""story-rich"" game, or even as story focused as a game like Portal. However, it doesn't matter to a player like me as I am here for the puzzles."
400,2551,"something different, nonetheless it isn't easy"
401,2551,"Reccomended, if not to only look at the low cycle solution leaderboards for grim and constant reminder of how infinitely inferior your own creations are"
402,2551,"No one does unique puzzlers like Zachtronics.  Of their catalog, Infinifactory is the pinnacle.  The puzzles are challenging yet not cruel.  For those who like it extra hard the difficulty can even be adjusted.  The level design is seemless with the tasks.  Given the factory theme of the game you don't so much feel like you are solving puzzles as building products.  With close to 200 hours on record, I keep coming back to replay or tweek my solutions for just a little more performance.  This is one of those games that is an instant classic and everyone should play."
403,2551,Great puzzle game!If you liked Spacechem or TS-100 you will feel quite at home with this game. A bunch of puzzle and yet not void of story. Definitely worth keeping an eye on.
404,2551,good game
405,2551,I still return to this game ocasionally even after three years.  I recomend to anyone whom likes puzzle games.
406,2551,best game
407,2551,"Awesome and challenging puzzle in 3D with machinery - great way to stimulate the mind and pass some spare time. Takes a few iterations to get the gist of tricks that help with solving the puzzles, but the reward is .......well ....... very rewarding ! I work to serve the masterlords !"
408,2551,It's like doing homework.. In 3D
409,2551,"Simple, fun, challenging enough to make you think. Good game."
410,2550,Very fun.
411,2550,Work that brain!!
412,2550,"Challenging but, also very rewarding and fun."
413,2550,One of the best puzzle games I've played. I love how you're able to create any solution you like. It's a real brain teaser!
414,2550,Absurdly addictive and fun. If you like Minecraft's redstone contraptions and industrial planning you will love this game.
415,2550,Awesome game!
416,2550,Computer engineering in a game
417,2550,Has to be one of the most satisfying games I have ever played!
418,2550,"Awesome puzzles, awesome story"
419,2550,"Very interesting and challenging puzzles. There is never one way to solve the puzzles either, its a nice mix of creativity and logic."
420,2550,"I usually play a totally different type of game and even when I play puzzle games I prefer a simpler style.So I was really surprised how soon this game dragged me into it and how much I like it!!This game is challenging but never so much that it results in frustration. And it is really satisfying once your machines finally run and therefore super addictive.My boyfriend and I play it both and have so much fun competing who built the best, most efficient, fastest machinery or  how to get the achievements.I love how this game doesn't have this one solution to figure out. No, everyone has his own way of thinking and finds his individual way to solve the puzzles. It's really great!This game deserves way more attention! Highly recommended!"
421,2550,my head hurt mom help
422,2550,"If you like block-puzzle games, this is quite nice. Not a hard challenge, but you have to combine known elements in new ways regularly. Well worth the price."
423,2548,"Very bland. Cool conept and theme but the goals are boring and unrewarding. Each level gets increasingly difficult and if you dont understand, well, theres no hints other than little holograms that basically tell you nothing. I see how this game could be done well but I haven't seen much of it."
424,2548,Zach never lets you down. You let yourself down cause you can't solve the puzzle.10/10 would buy another Zachtronics game to feel frustrated.
425,2548,Juas got this game at under 7 dollars.  Im about an hour and a half in.. Absolutely worth it! Peaceful and a lot of fun. Controls are perfect when you are trying to build the perfect machine to complete the task you are never fighting the interface. Very creative and if you want an absolutely fun factory game that is pick up and go with little to no frustration this is it. You cannot go wrong for the price. You will be thinking of solutions to a puzzle all the time and be dying to get back and try your new Idea.
426,2548,Design assembly lines in different ways to maximize different criteria.  It's fun!
427,2548,is cool
428,2548,"Me not so smart, me have hard time, me still like this game."
429,2548,+ nice puzzles
430,2548,The game feels useless and is not intertaining it would be more intertaining if you were able to make anything you wanted beseides what they want you to make like run your own actual factory i would not recommend buying this game
431,2548,"Really really good game!  Probably my favorite Zachtronics game.  But it's sort of hard to write a review for...  How would you know if you'd like this sort of game or not???  I guess if you think you -might- like this sort of game, this is probably the one I'd recommend starting with.I do have a theory that this would make a great intro to programming.  I think it does a great job of introducing the idea of breaking a process down into logical sub steps.  But because of the 3D and more 'tangible' activity you're accomplishing, it seems totally removed from the 2d wall of syntax people seem to have trouble with.I would recommend giving it a while since it has sort of a slow start.  I'm a fan of all the Zachtronics games but I was several (maybe as many as a dozen?) levels into this one before I really got into it.  I was even thinking about returning it!  Maybe it started so slow that it took a while to get into the meaty puzzles."
432,2547,"[tl;dr]It's a great game if you enjoy logic tests and optimization, and a good introduction to the Zachtronics style.[Overview]Infinifactory is likely the most ""accessible"" of Zachtronics' various ""puzzle"" games, at least insofar as my experience goes. It's very intuitive, which is a good thing because unlike most of Zachtronics' other games there's no 30-page-long manual to understand the mechanics; they just throw you into the game with a few tools and continually drip-feed new tools to keep the solutions more and more complex. I'd personally recommend this to people who are new to this studio's games and want a warm-up before diving into the depths with something like Opus Magnum or SpaceChem.I'm not the best judge of music, so I'm not going to rate it one way or the other. The sound effects, however, are very satisfying, particularly when you've got a complex machine constantly pushing and welding in rhythm.Visually speaking, it looks like a massively updated Infiniminer. While it's tough to say that it has the same sort of striking visuals as some of their other games, more than anything it needs to be evidently clear which bit of a Rube Goldbergian assembly line does what, and in that regard they are successful.More so than anything, the only advice I can really give is: Experiment. Test out all the different blocks and the way they interact with each other. The more little quirks you notice, the more you feel like a genius and the more satisfying it will be when it all comes together."
433,2541,A satisfying puzzle game. Highly recommended.
434,2540,The closest thing i would link this to is a hardcore puzzle focus version of Portalspeaking of whichIs it just me or would this game be even better with Co Op support?
435,2534,it stinks
436,2534,"If you like 3D puzzles that require a lot of thought, then this game will suit you well.It has a lot of content and some very challenging puzzles."
437,2534,"Factorio meets Minecraft. Assemble increasingly complex assembly lines to convert inputs into outputs in a colorful set of alien worlds. From conveyors to pistions to logic nodes to even laser beams, you'll be tasked with all manner of jobs by your indifferent, alien overlords for whatever odd, dull reasons they have. Chairs, turrets, robot tanks, spaceship parts... what are they up to? And will you ever make it home if you complete enough shifts?A fun and wonderful story makes this Zachatronics game something I love to recommend to others. Unlike many others by the same developer, this one features easy to learn and tactile sets of tools in a fully 3-D space, allowing you to manufacture all kinds of fun solutions. Listen to the radio logs tethered to the corpses of less-fortunate coworkers, all while traversing dozens of planets, each and every one being stripped for resources to feed an ever-hungry empire."
438,2533,"Fun for programmers like any Zachtronics game, but in 3D a-la Minecraft."
439,2532,"Wait, I thought this was Factorio"
440,2531,Not really particulary interesting.
441,2530,"The game is well made, it has beautiful graphics, but the one problem it has for me is that the game itself is too hard. I'm not new to puzzle games but you aren't given much at all towards what the blocks do and I found myself being stuck on levels with no clue on how to solve them. I definitely feel like they could have given more help/info towards how to solve levels which probably would have made me keep this game."
442,2530,"I recommend this for anyone thats hardcore puzzle solver, this will take alot of time from you to beat it. The whole point is creating your own factory and create/destroy stuff and put them in the right place and send it to the hologram in order to complete the game. Reason why I said ""hardcore"" because this game is by far very difficult even in the beginning level. Its tedious at times as well because despite how you make it, theres always something that messes up and you have to fix it.For me I tend to get bored at times because I would use the walkthrough and sometimes create my own similar style to the walkthrough I saw. I know I'd be lying if I said this isnt a challenge. My small issue with this game is that I wish they made it a bit easier in the beginning levels. Other than that, very fun if you are up for a challenge."
443,2530,"Really good game, I'm greatly enjoying the puzzles so far. Makes me think and makes coming up with the solution very satisfying."
444,2530,fun game tbqh
445,2530,"Really cool game, but you can play it out whitin 30 hours"
446,2529,"I am reccomending the game because it isn't bad, BUTIn all honesty, this is probably the weakest of all the Zachtronics games. The puzzles themselves are fairly fun and its very satisfying to watch the creation you've made  after a long time tinkering.That being said, the fact that they made this first person really does it no favors. It makes things take longer to tinker with and makes building feel a bit cludgier. There doesn't seem to be any real reason or need for it to have been 1st Person and that design decision seems actively makes the game feel a little worse. Additionally, the storyline itself seems far weaker than the other games they have made, nor does the art design really stick with me like any of their other games do. If you're a fan of Zachtronics other games and are looking for more, this is absolutely worth the buy, but if you're new, I would heavily reccomend playing either SpaceChem or Opus Magnum first. If you're not a fan of those games, this game probably won't do much for you either."
447,2529,Worth it =)
448,2529,"When I play this game I enjoy it. The puzzels are tought but not imppossible and the enviroment/setting is intresting. However it crashes far too often for me to recommend it, it has started to happen now every 30 seconds."
449,2529,"The game doesn't treat you like a dumb person, nor a person who knows everything. It knows how to guide you to push yourself without holding your hand."
450,2528,"Loved this game.  Still have not beaten all the levels, after almost 300 hrs of play time.  I wish Zachtronics would add some more levels as DLC.  I also wish that there would be an update adding some new concepts, like letting the conveyors and welders to be ued in all 3 dementions not just 2 or  like the on/off switch, that you don't get until the end and then it doesn'r seem to be used in any non-custom levels and controls very few blocks in the game.  But, overall great game.  highly recomended."
451,2528,A production line puzzle game but with more emphasis on the puzzle.
452,2527,"Very good game, but extremely bugged on my amd machine. Disappointing for a $25 game. It crashes about every 15 minutes. The only game that experiences this problem on my computer, and I can run Elite: Dangerous on max settings at 1440p and get 100 fps."
453,2527,"I wonder if this game has an end to it. I played and played and played. The game got harder and harder. It's been a while since I played, but the last thing I remember is being up in the early hours of the morning designing a system that would slice up a whale and send its white and dark meat into separate processing stations.Okay, but it doesn't start off that way. The thing starts you off real easy like. Gives you a few primitives and tells you to move some simple stuff around. No big deal. Next thing you know you are slaughtering whales and making guns for some aliens. I need to pick it back up again, but it was so addictive I had to uninstall it. It had me captive and I fell in love with it in proper Stockholm style. I was seeing this game when I closed my eyes. I woke up in cold sweats when my factory footprint was getting out of hand in my dreams...Give it a try, it will make you stronger."
454,2526,InFunagamory
455,2525,"A great problem-solving game. I haven't gotten very far yet but I can say that this game goes easy on you, unlike spacechem. It teaches the concepts one by one, letting you learn. Buy it if you like coding or puzzles in general."
456,2525,One of the more accessible Zachtronics games - very enjoyable and addicitve!
457,2525,"The game designers did a good job in showing you the controls and what can basicly be done with the blocks without spoiling solutions. But you can find lots of hidden mechanics by combining certain tools that make your life much easier. Also the design, the sound and the story of the game are well done.After a few hours of having fun I thought I finished the game. Then I realized, that I only finished the first part of the game. The second part was... mindbending. The game teaches you to develop your very own style of solving these puzzles and somehow I feel much smarter now :-)"
458,2524,"It took me a while to get into the game, but the moment I did, I couldn't put it down. The puzzles are more than satisfying, and I found myself continuing to think about the solution even after I moved on. The game is addictive beyond all else, really."
459,2524,Compelling engineering game; just when you think you beat it there's a whole other set of levels.  I love Zachtronics games and this does not dissapoint.  3D puzzle building allows a lot of possibilties.
460,2523,"Very happy with the interface, pacing, and overall tone of the game. Puzzle games need some edge, and this delivers, so long as you don't look too critically. Really love how you don't have a 20 minute pedantic tutorial with a narrator that talks to you like you're some kind of moron. See thing, do thing. Go go go!"
461,2522,I kind of thought this would be like a 3d factorio or minecraft for some reason. It's more like an episodic puzzle game though. Still pretty fun.
462,2519,Lets start. The game started with me crashing all the time. I used the report an issue feather and the developer made me aware that it was my onedrive causing the crash ( i knew it was a read write error but i was not even thinking about onedrive ) Disabling onedrive save fixed the issue. I got an answer in less then one day. This in its alone speaks of really good support !Beside that the game is really nice and fun brain teaser. There is really no cons i can thing of only pros with this game and the developer. Therfore its a clear upvote for me here
463,2519,i was downloaging from the workshop when i haven don the campane it wont let me play the maps i download [WARNING HAVE TO DO THE CAMPANE] STUPED GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
464,2518,This is more then a puzzle game. With a small selection of part types you must build a sometimes complex factory that converts a timed feed of raw materials to the final product. It is a puzzle in three dimensional space and time. I have played games all my life and this unlike anything I have ever played. The experience is more like a graphical representation of building an electronics skematic or writing a software application. You start out solving simple tasks and in no time you are building complex machines that you can just sit back and enjoy watching run. Sooo satisfying!!!
465,2518,"Puzzle-mechatronics. One of the most insane, creative games ever seen."
466,2518,"Nice game, love how the leaderboard statistics show that others have found better solutions than you pushing you too improveThe game is very long though, still havent finished it maybe Ill get back to it later"
467,2517,"Its a good puzzle game, a thinking game. If you want a fun puzzle game with a story, thing portal, if you want a thinking puzzle game, where you can spend hours making things more efficent or just figuring out how to solve the damn thing, think inififactory. its a good game, but id wait for a sale, unless youre an engineer or want to learn about basic basic manufacturing"
468,2516,"Really enjoyed this.  A few levels were true mind benders that force you to adapt new techinques into your factory building that I really enjoyed.  But some of the later levels aren't hard per say, but rather just too labor intensive... I see the solution, but actually buliding it and hammering out the details would just take too long and other games have caught my attention =)I do recommend the game though.  It's a really fun 'problem solving' type of game."
469,2516,This game is very fun on a lot of levels.  Carefully figuring out each puzzle piece-by-piece is an incredibly satisfying experience.  Some levels I test / small fix / retest several dozen times before it works perfectly but each failure / success is a fun learning experience.  I also really love the sound effects and ambient noise of the Cell (where you select puzzles / objectives) and various levels.The controls for building and moving around are rock solid and very intuitive.  The basic concept of the game is very easy to learn.
470,2516,"If you've never played a Zachtronics game or have been scared by the difficulty of their other games, this is the perfect game to start with. I recommend the game for it's first half, where I really though like my mind was adapting to the rules of the game, and slowly increased my efficiently came naturally. The eureka moments are great where you think of new concepts.However If you are not confident in your problem solving abilities, like myself, I recommend stopping at the mid point (clearly divided, you'll know) as the later puzzles start to feel like you are fighting the game rather that fighting your brain. Stuff like material efficiency seems like a cheap way of making you restart a puzzle 1 hour in. By the end of the game I was spending multiple hours on each factory and seeing the factory break on items 7 was heartbreaking.The main mechanics were great but I would have prefered some more functionality. For example timers and auto-toggles. A copy/paste page, saved custom parts. The other thing that would help is guidebook for different systems, this would allow for a more natural understanding of concepts, instead of the nature of having a non-efficient version that ends up ruining your build."
471,2515,"One of the best puzzle games to be found. People who are giving bad reviews because it is too hard is just ridiculous and direspectful.The feeling of viewing your machine putting parts together, and it works, is just amazing. This game share almost the same mechanics as the new 2d-puzzle game Opus Magnum, but I like this one much better."
472,2513,"Infinifactory follows the same formula as SpaceChem and Opus Magnum, except w/ a 3-D first-person view.The problem is this: trying to solve a puzzle in 3-D involves overhead of maneuvering your character and camera.  This creates tedium, which detracts from the core of the game, which is solving puzzles.If you don't own any Zachtronics games, get Opus Magnum and/or SpaceChem first.  If you want a fresh take, try this one.  On its own, it's a good puzzle game, so I won't penalize Zachtronics for making better ones."
473,2513,dus is good
474,2511,"Boring. Repetitive. Thought it would be more like factorio, but in 3d. But this is just a basic ass puzzle game."
475,2511,"I love everything about this game honestly. Rather than figuring out a specific answer to a puzzle, as long as you create a solution that works- you succeed. At the end of each level, it shows you some stats about how other people did in order to encourage you to change your design. I've found it to be a lot of fun to make the most arbitraty design as possible, but there's a definite triumph in creating the most efficient machine you can.  There's also a bit of humor in its lore which I found enjoyable.If you are interested in puzzles and enjoy a good challenge definitely pick this up!"
476,2510,Just buy it. Ingenious game.
477,2509,Please let me skip the intro and the tutorial and anything else I'm going to be forced to endure mindlessly...
478,2508,Very good and challenging game. Unexpected in many ways especially towards the end.
479,2508,"Zachtronics creates games that ask the player to build a solution to solve a problem. I like these types of games and have written good reviews on a few Zachtronic games. I really want to write a good review of Infinifactory but I can't. My problem with this game is while it is okay to invest some time in order to solve a problem, there is such a thing as making it too hard to figure out. Right from the first training puzzle, the thing I felt was missing that was not the case in other Zachtronic games was the needed components to construct the solution. Shenzhen IO, TIS/100 and SpaceChem always had enough of the basic elements -- motion, a grabber, and a switch -- to complete the problem. With infinifactory, the grabber -- which in this case would be a clamp -- was missing and it was sorely needed on the third training puzzle where I had to weld a vertical two-block stack, then move the union to the transporter. There was simply no way to join two falling objects at different altitudes into a union and then at command move the union to the transporter. I spent a total of 2 and a half hours on that one puzzle before finally giving up and uninstalling.When something becomes too hard to do, it stops being enjoyable. Infinifactory made the learning curve much too steep at the beginning and I truly feel it should have followed a more shallow incline demonstrated in the other games."
480,2508,"PROS:+The puzzles are challenging, but not to the point where it's frustrating.+The game is well optimized. It starts up EXTREMELY fast and runs smoothly.+The worldwide player statistics system is awesome. It adds a little minor competition that is totally optional.+The gameplay is intuitive and everything works as expected.+Awesome Soundtrack+Steam Workshop.CONS:-The story is pretty bland. It sets a nice premise, but later in the game it's just slightly annoying.-The voice acting isn't great.Over all this game is great if you're looking for some fun logistics problems to solve. It's extremely satisfying when you complete a tough challenge, too. I'd definitely recommend this."
481,2508,Only people with a very high IQ can play this game. I suggest you watch Rick and Morty first.
482,2507,"ladies and gentlemen. presenting the successor to the game that inspired minecraft. T.H.E. voxel-game codifier. this game will make you feel so smart one moment, incredibly stupid the next, make you ragequit in frustration, only to come back and FINALLY finish that stupid thing you wanted to fix!... and then ragequit again when something stupid goes wrong for seemingly no reason whatsoever...this is a great way to get into Zachtronics puzzle games without needing an electronics or programming background."
483,2507,"The game has simple graphics. The first stages of the game teach you how to work out the different components of the puzzles. From there on, the difficulty ramps up pretty quickly, puzzles become very hard and take a long time to complete. For this reason, I stopped playing the game."
484,2506,not my cup of tea
485,2506,"This game puts you in the position of an alien abtuctee that is tasked with manufacturing various constructions from supplied materials for your new masters. Your role is to design and construct the ""factory"" to make each construction. In order to prove that your process works, you must deliver 10 perfect copies of the requested item to a ""scanner"" that validates that each copy delivered is correct. As you progress, you are given additional tools, more challenging conditions/restrictions and more complicated items to assemble. I first learned about this game through a YouTube reference/review from Mark Brown's Game Maker's Tool Kit (search for it and watch it) that put this game in the genre of ""Problem-Solving"" rather than ""Puzzle-Solving"". The distinction is worth noting. This game allows you to develop many potential solutions to each problem - and rates you on the time, moving part and space efficiency of your solution in the form of showing your performance relative to that of all the other Steam players.You have unlimited design time to develop your solutions, and, apart from the final level, there are no practical time limits to how long your solution can take. There's even an achievement (""Subversive Engineering"") for the running time of your (successful) solution being a really long time. Because you learn to use each new element one at a time, I never found the learning curve too intimidatingly steep, and the sense of reward when you solve a problem stage is strong. It is also possible to ""finish"" the game without completing all of the problem scenarios, in case there's one that you are having fits over.  I've put over 150 hours into this game. Not because it's difficult to complete, although some of the campaign puzzles can really stretch your brain, but because I've wanted to ""beat"" the efficiency requirements to get all the achievements and develop better solutions.Although there is Workshop support, I haven't done any of the Workshop levels yet. (I'm trying to work through other games in my library first...)"
486,2505,"I've enjoyed this game a lot, makes you think outside the box, especially when trying to improve designs to get a better score.The initial set of levels are easy, and it wasnt up until the final lot of levels that Ive begun to struggle, a lot. Ive yet to complete the entire game, and I return from time to time in the hope it might click this time around, it usually hasnt.A great game for anyone who enjoys puzzles, there is something here for most, and the workshop opens some challenges to those willing to find even harder levels."
487,2505,I just love it and keep on coming back to it.Great puzzle that always offer multiple possibilities.
488,2504,Fun puzzle mechanics
489,2503,"This is one of the best puzzle games I've played. Even though its individual puzzles take a long time to solve, the satisfaction of creating your own solution makes them worthwhile. Pros:There are numerous methods to finish every puzzlePuzzles are mentally engaging, and often very difficultThe soundtrackThe humor--such as The miners and the hamster pelletsThe failure logs keep you from burning outThe game lets you save an incomplete solution and come back to it later. This helps in the later puzzles where building becomes very time consuming.Cons:Mouse movement can be a bit wonky.Objects fall a little too slowly, and this makes it harder to time falling objects.Overall, I would recommend this game to any person who loves to solve puzzles. It's been a blast so far, and I haven't even finished the game!"
490,2503,"This game is very difficult, so if you're a casual puzzle gamer this may not be for you. The learning curve is steep, expecting you to learn things on the fly and giving you little time to process new concepts. But it is one of the most rewarding puzzle games I've ever played. This is a big step up from SpaceChem, which is also fantastic...they are essentially the same game, but the 3D environment makes it much easier to comprehend and visualize how cycles will play out. Much like SpaceChem, I'll spend ages staring at a problem with no clue how to approach it, then something eventually clicks and I am able to construct a solution. Maybe not an optimized one, but one that works, and the ""leaderboard"" system lets you know how close you are to other players' best solutions. I look forward to getting frustrated as hell at the next Zachtronics game I pick up!"
491,2503,"As far  as I can see the checkpoints are pretty poor on a Mac at least . It is just a waste of time to have to replay huge chunks of the game. However, after playing more the check points are quite good afterall."
492,2502,"I like this game, I really do.The lack of a windowed mode for linux just makes it completely impossible to play, the game starts up on the wrong monitor at the wrong resolution so half of the game isn't visible.This has been an issue since the game came out as far as i know and hasn't been fixed."
493,2501,Pretty good puzzle game that is surprisingly hard
494,2500,"This game is really hard. Soon after the tutorial levelos it gets to the point where it seems to take an hour to fihgure out a puzzle, but when you do figure it out, it feels really good. I want to stress that these are hard puzzles, but they are still fair. You can tell there's a solution to it, you just haven't figured it out yet."
495,2500,Really like this one.  Easy yet challenging.  Good chill out game.
496,2499,"Excellent problem solving game. These are not puzzles in the sense that you have to figure out the correct way to do it, instead you are given a large space to work out one of many solutions, each possibly being better than others in different ways. A factory that works in parallel might go the fastest, but making sure everything doesn't collide means a large footprint. A compact build might be really slow. Apart from a few achievements, it is up to the player to decide which they want to focus on."
497,2499,"This is another one of those ""programming puzzle"" games, one where you can have multiple solutions to each puzzle. And once you do manage to complete the task, you usually find yourself trying to come up with another solution just to make things run more efficiently.Some have called this game ""SpaceChem in 3D"", and I wouldn't say that they're too far off the mark. That third dimension adds enough fun and challenge to an interestingly quirky game."
498,2499,"I like those kinds of puzzle games, but there is no decent tutorial nor do I like the controls. It just feels uncomfortable to solve the puzzles. This game looks like something a single guy made in their spare time. Definately not worth the asking price. Worth maybe 5 bucks but definately not more.If you include cutscene in you game make them either pretty or skippable. :/"
499,2499,"Really incredible puzzling/programming game. New mechanics are introduced at a good pace to keep puzzles interesting and the story (while light and easily ignored) is funny and well-integrated with the puzzles.As a bonus, it runs well even on my dinky Linux laptop with integrated graphics!"
500,2499,Amazing!!!
501,2499,"Liking it so far, yet it crashes sometimes for no reason?"
502,2499,"i liked it, though jus tthe first chapter, Its becomes incredible hard at chapter 2, x3If you like puzzlegames then this one is for you! :D"
503,2499,"A totally unique and immensely deep puzzle game. Honestly unmatched in terms of mechanics and depth; there is never ""one solution"" for a puzzle. Absolutely recommended."
504,2498,"If you liked the building/puzzle aspects of SpaceChem but felt constrained by the limited space, fret no more, Infinifactory is here!  You can build machines as big or small as you want; these machines then take in the input material, whack, chunk, and carve them appropriately, and pass them to the output gateway.  Your creations are rated on size, amount of parts used, and speed, and you can make different solutions for each criteria to try and improve your craftmanship.  There is a backdrop story of being kidnapped by aliens in order to design their factories, just enough to keep you immersed in the fun of construction."
505,2498,"A ""puzzle game"" in which you're not looking for a solution.You're making the solution."
506,2498,A very enjoyable game for those with the patience to learn and understand the mechanics.Though you need to be in the mood of solving puzzles when you play this game.
507,2498,"It is a pretty good game, but it is not what I expected be."
508,2498,A great challenge
509,2498,"Rating: 8.5Highly recommendedInfinifactory is a very challenging but fair 3D puzzle game. The goal is to take the component blocks supplied and construct/deconstruct them as the 'end goal' displays. This game is not unfair, as the only true obstacle between you and completing the puzzle is your own ability to make the production line between point A and point B. While there is one single puzzle from my memory that has 'RNG' applied to it, the rest of the puzzles are predictable and do not throw anything unexpected or unpredictable at you. The puzzles do ramp up in complexity rather fast, but the goal of each puzzle stays the same, only with more blocks added in to the solution. There is no point where you should feel like youre fighting the game to complete a puzzle, and each finished level gave a strong sense of satisfaction.The story isn't remarkable, but not unwelcome. When it comes to puzzle games I don't expect story as I am only there for the challenge the puzzles provide, but what was added to this game felt entertaining enough for me to enjoy. The setting as well adds variety to the environments you work in, changing things up just when the surroundings might start to feel same-y. The art style has a cartoon-y feel to it that I enjoy and has been fairly memorable, but I attribute that more to the unforgettable difficulty the game provides rather than the art style itself. The soundtrack is good, the kind of music that plays in the background and does not distract the player while getting rid of any uncomfortable silence, but is also something nice to listen to when you need to step back from a puzzle and think about it without intense focus.Another small feature that adds to the challenge of the game is the scoreboards of Cycles, how fast you can complete the goal, Footprint, minimizing the area your factory takes up, and Blocks, minimizing the utility blocks added in to your factory. There are no scores by the game that youre expected to beat, but each puzzle shows a chart of scores other users have received on the same puzzle. It adds an extra, but entirely optional, challenge in for you to try and optimize your factory as best as you can.Ironically I have not beaten this game, but this is due to my own shortcomings rather than the game. Despite getting stuck I still have a fair bit of time logged and found the game to be highly addictive. The difficulty near the end is very high, and while I do know the solution exists, my own perfectionism and impatience has made me take a bit of a break from the game. That being said, I still think the game is fantastic and unfortunately very underrated, as there isn't anything I can really complain about when it comes to Infinifactory. Zachtronics knew what they wanted to do, they set out and did it, and everything about it feels right. Come to the game for the puzzle, and enjoy the sci-fi worlds they added in while you're bashing your head on your desk trying to figure out one of the level solutions.The only reason this game is not a 10/10 is because they decided to add in a story that was average, but without the story or variation in level environments, I do not think it would be worth the current price tag."
510,2497,Fantastic.
511,2497,"I'm an electrician who performs electromechanical repairs for factories and I can't tell you how much this resembles my job. I have only played the first 2 levels so maybe I haven't gotten to it yet, but I am waiting for the use of AND/OR logic or even normally closed and normally open circuits (ie. let this pusher block stay extended until an object hits the sensor and lets it close). This makes building the circuits a little longer than I'd like.Difficulty-wise, it's just right. I feel my mind working even though the levels aren't too hard. Someone mentioned the use of computers and I'm assuming Zach's going to use assembly language for it because he seems to like that. I'm going to review this game and put it on YouTube when I've finally completed it. I just got the game today and honestly, I do not regret my purchase.So far, the game gets a 9/10 from me. I wish it were a little more serious and had prettier graphics but those things are optional and do not contribute to the difficulty in this game."
512,2497,"This game does everything I want puzzle games to do. The puzzles make me think in the way that makes me feel it in my head. You can take most of the tools that you've unlocked back to previous puzzles to help solve them more easily. Even the story is good. Also, it's easier than SpaceChem. None of the direct control boss puzzles or anything like that."
513,2497,A mind bender for those that enjoy puzzles :)
514,2496,I'm not a big fan of puzzle games and they don't drag me in like an rpg or a strategy game would. This game however is the exception to that and probably the first puzzle game I've ever finished. My playtime is for finishing the story and then grabbing the last achievements so without a sale it's fairly expensive (23 atm) per hour but damn they're good hours. If you even think you might enjoy this game then I'd highly recommend it.
515,2495,"To start with, the game doesn't seem to offer much, but you just have to push through the first few levels to get used to the controls and figure out how the basic components of a production line work together. After that, you can start to think more creatively about solutions.On each level it is usually frustratingly hard at first to come up with a strategy that will work. You try something to get an idea of the flow of the level and at some point after you've scratched your head and gone back to the drawing board a couple of times, you have a eureka moment. It is very satisfying to hone a machine to peak productivity and compare your results with the efforts of your Steam friends. This game is excellent if you want to be challenged to think logically and creatively. If you have no patience, or don't enjoy puzzles, you should give it a miss."
516,2494,The fact that I can't opt out of the scoreboards in any way makes me feel incredibly uncomfortable and I can't stand to play the game with them present.
517,2493,"Buy this game right now. It dosn't matter who you are, buy it. It's really, really, really good.It is hard though."
518,2490,"Infinifactory is the most approachable of the Zachtronics games. This is the one I recommend to friends.Each level challenges you to build a factory to transform input blocks into the desired output. Factory parts are free, but you can't touch anything while the factory runs. If it works, great! If not, resume factory building and fix the flaw. These puzzles will challenge your skill in timing, sequencing, and 3D geometry. There's a quirky alien abduction story too!After solving each puzzle, the game displays histograms comparing your factory to other players'. I spent many hours tweaking and optimizing my factories to understand how players improved their stats. This optimization challenge is strictly optional."
519,2490,"A great Puzzle-Game with at least 100h of gameplay, and then of course you have a living workshop community :D There is also incitament to aim for more effective solutions, since one can compare ones solutions with the global statistics.Have fun!"
520,2489,Great game! Very good for people who like building or puzzles. It has a nice difficulty scaling and the steam workshop keeps the fun going.
521,2489,"A must-have game for problem-solvers and engineer-types.In the game, you design factories to build various finished products needed by your alien captors.  The levels introduce new ideas in a gradual way, and then build on those ideas with more and more challenging levels.  There is no ""right"" way to solve a level, which allows you to be creative and to try out different ideas.  You can also compare your solution to others' via a few metrics to see how your solution stacks up.I found the levels to have a massive amount of replay value.  I enjoyed iterating on solutions to streamline them, looking at other peoples' solutions on youtube for inspiration, and revisiting older levels when I was a more advanced player.  And, even if you do beat the game and solve every level with maximum efficiency, there are user-created Steam Workshop levels which introduce even more new ideas and challenges.The game also has a light but coherent story, a sense of humor, and is fairly polished.Infinifactory is also much bigger than you think it is.  Just when you think you have beaten the game, an entire second campaign is unlocked, with a ton of new levels, a lot of new and interesting ideas, and builds on the story in a satisfying way.Some people have mentioned the ""physics"" of this game.  The engine has what I call ""Game of Life"" physics, by which I mean:  All the blocks are constrained to a grid, and a block can only move one square per cycle.  It's very intuitive when you play it, but it is definitely not ""real life"" physics.A+, 10/10, one of my favorite games."
522,2487,10/10
523,2486,"A puzzle gem, for all of us having an erection looking at one beautiful and optimized assembly line"
524,2485,"Infinifactory is about making use of building blocks provided by your alien bosses to build mechanisms that achieve results required for each scenario. So far (15 hours in), I found that objectives will either involve assembling multiple copies of some gizmo from scratch, or modifying/upgrading pre assembled gizmos that show up.The game lets you loose without a lot of hand holding, which means there is a learning curve which people may respond differently to. You will know if you are adjusting well to that curve if you find yourself getting inspiration from what you did in prior scenarios, as you naturally develop your own arsenal of small solutions or sub-mechanisms. On the other hand, things are probably bad if you find yourself completely stomped and overwhelmed at each scenario with no idea on how to start.I would agree with those who say this is like Spacechem in 3D. If you haven't played that one, I highly recommend it. I found Infinifactory easier, but maybe that's because Spacechem has  somewhat conditioned me on how to think about solutions.Overall I find this is a great game. Kudos to Zach Barth (the author?) for promptly responding to my support request."
525,2485,"If you like puzzles and optimization, this is the game for you."
526,2485,Great puzzle game. Feeling of finally getting your solution working is very satisfying. Part of fun for me is watching other people elegant solutions to puzzles i just finished on youtube - it's crazy how creative those guys are!Btw this game is nothing like Portal which has only one way to solve each puzzle.
527,2485,"Very fun and satisfies my autism. Ironically, it's not very well optimised and I'd recommend using Process Lasso or something similar to get a decent framerate."
528,2485,"Avesome game, love it!"
529,2484,boring
530,2484,I wish I could play this game forever
531,2484,Minecraft + PortalHurts my brain10/10
532,2484,Yep.
533,2483,"I was already a fan of Zachtronics games, but this one is my new favorite by far. More intuitive than the rest, and maybe a little easier on average - and I mean that in a good way. This one isn't quite as exacting as SpaceChem or TIS-100.Very satisfying to perfect your solutions and see your creations in motion. I think I can actually beat this one!"
534,2483,"Great puzzle game.My brain is not particularly designed for puzzle logic games but when I finally find the solution to a level, it feels so good and rewarding!I liked SpaceChem but I loved this game, great job team!"
535,2483,SpaceChem in 3D.
536,2483,"Really wish I could recommend this, but I really can't say I had fun the entire time playing. I might be the wrong type of person for this game, so if you enjoy puzzles that make you think really hard, this might be fun. If you don't enjoy spending longer than 20 minutes on a single challenge, I can't recommend this."
537,2483,"Perhaps the best puzzle game I've played to date.  Other than the creative ways you can come up with to solve, the story actually becomes very interesting... without giving much away, if you play through long enough you start to see it unfold.  Worth."
538,2483,"I feel  as though I've missed something playing this game as I can't complete any of the puzzles without cheating. On top of this, I feel like I couldn't have completed them on my own as I never would have figured out the trick to the solution on my own. The audio has been increadibly buggy throughout so I have to play it on mute all the time. I would refund it if it wasn't for the fact I've played it for more than four hours trying to get past the tutorial.P.S 21:9 support is great."
539,2483,"An amazing game, has lots o diversity from other puzzle games. Very fun and challenging for everyone. Great game, lots of great moments, Absolutely nothing negitive. 1000/10!"
540,2483,"The satisfaction you feel from solving the simple, yet fiendishly tricky puzzles is what makes this game amazing. The options available to you to achieve the goals are sufficiently steep."
541,2483,Fun puzzles but unnecessarily miserable story. Would rather not have listened to a dog die of loneliness.
542,2483,good idea. bad quality.
543,2483,Very challenging. Great game.
544,2483,"As someone coming from games like Factorio, redstone in Minecraft, or things like TIS 100, Infinifactory scratches that itch perfectly. You know, the itch to optimize. The itch to improve. The itch to hack together an abomination of a machine and laugh maniacally as you watch your frankenstein of a factory actually work."
545,2483,---Infinifactory---A strategy and a puzzle game that will make you think about what's going on.I recommend this game for everyone who likes unknown feelings.
546,2483,"Best ever!! If you like Space Chem, you'll definitely like this game!!"
547,2483,"I really like this game. If you like puzzle games and logic thinking this is for you! Only warning i would give is that its a steep curve, definately not the easiest puzzle game, but thats a positive thing imho."
548,2483,"A really superb puzzle game, Infinifactory takes the basic structure of Zachtronic's previous game SpaceChem and expands it both into the third dimension, and in the variety of tools at your disposal.Infinifactory is a surprisingly well paced game, which keeps things fresh by introducing new mechanics on a regular basis, and has ""pallet cleanser"" levels after the particularly difficult puzzles which have you do some rather silly and somewhat macharbre things."
549,2482,"I can only half recommend this game.  I fully recommend it as a puzzle game, but I can't recommend it as a physics-based puzzle game.As a puzzle game, it's got a lot going for it:  it's challenging without being too difficult (so far), it's logic-based, the controls are mostly intuitive, and it's even got sort of a story/lore with some decent humor.However, this game must take place in some alternate universe where the laws of physics aren't applied evenly, and that bugs me.  Since you're scored on how many blocks you use for your solution (with fewer blocks being better), you often have to come up with solutions to the puzzles that would not work in real life to get a good score.  For instance, if you need to make a structure that is three blocks wide, you only need to support one of those blocks with a conveyor belt, and it doesn't matter which one.  That means you could have a conveyor under the leftmost block with nothing supporting the middle or right blocks, and the whole thing will keep moving along the conveyor as though the center of mass is supported when it clearly isn't.  That diminishes the game somewhat for me, but I realize that's a personal preference and that not everybody will care about that, hence the split recommendation."
550,2481,"It's a mix of Portal and SpaceChem, for people who like Factorio, presented through a blocky Minecraft like medium.How the hell can you not love that?"
551,2481,"Who are your mysterious alien overlords, what do they have you building?!  I bought this game a while ago but never quite got around to playing it.. it's actually pretty fun.  Like all Zachtronics games I love the (morsels of) mysterious story that unfolds as you progress.. and the puzzles do increase in complexity / fun if you stick with it.  The beginning was a little boring at first and I had my doubts.. but I'd recommend this game.  The real fun is in insane solutions, stacking push blocks upon push blocks, having sections of the machine slide out or drop off, anything goes!"
552,2480,"+ Challenging puzzles+ Good controls+ Challenging puzzles+ Good music+ Challenging puzzles+ Comedy, but also death+ Challenging puzzles+ Nice difficulty curve, so instead of feeling like an idiot after 5 minutes, you feel like an idiot after 30 minutes- I'll never finish this game9/10 pretty good"
553,2480,"It has some of the best puzzle gameplay I've ever seen on a Steam game. It's unique with design and items. I've only gotten through some of the levels, but that's enough to know that I'll be keeping this game. I really do recommend this game to anybody who really likes head-scratching puzzles. This game makes you think. Hard."
554,2480,Surprisingly great.21 out of 23.
555,2479,More challenging than portal. Also has lasting gameplay.
556,2478,"I always loved the idea of building a massive factory with conveyors, pistons, turntables, welders, and other things. I was a weird kid. But this game lets me do just that, and while it wants you to use as little parts as possible, i always build the most extravagant factory i can."
557,2478,"It's a Zachtronics game...I mean, look at other Zachtronic titles. Their bars are pretty high, especially Shenzhen I/O and TIS-100. You need to know how to code/how to build circuits.INFINIFACTORY IS DIFFERENT. It's more approachable. You don't need to know how to code. You just build things and the function of each kind of building block is clear enough. As long as you have the ability to think, you can solve the puzzles.After playing other Zachtronic Titles: I'm so stupid and good at nothing(?)After INFINIFACTORY: I can build things? That's fantastic.The background is interesting enough and pretty funnyIf you like intellectual challenges, this is for you!"
558,2478,"Awesome game.I love how there are so many different ways to approach the puzzles, with very differernt solutions.Many of the puzzles are brain twisters for sure."
559,2478,"Great puzzles! Most of them are doable relatively quickly, but you then get to optimize them to your heart's content. 35 hours  in and I only now finished the Overlord campaign. The rest has yet to be played. Fun!"
560,2477,Great factorys.
561,2477,"Game crashes after 5-10 minutes, bringing up a prompt to open a webpage, which then immediatley closes the chosen browser. Looking through the discussion forum, the only solution seems to be putting up with the crashes and making manual save backups, or disabling your antivirus and any cloud backup software you have.Great game, just a shame that this clearly ongoing problem has been allowed to persist."
562,2477,"Quite a nice game, a bit lacking on information early on, but otherwise a nice time killer.The crashing issue was patched October 2018, and thus I'm changing the review to a positive one. Original review as follows:However I cannot recommend this game due to some minor bugs the developer has declined to resolve.(Any transient IO issues will cause the game to crash the game, such as an anti virus scan or cloud provider accessing the savegame)"
563,2477,This is an engaging and increasingly difficult puzzle game. The best part of it though is watching your creation in action. Each solution will be some form of assembly line and watching it operating is mesmerizing and more importantly satisfying as that chain of operations is something you built. Even if it's messy it's yours.
564,2477,A game for people who love thinking and finding elegant solutions. Extremely interesting puzzles. Conveyor verson of Portal 2. With much more challenging tasks. Love it!
565,2477,Kinda like SpaceChem but in 3d with blocks and you build stuff
566,2476,"Enjoy building machines and watching them go? Have fun solving puzzles and hearing recordings of the poor souls that lie dead near said puzzles?Infinifactory has you covered! Its an enjoyable game with some very challenging stages that have tons of different solutions to each puzzle, allowing you to test your creative and problem solving skills."
567,2476,Like puzzles and factories? Then this is for you.
568,2476,I made a floating factory where nothing touches the ground. Doing this makes it so that you can move around modules if your factory to parts where they are needed. I have literally ONE welding module and TWO movement modules that move the blocks to where they need to go.10/10 would not make floating factory again too hard
569,2475,"Do you like building complex machine-like solutions to problems? Get this and ""SpaceChem""Both extremely fun games for people who like solving puzzles"
570,2473,"I don't think any other game gives this much satisfaction after finishing a level. Really incredible and very challenging 3d puzzle game. There's even a story behind it which I found very amusing and very well made. (+ the graphics and looks are perfect, amazing atmosphere)I bought it in summer sales at -50% and it's definitly worth it (even at full price I'd say), there are alot of puzzles (I finished the complete campaign in 69 hours) and you can make your own or download community made puzzles from the steam workshop."
571,2471,A very good game.
572,2471,This is my favorite game right now. It's amazing!
573,2470,"Great learning curve, easy at the beggining yet really challenging afterwards. Graphics and mechanisms are great. I don't see any real cons. This game worths its price imo, one of my favourite puzzle game."
574,2468,"Good engineering puzzle fun times to be had. Really flexible system gives many different ways to accomplish tasks, it's up to you to find your own style and make something work. Good depth to be found in optimisation challenges and trying to beat friends and the wider community.The tools are limited to begin with, but expand quite a bit as you progress (and often you'll find yourself wishing you had a certain something only to later get it)Some small things missing that get a little frustrating (why can't welders/sensors also point up instead of down for instance) but overall good times to be had.If you liked engineering/tech mods in minecraft and the like, definitely a game for you."
575,2468,"If you liked space chem, you'll love this too!It's a fantastic game all about optomising, testing, failing and failing again!Sometimes you hack together a solution that makes no sense, but it works... kind of... but what matters is that it does the job - Just like making software in the real world!I would also recommend playing with subtitles as they can be fairly funny for the sound effects sometimes"
576,2468,"This game is so frustrating, but I love it"
577,2468,"This game felt bland. When yous tart up the game, you start with a confusing tutorial and then progress to some form of a story line element. I had no idea what was going on with the story. The puzzles were allright but it would be nice if there was some kind of prompt for some of the puzzles, something to get you thinking. The graphics weren't that good eiether for a game released in 2015.Overall, the game added nothing to the puzzle genre and it doesn't really have a selling point or something that would amke it stand out from other games. It had good potential and I could see how it could lay out but it just wasn't executed in a way that I liked."
578,2468,It's a neat little puzzle game. Focuses you to be creative and build your own solution not just the one the dev intended. The physics engine is rudimentary but it gets the job done.
579,2468,One of the best puzzle games I've played. Really challenging and great replay value.
580,2467,"Beautiful logistic puzzle game with, to be clear, no survival gameplay. Great in small doses.Definite get when on sale, since $25 seems way too high"
581,2467,One of the best examples of game design to date
582,2466,This one is for the most intelligent of nerds. It challenges your analytic capabilities in a most pleasant way.
583,2466,This is what Minecraft prepared me for!(sans the aliens)
584,2466,"This is a fantastic example of a problem-solving puzzle game.  If you're familiar with Zachtronics' other titles and liked them at all, stop wasting your time reading this and run-do-not-walk to the ""buy"" button.If you're not familiar with the genre or the other titles, let me put it like this: you're building a factory.  You get some collection of stuff in, and some tools (conveyor belts, welders, etc) which you arrange into a production line to build a specific requested product.  You have essentially infinite freedom for what to build, and the _first_ puzzle is figuring out how to make what you want.  Then things get a little OCD.Every solution you build to a puzzle is scored on three factors: how fast you solved it, how many pieces you used, and how ""big"" your solution was (for a measure of bigness that is not worth trying to define here.)  And it shows you how well yours scored compared to other users who have played the game.  Even if you're not the competitive type, it's awfully hard not to look at the fact that someone else solved it in half the time, think ""That's impossible!  Well maybe if I..."" and look up 4 hours later from the ruins of your civilization to realize that you are now addicted to this game.  Often times optimizing your solution one way will make it hilariously inefficent according to one of the other two scoring factors, so you'll end up solving the same problem many times.The game is also set in a quirky-but-dark setting with a nice touch of humour.  It doesn't impose on the gameplay much (yet) but it does add a nice tone.  The interface is quick and intuitive.  The music and art assets are well-done, and the support is nothing short of phenomenal - I emailed Zachtronics with an issue and got a response from the developer within minutes (not that you should expect that every time, but I was still impressed... especially since the issue was actually User Error.)Thanks Zach!  Great game!"
585,2466,"Amazing and addictive puzzle game. I have played several other Zachtronics games before, so I knew this would be hard, but it is not as hard as I feared. I have played it about 20 hours now and I am through most of the first campaign, but I know that there is more to come and it will get more difficult. So far I had very few moments of frustration, though I had to take a break sometimes and think about a problem. I never felt the need to use online solutions, though it might be helpful to look at some of the user guides with some tips and tricks. In contrast to other Zachtronics games, I felt that the levels are quite large, so there is a lot of room for unelegant solutions, which still do the job.Due to the 3D the game is much more immersive than other Zachtronics games and I like that it feels like you are constructing factories to manufacture actual stuff, like spaceships, tanks and packaged meat. It runs very smoothly on my non-gaming notebook, looks pretty enough and the backgrounds are gorgeous. The music is nice and not distracting, good for long periods of concentration. The story or setting reminded me of ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"". It is funny and bizarre, but also sad at times. I really makes me want to know how it continues and I actually care for some of the characters (Floyd). However, I cannot judge how it will be in the later part of the game.In the game you get different inputs and have to build a factory to create something as an output (for example a Sattelite). Otherwise you are given total freedom, so you can get really creative and in the end you are really proud of your own, personal solution. It is not a puzzle game in the sense that there is a predefined solution that you have to find, which is what I like about Zachtronics games. The puzzles (at least in the first campaign) feel all quite different, so it does not get repetitive. In some way it is like programming, because you can use sensors for kind of ""if then"" instructions: ""If there is a block at this position, active that pusher in that other location"". But you don't have to be a programmer, it is just some logic thinking. It's fun.For the moment I will stop playing this game because I have an exam soon, which is why I am doing the review now. But this will take me some effort, I really want to continue playing it."
586,2466,"This game is like the standard Zachtronic's game, only in three dimensions. It's fun, and the variety of puzzles means you won't get frustrated or stuck on a level."
587,2466,"This is a fun puzzle game. Good balance of simple mechanics and the possibility of complex combinations. Very creative challenges, fun little story in between some levels, and lots of levels!"
588,2466,It gaem dun make me feel liek me am smert. 9/0
589,2466,this game makes me do wookie noises...would chewbacca again!
590,2466,"I loved SpaceChem, so I expected I would enjoy this game too. I wasn't wrong. Infinifactory is, simply put, SpaceChem in 3D. Pros+ Challenging Gameplay+Finishing levels gives a great sense of satisfaction+The audio logs are very interestingCons-Game doesn't seem to know quite what its tone is supposed to be. The times when you interact with the aliens are funny and goofy, but the audio logs you find on the bodies of your predecessors are pretty dark and haunting. There's even a  dead dog  within the first few levels. The uneven tone of the game doesn't take away from the gameplay, but I wish they had gone either serious or silly all the way/-Visually, not great. The visuals seem pretty utilitarian in their purpose. They show what you need to see with no bells and whistles. Lighting isn't great, either.-Music gets old fast, especially when spending a long time on a level. I usually play my own music unless I find one of the audio logs.In spite of the cons I've listed, I would still highly reccomend it. The gameplay is just so incredibly good that it makes up for the other shortcomings.9/10"
591,2464,"I'm sorry, I can't bear seeing this game with a ""Mixed"" recent review.Ignore the barely-literate negative reviews. This game is spectactular. It's the best puzzle game I've ever played in my life, although perhaps it's more accurate to call it an ""Engineering"" game instead. Stages are open-ended tasks using a few simple block types, and you're scored on how well your solution performs across a number of categories.If you have the slightest interest in automation or problem-solving games, you should definitely pick this up. Enormous amount of value for the price. Just don't be confused by the superficial similarities to Minecraft."
592,2464,"Not very exciting, all you do is look around and build things"
593,2463,"If you like logical puzzles, then you will probably like this. To be honest I would suggest Factorio over this, becuase you get the same logical production feature without having to deal with the gameplay and UI of Infinifactory"
594,2463,"A nice puzzle game. Nothing spectacular, but well worth it. I feel like the developers wasted a chance to make a more immersive experience if they removed the option menu where you select the puzzles, and replaced that with some kind of mini level or teleport. Perhaps a small computer console standing next to the teleport would allow you to select the level to play. The way it is currently, I'm constantly reminded that I'm playing a game.Anyway, thumbs up for good puzzles which is the main reason I got it."
595,2463,Really fun puzzle game. Difficulty scales well and I found myself spending a ton of time on the later puzzles. Workshop is great to have as well.
596,2463,Sick
597,2461,"I thought this game was a puzzler, but it really doesn't play like one. Really pretty disappointed overall."
598,2460,"good puzzle solving game. I find this much preferable to the aimless block-world concepts i see. There's an actual problem and you need to solve it. I love trying novel solutions optimized for different criteria. Later on, this does get ridiculous and some of the builds get much harder to complete."
599,2460,"This game is all about visual factory logistics using an inventory of blocks that you use to manipulate the materials given to you. You use these materials in wild manners to construct some pretty intense mini assembly lines.Learning curve is really gradual. You slowly work up to the really difficult puzzles in good pace. UI/controls/building is really easy. Very similar to some factory minecraft mods in a way, just much more complicated in function :D I feel that vive/vr support could make this game even more interesting too.There is A LOT of content if you want to finish all puzzles possible with a lot of room to optimize where you wish with what you learn in later campaigns.So if you like visual puzzles in which you interact in a FPS manner this is one of THE best games for it.GET IT! :D"
600,2460,"OverviewReally fun and interesting puzzle game with familiar yet somewhat unique mechanics.The player takes the role of a human who has been abducted by an alien spaceship and is tasked with constructing a variety of different production lines (for lack of a better term) to make equipment and machines for the aliens across a variety of levels. The player will unlock more machine parts and mechanics as they progress.The games interesting story is initially told through tape recordings that the player will find in different levels.The levels seemingly easy but quickly get more difficult as the game progresses. There are many different ways in which to construct the different production lines in each stage and the player is rewarded for making their factory as efficient as possible. This game is sure to frustrate any player but they will be rewarded for their determination.This game has elements from, and can be compared to, other games such as Factorio and Minecraft, but it is also very different from those games in other ways and is more than capable of being considered independent from those games.Positive Aspects+Fun and interesting puzzle mechanics.+Excellent soundtrack.+Freedom to solve puzzles in different ways, with more efficient ways being rewarded.+Good story, however, the story does not at first have a central role in the game.+Very relaxing, yet difficult gameplay. (opinion)+Workshop support for creating new levels.+Nice aesthetic.+Good learning curve.+Longer that it seems. The player will unlock a whole new set of missions involving solving puzzles for a rebel alliance when the main story appears to be complete.Neutral Aspects~Online functionality limited to leaderboards and the workshop.~No performance issues.Negative Aspects-Levels may get repetitive after a while.-Players may get bored of the game's mechanics.-Some players may not like the games linear progression.-Price is perhaps slightly too high.ConclusionOverall, I like this game. I would recommend this game to anybody who likes puzzle games. It is a very good puzzle game and it is relaxing and fun to play. The game will require alot of determination to complete and I would not recommend it to people who are looking for an easy game or to those who are not interested in puzzles."
601,2460,It is not what you think this game is actually really boring and crappy
602,2459,"Incredible game that makes you feel like a production line designer. The best part of playing this game are the ""Eureka!"" moments you get when you figure out an answer to a problem.If you think the game looks too hard for you, give it a try, the game kind-of hold your hand during the tutorial while still leting you experiment."
603,2458,"You feel like you're not only solving a puzzle but more than that, you're building stuff! And building stuff is so cool. Each stage presents itself as a completely new challenge that when you solve it you'll feel like you got a little bit smarter. It was the first 3D puzzle that I've played that I was actually actually needing to think in three dimensions and taking time and order into consideration, trial and error will not take you any far.Play it!"
604,2457,"The perfect game to explain/teach the principles of classic programming... and have fun while learning them. If it were not for some ""mature"" elements in the story, I would recommend to include it into junior/middle school curricula.Ah! And remember that you can use the Z key to undo actions (and Y to redo them)."
605,2457,trash
606,2456,Needs a rewind button BIGLY
607,2456,"I like what i refer to as logistics games, and i gain immense satisfaction watching all the little bits working together as a whole. This is a puzzle game, but there aren't set solutions but numerous ways to achieve success.You take various machine parts and put them together in a minecraft style world. You have an input and an output and most puzzles require assembling things and sending them off.I have unlocked all the puzzles and completed many of them but some i am still struggliing with a solution for, this is one of those games that you think about whilst doing something else, only to return later with renewed vigor to solve the puzzle you were stuck on."
608,2456,"10/10  - This game is amazing.  One of the best games I've ever played. If you enjoy logical thinking and trying to solve a problem, get this game immediately. Build items using conveyer belts, welders, pushers, sensors and an array of other components. And when you've solved a level, spend more time optimising it later because it's just so satisfying.Damn."
609,2455,"When I loaded the game and realized it was made by the same people that made Spacechem I knew I was already in love. 20 hours into the campaign so far with plenty left to do! Plus the steam workshop has some awesome challenges! If you think ""atyppicaly"" for solving problems then this is your game.Oh and also cudos to the team for that delightful nod to genders. It really made the game that much more worth getting to that point. Never before has a game been actually on par with what I has a transwoman could for as humor. That got me laughing then crying once I realized so few might get the joke. So again thank you.Sorry to do a second edit... but I mean what more do you want from this game other than someone to tell you more about it because of how much they enjoyed it? The soundtrack is so nice and relaxing that it actually feels like it makes you solve the problem faster and more efficiently. 10/10 would buy again... but please no... Im poor... Soundtrack was worth the extra buy tho..."
610,2455,"A wonderful puzzle game that can be very difficult to get your head around, but figuring out a working solution is as satisfying as getting a solution almost right but missing one tiny detail which forces you to restart the whole thing is infuriating."
611,2454,"This is not your typical puzzle game. It's much better than that. There are no proper ""solutions"" like most puzzle games. You will only be limited by your own ingenuity and skill in creating your own unique solutions. Fantastic, 10/10, would factory again."
612,2454,"Good game with a lot of value, but the price is a bit high so I would recommend getting whenever it's on sale."
613,2454,"great game, randomly deleted everything.0/10 im angry."
614,2454,Best first person puzzle game not named Portal. It's like if Valve took away your portal gun and gave you Minecraft redstone.
615,2453,"It can be really challenging, but like most puzzles you get better as you play. I found it was pretty fun and enjoyed the game for the few days I spent playing. I would recommend it as it is one of the better types of these games out there."
616,2452,One of the best puzzle games i've played. Its a must try!!!
617,2452,"Okay.  Well It's the first day.  I'm over 12hours in.  Just kinda of a random buy on the Steam Holiday Winter Sale.  Saw that it has pretty good reviews and most off comments were basically from people who either were gifted the game and they weren't into it or it's being labled as too difficult.  Neither comments I don't get.  If you were gifted the game and didn't like it because it's not your thing, why go write a bad review?  I don't like lots of games, I don't go finding their pages and writing bad reviews for them.  As for it being too hard.  C'mon.  Keep trying.  It's great for creative thinking.  I was on a puzzle for over 4hours but finally got it.  I ended up starting over the puzzle and re-thought my strategy and got it.  It's a great little gem."
618,2452,good gaem.bye
619,2452,"My favorite part of Zachtronics games is the feeling of moving tangible objects in the game world. That's what elevates it above awkward programming for me. Out of the Zachtronics games I've played, Infinifactory captures this aspect best.The workshop integration also adds a lot of value. The built-in puzzle design, as in all Zachtronics games, tends to favor big-and-messy puzzles as the game progresses, and I'm more a fan of small-and-clean puzzles. Many of the workshop puzzles offer this sort of design, in particular Aap op Sokken's ""Way Too Fast"" series.Compared to 2D Zachtronics games, it is less challenging to complete puzzles in Infinifactory because having 3 dimensions available means you are less space constrained. Those looking for pure difficulty may be disappointed, but for me the increased immersion makes up for it."
620,2452,A puzzle game that actually made me think. It also kept me thinking after I've quit the game up until the point where I've figured the answer out to a puzzle so that I relaunch the game. It's neat!

I thought the concept was really cool, and the gameplay looked smoothe, but I didn't really pay very much mind to it after that. Until it showed up one day in my dicovery queue, and, being the curious person that i am, I picked it up at it's Christmas sale price.I was completely blown away by just how fun this game is. Creating large assebmly lines and factories and watching all the small storage units come through from a nice top down view, or witnessing the creation that you spent hours on make a tiny mistake somewhere in the middle and fall apart with storage crates piling up and falling off cliffs due to your small error, and then procceding to pick apart your assembly line piece by piece to find that tiny little mistake.On top of this amazing ""create-> test-> fail-> change-> succeed"" style gameplay, there is a dark, but still somewhat goofy plot, that made me shed some tears in the early game. The unnerving corpses that litter each level, each one holding the last recorded audio log before they failed their task. This game brought me right up to my screen with so many different emotions. And, dare I say it... The dog. Being an overall animal lover, and an owner of a dog myself, witnessing the horrors that lie in that one level brought me to tears the moment I picked up that audio log, and really brought to light the horrific acts commited by the games antagonists.9/10"

628,2451,"Really great game, I recommend it to everyone that love to build intricate machines, it is always amazing when you finish a build to see it building the serie of products flawlessly, especially when you spent hours to design and tweak the mechanism.The gameplay is rock solid and allows to do all sorts of non standard and creative mechanisms, like having separate structure with welders that floats in the air or using blocks in a circular treadmill to act as a clock. It seems some options have been disabled to make the puzzles harder and more interesting, for example, there are not upward welder so you always need to find a more complicated way to make it work.The game is actually very long, when you think you finished the game, you discover you only made half of it (there are two campaigns). I realized that I spent more time on this game than on Witcher 3, that says a lot.However I find the puzzles become too big and complicated at the end, so I don't even bother to try a better solution, which was the most interesting thing for me.

It is a bit like space chem, but it has a lot of the really annoying things that make this overall way more frusturating:1. Welders are SO ANNOYING!!! they can't be turned off, so you have to be more careful with them then bonders in Spacechem.2. lack of vertical transport. If it ever shows up, I got too frusturated early on to get to it. If the input and output are on the same level, it's essentially 2D3. lack of story.
