1,2750,"The game is very good learning material. The bugs in the game make you spend even more time on a diagram and when you try to learn something new then it's actually positive. All the explanations for logic components are very good. I will probably use this game as a reference in the future if I have to refresh my memory on these topics.I read from the forum that developers are planning to rewrite the game to make it even better. I will sure buy it again. The current price is a steal for such great information that is put together as the engineering books are usually either dry and/or expensive.Thank you Pb Studio developers, I love it!!!UPDATE!A Calculator level is unbeatable as the test seems to be buggy - There is only one interrupt fired at step 12 and that's it, the rest of the steps the input data does not change . So you can not finish the game, which is very unfortunate as I still think it has been such great learning experience so far"
2,2745,"The lack of a ""mixed"" review option is a problem again... This is a pretty great game that kind of bridges the distance between stuff like Zachtronics games, and ""real"" hardware engineering, from simple logic gates to microchips.  Think of it as one step beyond Shenzhen I/O, where you have to wire individual input and output pins. I have no formal education in computer science or any kind of engineering, and still greatly enjoyed it.However, it's unfinished, unpolished, and abandoned. The game is online only for no good reason (the dev wanted to produce a version for tablets and phones that would require online to run properly, but that never happened) and, probably in part because of that, the game doesn't run nearly as smoothly as it should. I would love to see the game improved and completed, but it's been abandoned since 2016, so odds seem incredibly low.For 5.69 CAD, I'd still recommend it to anyone interested. The game is janky, but it's got a fair bit of content and is genuinely unique, in that I've never seen any other game bridge the gap between Zachlikes and ""real"" engineering in that way, although maybe there are professional products that might do the same."
3,2730,"Don't Buy, The game isn't even finished and they took the website down and the game can't be played!"
4,2729,"Such a shame about this game, however for quite a few years now the developers keep quoting that an overhaul of the engine is required and yet no progress has been made. Interesting concept, but fails to deliver anything of substance in its current state."
5,2717,"I like the game , the idea and ofc what it brings.But as an alpha it misses stuff and design is a bit cheap? Also i love the fact we can program our own stuff but at the same time the api miss of friendlyness.I love stuff like thinkercad, but we caint design our own chip.Hmmm it's hard the concept is good , the thing is ultra promising it is not ready to be published i think.I will be a  i will get a refund...I hope developer still on it , it deserve attention and funds.I give a 5/10 , 5 point that belongs to the conceptual and application of the product.To get another five point , gameplay, game design or any related to those two example will need to be completed.I keep it in my library crossing my finger to further developpement.For the moment i don't recommended as a playable game, but as an investor you can see where the thing is going. I give a thumb up and wish that my money and everyone else dont finish in a dead end without seeing a 1.0."
6,2715,"If this game is finished, it will be very fun and I'll probably lose countless hours enjoying it. As it is currently, the interface is too unfinished for me to find it fun, and the developer's most recent update that I can find is that they ""hope to revive this one day"", so I'm not going to hold my breath for an update anytime soon. Maybe I'll be pleasantly surprised?"
7,2714,"The best game about engineering. I started playing this game as a practice simultaneously reading Harris & Harris book. Game starts with a quick revision of gates with some tasks. After that, adders, substraction, multiplexers, ALU, memory. Dreams of a hardware engineer came true in this game9.7 / 10-0.3 because of inconvenience in making circuits. It is better to use square highlight rather than click on every wire to delete. Also it is very hard to translate part of circuit to another place. Please provide an ability to use square higlight!"
8,2654,"Its a nice concept. It is very similar to MHRD, but still lacks a lot in terms of execution. The following things I noticed - 1. The wires bend as they please and get connected to random points, there is no way to control how they are drawn.2. The testcases are run one by one. It is just a tedious process and does not add any value. Also, each testcase takes quite a few seconds for some reason, they would be instantaneous. 3. The text may appear too small, should be able to adjust the text size.4. The steps are too large, you can only play it if you already know about half and full adders etc. Sort of beats the purpose of the game."
9,2654,"Conceptually, this game could be great fun and teach people the essence of digital circuitry at the same time. However, in the current state, I simply cannot recommend playing this game, and sadly I do not expect this to change soon either.Almost all of the gameplay consists of the following: interpreting instructions, then dragging a whole bunch of components into the workspace, connect these with wires, and then test whether the solution works. There is nothing wrong with this, but there are so many basic features lacking that this soon becomes a tiresome business. A few examples: Components are visibly sluggish when moving/dragging them around. Once drawn, lines cannot be moved, and any adjustments have to be made by removing the existing line, and then redrawing the line section. Lines and components cannot be selected as groups. This means that if you want to move a certain section of your circuitry, you have to manually move every single line and component. The same is true for removing. When you move a component, every connected line disengages, requiring you to redraw the lines again. This is such a looming issue that it was faster for me to try out concepts on paper, rather than try them in the in-game sandbox. Inputs cannot be manually toggled (set to True/False), which means that partial circuitry cannot be tested as you are building it. This is essentially the experience you would get whilst drawing the circuits manually on paper. This however is a game where the meat and potatoes of the gameplay is literally building and testing circuits, so I would expect the tools to be on par with for example the CircuitVerse sandbox.  I have a few bones to pick with the instructions/objectives as well, or specifically, with their accessibility. They are displayed in a tiny window off to the side, and you have to constantly switch between pages using small buttons. However, the size of the window changes as you are switching between tabs, meaning it becomes a bothersome minigame just to access the instructions.There is more to mention, but I will leave it at this. The resulting experience just isn't particularly fun or engaging, and takes a lot longer than it has to. The interface is so clunky that I would rather just read the objectives, fire up LTspice or CircuitVerse and make the circuits there (because the actual problem solving IS a lot of fun!). I could have overlooked these issues if they were early access issues that would be ironed out as development proceed. But I am seeing reviews from over four years ago describing the same issues that I encountered. I therefore see no precedent that these issues will be addressed in the future, and it seems likely that the current state of this game is as good as it is going to get. And that simply is not good enough."
10,2651,"Probably isn't fair to give a review while in Alpha still, but this game jumps in theory and technology way too quickly. Some of the lessons aren't very clear and some of the parts aren't well labeled (such as inputs and outputs with multiple bits needing to label which in the LMB and MSB is at). Terms like LMB and MSB are used well before they are even defined. Scoring does not always make sense either. You can score lower using a solution with only one component (other than ins & outs) than you might get with 4 components. Some problems don't logically make sense (truth tables are incomplete). For example, a circuit to open a bus door can open the door even without true inputs. I've posted individual bug reports, but for now there is just too much work to be done. Visually, you can't even tell what a component is without hovering your mouse over it. If your input is a digit, you get a D but 3 different digital inputs all look the same."
11,2643,"Fun game but also difficult, I'm more into the software side of things but I'm also tired so that's my excuse for being bad. I did run into a bug when I middle clicked on a component in the list and then tried to move them around on the main area but I just reloaded the game."
12,2637,complicated but like most things put the time in and study it and your golden.
13,2636,"I can not recommend this game in it's current state.After a couple levels, components stopped functioning correctly, the testing phase stopped working ( froze ), and I could not save my circuit.  I did managed to 'save' one of my circuits ... it did not load correctly, and had many wires and components missing .I also have no clue how to move the map around to create more complex circuits ( I pushed all the buttons on my keyboard and mouse ) . I really like the idea behind this logic game, but as it is, it's a buggy mess that is frustrating to play .I've also noted a few logic errors in some of the instructions for the circuit designs ."
14,2626,Teaches what classes can't.
15,2622,.
16,2620,"Game crashed by changing the background. Also only works with an active internet connection. For such a simple game, requiring an internet connection seems really big brother."
17,2617,"In it's current state, I do NOT recommend buying this game. It is very buggy, and there are many broken parts in the game. One of the components flat out had a ""burned out pin"" for whatever reason, and made it harder to troubleshoot the problem when I couldn't complete the level. (I forgot to clarify this is not supposed to happen to my knowledge, just the game didn't behave as expected)However the developer announced 1 year back that they would remake the game in the Unity game engine. (It's currently based in CefSharp, C# bindings for the Chromium project). Hopefully that announcement will still hold up, but for now just avoid this game."
18,2609,"Seems to be another logical simulation game/guide thing, but completely peppered with issues. I didn't go more than a minute or two before having another complaint/suggestion for the game. Considering it was released in 2016, and still has so many issues, I do not recommend getting this game since it seems very unlikely that it will ever be fixed and actually enjoyable to play.Here are some of the issues I have:1. when first opening the game, it tells you ""This game requires your full attention while playing. [...] Do you want to play now?"" of course I want to play now, that's why I opened the game...2. there are basically no settings in the game. It will always run fullscreen borderless, you cannot change the controls, and there are no simple options you can use to change this.3. when I opened the game, it asked if I wanted to open the web-browser version. It said it would remember my choice. I clicked no, but now I'm curious to see if it's less buggy in a web browser. Well I'm not sure how to make it un-remember my choice since there's no options menu... maybe I could reset all the saved data, but then I would lose my progress in the game... what a horrible solution.4. the intro tutorial is horrendously slow-going. First time opening the ""design mode"" it greeted me with a four page text introduction, and it reads like a book.5. seems like the mouse wheel just scrolls vertically, instead of zooming out. I cannot find a way to zoom in or out, or scroll horizontally for that matter, no matter which buttons or scroll wheel combination I use. Maybe the web browser version works better, but I'd rather just refund the game instead of testing this."
19,2584,Really enjoyed it at first.But then my saved solutions keep getting corrupted and there is one level for me which just goes to a black screen preventing any further progress in the game.
20,2575,"I'm shocked :OHardware engineering is a simulation tool for microprocessors with logical gates and wiring. If you are not familiar with electronics, this game will mean nothing to you. It is a must try game for junior computer engineersThis game is promising for especially computer engineers and i have started to play with hype, since i am a computer engineer. The game has a potential of being a very creative tool since it has enough material to come up with ideas and put to test. There is a sandbox mode too. This was all ok for 30 minutes. And then...The circuit i have developed was faulty and i tried to restart the simulation to test the circuit again. The game started behaving nonresponsive and i had to delete my circuit because i was unable to save it. And i tried to exit to the main menu. It did not work either. And i have inputted Alt + F4 (see what i did there). The game closed and decided to never open up again :DSo with sanity, i cannot recommend this game. It is not actually a game, it is great logical gates and processors tutorial tool with a sense of humor and lots of potential. But i have no idea if the game has more than that. I can not play it :D"
21,2568,"Why do i need to log into this ""game"" when it just takes me to a freaking website? Don't waste your time or money!"
22,2562,"This game has a lot of potential and I would love to see it succeed but it has too many problems, as well there is little hope that it will be updated ever again so good luck with the problems. As others have said it's a great idea with poor execution."
23,2554,"Great game, I like to play it, but I get a little technical troubles. Once upon a time the game switched from the windows application to the browser page, and I don't know how to get it back. When you have lost connection with the server you may lose your progress in solving the problem. And you can't move your viewport. If you build your scheme and come up against the corner or edge of the viewport then you need to redraw the scheme elsewhere because you can't move your scheme or move the viewport. It looks like the developer doesn't improve the game."
24,2550,"Kung tangkilikin mo ang automating redstone devices sa Minecraft, maaari mong matamasa ang challange ng paglikha ng bahagi ng lohika upang malutas ang mga problema sa tunay na mundo. Halimbawa, ang isa sa mga unang antas ay humihiling sa iyo na lumikha ng isang nuclear detonator. Mahusay na kasiyahan."
25,2548,"At the moment there are to many bugs in this game...Maybe later it would be better, but now it's not playable."
26,2536,"Going to preface this by saying even though I'm giving a Thumbs Down, I don't think it's terrible. I have a nuanced opinion that just slightly leans more towards the negative than the positive. I wish Steam Reviews could give a "" Mixed "" option as far as reviews go so with that said, I'll get on with it.First off, IF YOU HAVE NEVER DONE ANYTHING REMOTELY RELATED TO HARDWARE ENGINEERING AND WANT TO BUY THIS EARLY ACCESS, STOP. I really do want to like this game but I can't recommend it at its current state. Granted, this is Early Access, but still - this is more of feedback to devs than anything. Whenever this game exits Early Access and is updated into a more complete form, I'll gladly revisit this review.The developers describe this game with words like "" simple "" and "" easy "" but I don't necessarily agree with that description. Even when I was messing around with something like Car Mechanic Simulator (and I didn't know jack about cars before then) I got the hang of what to look for and memorized a majority of the components after about an hour or 2. With this, I'm 3 hours in and I'm stumped on the tutorial. Yes, there are explanations with each tutorial but I was still VERY lost. I ultimately had to turn away, go look up some fundamentals on YouTube, and then start over. In an attempt to dumb it down for everyone, it seems the developers have left out key information that would've made things a lot simpler to understand in the long run. I mean looking at it now, the logic gates just aren't very well explained at all. Maybe it's just me, but I found it much easier to understand wtf I'm looking at by learning the algebraic formulas for each and seeing the Truth Tables up front rather than reading the very miniscule descriptions offered for each in the tutorial. What's even dumber is that I'm usually TERRIBLE at understanding anything related to math. I'm a visual learner which is a huge reason why I got this.Despite what my name is, I'm not dumb. I can grasp the basic concepts of most things fairly quickly if I get a decent explanation. The fact I'm struggling this much means that the developers really oughta take another crack at this.Or maybe I really am just an idiot lolAt any rate, if there's anyone else struggling like I am, here are 2 resources I used that helped me understand Logic Gates better. http://electronics-course.com/logic-gateshttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDf2vEcyDfs"
27,2529,"If you are interested in learning how computers are built, this is a great learning tool that makes the process more enjoyable by presenting educational material in a series of fun puzzles. It's similar to a slightly less polished zachtronics game, except with a computational model used in the real world."
28,2526,A terrible interface mars an interesting concept.
29,2525,Game is really neat but even tough my computer can take care of it it is still slow. And there are sometimes logic errors in explaining. Truth tables are right tough. Overall 5/10.
30,2522,"Great Game!Thinking with logic gates, inputs, outputs, and much more!The Competitive mode adds a bit of spiceBut complete a level to relax, and enjoy hardware engineering!"
31,2514,"The game require to have a connection with their servers to actually run, and where I live, the ping is extremely high.it cause my game to take longer to update what I am doing on the board and ontop of loading the game by itself.The reason why you can play on your webbrowser or in steam is because steam is nothing but just a webloader.The game is very interesting, and it require you to ignore the tutorials and actually find help using google.but I can not recommand it because of the extremly bad optimization.running a 4ghz processor and a 1080 graphic card, the game still struggle like hell to place and remove wire, place items and so on.Looking at the game source, I can see why, its nothing but an extremely huge .js file where all the game code is writen.sadness, so much potential wasted."
32,2513,"SummaryThis could have been the best game of its kind, and perhaps still can be. It's obvious that it was released in a buggy state that frustrated a lot of people (even though it's an Early Access title), and it's still too buggy now, but as an engineering game/simulator it's unbeatable for me. There are a lot of different modules you can use - logic gates, signal adjusters, adders, subtractors, memory units and much more. You can create countless different things and the ""story mode"" allows a very interesting, natural progression. Even though it's quite flawed and I had to restart the game a few times, losing my progress because the simulation didn't work and it was impossible to save the game (the save menu failed to work) I will give it my recommendation anyway as I know it will provide my inner engineers many more hours of fun. I actually like it more than Shenzhen I/O as it offers you more possibilities, especially with the game's sandbox mode. What works1. A great selection of parts that allow you to build countless different things.2. The style - I really like it. It's very clean, customizable, and clear. 3. The progression in design mode can be challenging and perhaps could have been explained better at times, but overall is quite well thought through. 4. There are quite a lot of ""missions"" to try and each can take quite a long time to get just right to provide a lot of fun. 5. The sandbox, level editor and component editor offer amazing possibilities and an endless source of fun.6. The price/fun ratio is simply amazing here.What doesn't work1. Bugs. The most annoying one is when you can't save game sometimes and the simulation doesn't work - the bar moves forward but then immediately moves backwards to reach zero again. 2. No Steam Workshop - it would be great to share puzzles on Steam and download new ones."
33,2511,"It's difficult to recommend this game because the learning curve is a wall, the description and hints are not always helpful and some basics, e.g. circuit algebra, you have to teach yourself.If you will spend time (possibly many time for a single task), or if you already have some knowledge, then you should take a look. It has a better GUI and also contains programmable elements in contrast to free circuit simulators like ""Logisim Evo"" oder ""Digital"".A hint for newbies (from a newbie) for a game session: Take one or two hours, a cup of tea (or something else) and write your own notes on paper.Farther:- the save function doesn't work correct .. after loading the elements are displaced- no performance issues on a 7 years old notebook- controls are OK ... maybe an ""Undo"" as well as a ""select-and-delete"" function would be nice (I did not have the problems named in the other reviews)- good representation of the circuit states during the simulation- many many possibilities in sandbox mode (create and test)"
34,2509,"Concept is good.Line editing is very horrible and anoying, can't delete wire easily, very fustrating.Running in browser is slow and smothly. Stream client is stucking on running state after quit from browser."
35,2505,"I regret buying this game.I am now deaf.Litterally unplayable.Not even worth the effort of uninstalling.Story:I was interested in practincing some digital ciruit building and get more familiar with the logic and components involved.  The information available is helpful, and understandable (although english/grammer is poor at times); however, the application comes with a warning *after* install that it may not run well the first time for cache building.  It actually ran fine the first few times I played, but that's where the pleasantries, and my restraint not to write a scathing review ended.When I started the game today, it gave me the same warning as before, blah, blah, blah... typical.  What I didn't expect was for the wizards behind the game to cast a level 5 spell of tidal-square-wave of deafness on me.  My eardrums, after getting blown strait out through my anus, astonishingly became sentient!  They jumped off my head, and began stabing me repeatedly in the holes and raw flesh where the ears had just been firmly and comfortably attached.  They were kind enough not to douche the bloody holes with salt.When the assault stopped, along with my headset against the wall, I diverted my attention away from my aching ears by removing my index fingers with a nearby pair of pliers.  I closed the game, disconnected my headphones, and attempted to load it again.  Thanks to the marvel that is the potentiometer, I successfully rolled my speaker volume to a respectable level of ""off"".  After cracking them into the lowest possible ""on"" setting I relaunched the game to see if something other than my eardrums would explode.  I didn't hear anything.... BECAUSE I WAS NOW DEAF!  The buzzing noise, now at my command by the marvelous dial, was still present.  I attempted this several more times, including a restart, but had no success.Since my desire to hurl a bag of kittens off a bridge had not been quenched yet, my last attempt to remain sane was to type up a delightful review to express my gratitude from never hearing another Nickleback song.5 out of 5.Would go deaf again."
36,2504,"Miss too much features, like move multiple elements. Copy and paste elements.I had better in 2003 with free software..."
37,2504,"Bugged, the gates does not work, had two true input on an AND gate, it outputed 0, did the same for other gates, this simply does not work at all.Unplayable.Also very poor design on controls, can't cancel things (or just delete all), you can't place things wherever you want (you have to follow the grid), the mouse lags, when you move a gate that is already wired, the wires disconnect and you will have to reconnect them.I am a developper myself, and I think this is unaceptable, even for an early access.I asked for a refund.For eventual buyers : just don't buy it."
38,2504,"The game shows flaws and bugs to such extent that it is de facto unplayable. The developers are slow and/or reluctant to either fix problems or release the game as open source, so that other people might take care of them.To send a clear message to the developers, I suggest you don't buy this game yet."
39,2504,"a good game, but need a french translation, soms teacher can use this game to teach to students"
40,2495,Best game I have seen for Digital Logic gates and much more. Addictive
41,2487,"As an engineering student I enjoy this game. As it is Early Access, there are still s few bugs to be found - none of them game breaking as far as I am concerned; I guess some forget that this is still early access, so such things are to be expected. The Devs are really responsive to problems and requests and have so far always been able to help me out. If you wanna learn about digital electronics, this is a (not so easy although still) a good start."
42,2486,"As of right now I would not recommend this game to anyone that doesn't already understand the intricacies or electrical components already. The tutorials are written in a manner that only someone with prior knowledge would understand it and if you have prior knowledge then the tutorials would be pointless. Also, I didn't buy this game to read a hardware engineering book. So much text! I would like a walk through. Explain what I'm doing as I do it and don't make me read a book to figure it out. If you already know what you are doing, it looks like an amazing playground where you can just create all sorts of fun hardware."
43,2485,If you love to stare at blank screens for an hour wondering when the game will load you will love this game. Aside from a rediculous first time loading time it is an all around fun game. Very chalenging and rewarding when you finally figure it out. If you dont mind the long time first load it's well worth the play. If you're having continued trouble loading try launching in your browser.
44,2484,Very good for starting engineers!
45,2475,Doesnt run in browser or on steam. Epic fail.
46,2471,"Very interesting game about building circuits. You can learn a lot. It's an early access, so be aware it might has some bugs."
47,2468,"The least responsive testing times i've ever seen, speed up the servers..."
48,2467,"I have always wanted to say one thing about this game that was bugging me for a decent amount of time now. This game is sepose to teach you electronics and programming and stuff but it doesn't really doing it. All it doesse is just throws you in to a puzzle with nearly 0 explanation(not in every level) and then you have a long frustrating crash course. I stopped playing this game the second i got to programming. The game gives you a long(ish) manual and expects you to find the information you need in a pile of other currently useless information. You cant learn programming this way. This is not user friendly way of teaching. The game should at least give you an example programm so that you can understand the structure and syntax.Can you please add the actual tutorial in the game? I know how programming works, I am familiar with assembly, Realy like to write in Java, and used to make Flash games, but the manual wasn't enough for me to understand what this game wants from me"
49,2461,Since the update it is even playable without browser! Very good. Thanks a milllion.Very good game
50,2461,"After some 8+ hours in this game, time for some feedback and comments.First, a big controversy. I can confirm THIS GAME IS FULLY PLAYABLE, in its current state of development.There is a blocking issue at the very first tutorial, stopping further access into the game. Neglected by devs for a while, leading to users complaints about game unplayable... BUT Hopefully, an easy turnaround exists - sending an ingame bug report - that unlocks the game progression. Now about gameplay. This puzzle-educational game holds its originality in the way it teaches a pretty tough subject in a non-usual academic manner. Decades ago... I studied hardware engineering. I've been attracted by the fun challenge here, and the souvenirs of the past, as I never applied this knowledge during my career. The progression in levels is captivating, through incremental pedagogic steps, and it introduces gradually more and more complex concepts. Tutorials have yourself create and experiment applied designs, while the on-board simulator brings an in depth understanding of the logics going into the wires and chipsOf course, there's still work to be done by the devs - user interface is a bit rustic at the moment - but this Alpha stage game (devs status) is already pleasant to use, so hopefully, it should get even better in the futureThe in-game bug report is also a good idea for feedback.Eventually, I can say I'm getting good time and fun with this puzzle-educational game, and that's IMHO the most important.Really worth a try if you like this kind of games"
51,2461,"Completely disappointed by this game. It is not playble!To complete a level you need to perform its circuit simulation but this functionalitydoesn't work and you get stucked on the very first level.No kind of message about win or fail appears and this game remains suspendedwithout giving you any sign of life.Totally unplayable, please fix it!UPDATE:problem fixed now the game works greatrly. Simple mechanics but with challenging level, it is funny and exciting foryour mind, it also not so expensive so buy it now! Totally recommended."
52,2461,"Game is in a meh state, buggy, and has weak support from devs. I was never able to get any circuit to complete its simulation, others acknowledge these types of problems, but devs seem to just dismiss them. Game is server-side only, yet devs report frequent issues with connectivity making it nonfunctional (of course, devs blame it on users. It is NOT on my end however).While I would normally put up with these in an early access game, the devs inability to accept that issues exist and their general arrogance leads me to believe this game will not be going anywhere good. That's a shame, it's a type of game I'd like to see more of...Refund Requested.Maybe if the issues are resolved I'll consider it again.Based on devs attitudes, I'm not holding my breath though."
53,2460,"This is more a learning experience than a game. If you're into circuit engineering, you're probably going to find something to learn and challenges to complete.The reason I cannot recommend this title is because the developer is failing to provide working online servers while simultaneously being cocky about this game requiring online connectivity on the forums, using language like (paraphrasing) ""I'd like to remind you that unlike you I've seen the code for this game"" to another user asking for help.Since there's no logical reason for this game to require online connectivity, this is a huge no for me. This would be the perfect game to take on a train or plane where a few hours can be wasted away, but nope.EDIT: Since this isn't apparently obvious to everyone, the negative portion of the review has to do with the online requirement and nothing to do with the developer's arrogant attitude. It's a good game when it works."
54,2460,i have alll if not higher minum speck needed to play this but it wolnt run. :steamsad::steamsad::steamsad::steamsad::steamsad::steamsad::steamsad::steamsad::steamsad:
55,2459,"A great concept, if you have an interest in programming itself (like me)--or want to gain an appreciation for programming and technical problem solving. This game has Real-World learning potential!Unfortunately, the delivery stands in the way of the concept.I had hoped for more progress from the devs regarding the game nuts-and-bolts, so I grieve that I must down vote at this time. Zachtronics' ShenZen I/O is NOT an entirely suitable substitute, but if you feel immediately compeled to try the flavor, check that out first."
56,2458,"Not badNot bad at allLike redstone on minecraftbut way more infuriatingLove it thoughI only recommend it for those of you who are into building circuits, otherwise you'll be bored to tears :p"
57,2458,Some of levels have a lot of bugs. If u like to hurt yourself buy it.
58,2457,"Right off the bat: The game is lacking a lot of polish, menus are slow and oftentimes frustrating, I've encountered bugs where changes I make to assembly code don't stick (I always end up having to test twice before my changes go through, but occasionally that's not enough), the instructions aren't always clear and everything is online, so if their servers go down you can't play at all.If any of that is a dealbreaker (which would be totally fair), this game isn't for you.If you can look past that stuff, it's a lot of fun to work with circuits and microprocessors at a lower level than most programming games let you. All the stuff I listed above are annoyances but the game is still enough fun for me that I'd recommend it anyway."
59,2455,"In this game's current state, you constantly have to wrestle control from the game in order to do anything. There must be some sort of large memory leak somewhere to cause this, but at the moment the game is frustratingly unplayable."
60,2448,"Please don't buy this game unless one day, they decided to let you download the full game or whatever this is,  play offline and not this kind of obligatory logging to their computers/servers, a portion of a full game. Game is unplayable   at the mercy of their servers, developers doesn't help too, please don't heed this warning"
61,2447,"Hardware Engineering is overall a fun game, but sometimes it just blows my mind. The circuitry sometimes is just too hard for me to process.Pros:-Puzzles to keep you playing for some time.-Sandbox mode to allow you build any kind of circuit you want.Cons:-A game that cannot be played in one session (Simply too much to be handled)"
62,2444,"At the moment, this game is not fun at all.*Placing the wires is tedious*When running the testing simulation, it is frustrating to have to click through all the cases*The autmatic curving of the wires makes quite a mess*The animation for switching tabs in the toolbox is slow*the labeling of the input/output is not clear at allsuggestions:*all the nessesary inputs/outputs should be pre-placed and clearly labeled*add a button to run thruogh all the test cases in one go*improve the automatic wire routing or make the grid bigger*increase the size of the toolbox window and make only the parts needed for the current task visible"
63,2442,The game is recomended for the people who are interested in the topic.
64,2442,"That feeling you get when you create your first full adder and suddenly realize what has been hand-waved and glossed over when they first taught you arithmatic in kendergarten: There is a logic more fundamental than 1 + 1.Full disclosure: I'm a computer programmer. I can write in assembly. I shift bits for work every day. I simplify randomly generated quadratic equations to pass the time like others might solve a crossword puzzle. Finding and following simple logic steps is enjoyable for me. And this game is all about that.This is currently one of my favorite games. I think if you're the type who likes to play with redstone in minecraft, or likes to create elaborate traps in dwarf fortress, this game is for you. If you're like me and like to play with electronics on a breadboard for fun, but don't always have time or space to work on a learning project, then this game is for you.Levels are simple enough to knock one out at work while I'm on break, so far.I've had no problems with the interface and the program has run well for me.I can see myself putting a lot more time into this."
65,2441,"This is a great idea, just needs refinement (basically a complete rewrite of the copy, and some minor GUI tweaks).This is best run from Chrome. Don't start it from Steam, use the web site. That way you can research the concepts, which is necessary if you want any hope of enjoying the process. It's ridiculous that the author suggests you go through this game based solely on the sparse instructions given; especially because there are many many awesome articles and youtube videos by excellent teachers explaining the exact concepts you are learning in this app. You will learn a lot if you research the problems yourself. Why the author insists in trying to box you into the app is beyond me.The author is going to annoy you with stupidity like this excerpt: ""We could surely build a new truth table and try to face the problem of subtraction by elementary means, but we leave that as an exercise to you and as a catastrophe for your sandbox. Equipped with the wisdom of elderly, we can cease the fact that A - B = A + (-B) for our own good."" There is only a very small amount of actual useful information there, left almost passive-aggressively unexplained to the reader. If an actual person spoke like that to me, I'd want to give him a wedgie.You'll also have to find settings and disable the clunky retro minimal techno soundtrack because its about as irritating as the writing.All that said, there is one redeeming quality to this app. You will learn something, which is the whole point."
66,2441,I can see what this program (it's certainly not a game) is trying to achieve but you require a relatively advanced understanding of electronics to get anywhere.  There is a tutorial but no indication of whether what you're doing is right or not and no guidance to speak of.  No stars from me.
67,2441,you could learn something
68,2440,"It's a nice game, you only have to get used to the not so much responsive but beautiful interface"
69,2440,"Firstly i have to say the premise of this game is excellent, as a budding 40 yrs in Basic electronics (just building simple circuits with a breadboard and components, then moved onto pcs circuits using SOLDER...not SODA as the Americans pronounce it...SPEAK ENGLISH), still using the breadboard initially , as converting to a pcb you have to design is fraught with errors etc).However , after the first introduction course (project 1) i found from then on it seems there are a few chapters missing, going from a simple AND circuit to an impossible task for me on the 2ns project.I really hope that more detail on the components on how they work, espescially IC circuits is put into an easier format.For instance , teaching Flow charts, kernaugh mapping and so on.I feel this would help people who have very little knowledge, or none whatsoever to enjoy this subject.I consider myself a novice still and stuck on the 2nd project.Please consider more easier projects, instead of jumping in the deep end on the 2nd (introductory) project of which it has baffled me already.I do reccomend this program as it is and would be an excellent tool, to help understand the fundamentals of Logic electronics....But please more simple projects to ease into."
70,2440,"Not ready yet. Still somewhat wonky. Also, as of this moment, no longer available offline. Something I consider an insult to all buyers. I know it's ""Early Access"", but going from client-based to browser-based, that is WAAAAAYYYYY too big a change to just use the ""Early Access"" excuse. I advice potential buyers to wait until full release, it appears the devs aren't themselves sure where they are headed with this game."
71,2440,"Overall pretty good, but the controls are a bit wonky and sometimes don't work"
72,2439,great consept and a great game. it suffers from some bugs but overall its a fun educational game for those who want learn about logic gates. lastly for such a low price its definetly worth it.
73,2439,Great concept and execution. Well worth the price. Worth while. With a patch this wll be prime.
74,2439,"Honestly, this game has a lot of potential. But for the tutorial to not run properly/at all is my only legitimate reason for you not to get this game."
75,2439,Always online requirement makes it practically impossible to play with the quality of my current internet connection. Might reconsider if and when the game is playable offline.
76,2439,"Sadly i need to change my review.There seem to be no progress for months.Does not look like this game will ever leave early access.Great new idea of a ""puzzle"" game.Here are my pro's:* the developer is active in the forum* beside the normal logic-components there are even more complex components inside* contains tutorial texts that explains everything* you can learn something useful by this game (you don't see much games like this sadly)And here are some negatives:* bad thing is of course that you need to be online because you play it inside an embedded browser.  that means the game won't work anymore once the server is gone (because it gets too expensive for them,etc. ).  Sadly this is mentioned nowhere and i hope that this game gets enough support to survive a long time.* going to next Test-step has a delay ... it is damn annyoing to click again and again just to go through all the needed steps (an auto-next step till first error would be great even if the delay would not be removable because of server requests)* i somehow dislike the backgroundmusic sometimes* currently no workshop integration (i would like to share created levels/components, etc.)I decided to give it a positive review because i believe that this game has potential."
77,2439,"I love Hardware Engineering!This is a very challenging game and not for the average person looking to kill time, that is why I enjoy it a lot. If you know nothing about circuits, binary or logic gates, bytes, etc.  you will have to dedicate time towards learning about the individual components.  Once learned, everything becomes easier. I have played about 4 hours of Hardware Engineering and I will play for many more hours because of the mechanics which make up the core of the game. I used to play other games for mechanics with circuitry (Logic gates, IC, etc.), but now I will play Hardware Engineering.  This game is still in Early Access so I am hoping that it keeps evolving and becomes more advanced. ProsExcellent gameplay mechanics.Lots of different logic gates and IC (Integrated Circuits) Able to code microprocessors!Can have real life applications.Interesting and challenging scenarios.Learning through problem solving.ConsThere are still a few glitches that I have noticed, such as wires being active when they should not be.Only online play (But I understand their point for running the game off their servers.)I have been looking for a game that has circuits which can be made through the use of IC and logic gates and programming. Hardware Engineering has delivered.Keep up the good work Developers!"
78,2439,Excellent learning game. It's working fine for me with none of the performance issues that were mentioned in some of the other reviews. I'm only a few levels in but loving it so far!
79,2439,love it great for school.
80,2439,"Great game for learning about digital circuits.. The interface can be a little fiddly at times, and the content is pretty heavy.. this is definitely a game about learning, not a casual puzzle game.The devs are crazy active.. report a bug on the forum and it's often fixed minutes later.. because the game runs on servers it doesnt even require a client update to get fixes.It WILL require an always active internet connection though, so, keep that in mind if thats not your thing.If you take the time to learn what this game is teaching you, you're in for a HUGELY satisfying experience.. but it may require a bit of study.. like I said, it's not a casual puzzle game.If you have even a passing interest in electronics, computer hardware, programming, logic, boolean algebra, or anything along those lines, you'll probably really enjoy this one."
81,2439,"Felt needed to subtract from the overwhelming number of simple minded people here.Maybe not so much of a game as an incredible learning tool.  I feel like i have learned more in an hour then I ever did playing around with breadboards.Does it need some work?   yea thats why its early access...Am I happy to support early access games?  Honeslty not really, been there done that and seen it fail.Why did I buy it anyway?  After reading some well written reviews from clearly knowledgable persons I knew it was something I wanted to play and support getting better.  If you want to learn about hardware logic which is not ""easy"" or maybe even ""fun"" for some people then this is something for you.  If you are in for the lulz and herppin and derpin, just leave now."
82,2439,"For me, the game is in a playable state with no noticable bugs as of October 1st, 2016.This game will absolutely challenge you but if you stay persistent you will find yourself actually learning by simply playing a game. This is like one giant interactive circuit schematic designer which is an incredible tool to use. I really don't find the controls unintuitive like others and enjoy the simplicity.Hit W to swap between drag/dropping things and placing wires, G to pull up the grid so you can let your OCD take over, which trust me, you'll want that .It starts off incredibly simple and becomes more complex over time with each level requiring you to expand on the knowledge you've gained from the previous levels. This is a wonderful approach because it makes sure that your new found skills actually stick with you and you don't forget them. Sometimes there are grammatical errors but those can for the most part be easily ignored. I still don't understand some things when explained in words because of all the technical terms for concepts but that's okay, because getting the hands on experience, seeing what's going on with the logic gates and building the circuits then running the test should give you a far better idea of what's going on. Plus those truth tables are a godsend. Sure it only has digital logic but that's not necessarily a bad thing, especially if you have no experience with this kind of thing as it will probably seem overwhelming enough as is. You can do a lot with digital logic anyways.This had a really buggy release a couple days ago and could even still be buggy for some people today but fortunately it seems stable on my end. The developer responded to me immediately as well as many others with assurance that they're fixing the game up as fast as they can and so far has delivered a patch and several hotfixes that have fixed all of my problems. They were also curteous, which is always nice.I'd recommend this game to: Engineers, anyone interested in how computers work, anyone who really really likes puzzles, and pretty much any fan of Zachtronics games. It might not have all the polish in the world but seeing as it now works properly for me and I can actually play the game, it is an incredibly wonderful, fun, and most of all SATISFYING (when you finally succeed) experience that I can safely say is worth the ~$5 I spent on it. I hope this game gets both the attention, and optimization (bug fixes for everyone) that it deserves/needs."
83,2439,"I like the idea of the game however it is very broken at the moment. I can't even play it as when I load the game it say ""cannot connect to the HWE servers"" then the game closes. I have the required specifications and a stable internet connection so until the game gets fixed I'm going to have to give this game a thumbs down."
84,2439,"Much like other reviewers, I love this concept. I'm an engineering student, and it's entertaining / challenging to go over topics that I have covered in class. This is a great tool to learn logic design.However, the interface needs a lot of work. Deleting things takes a long time, and I've had a few tests get stuck in an infinite loop in which I had to stop the test and start over.I'm also not a huge fan of the testing protocol. Our computers are good enough to simulate every case in 10-20 cycles (Most people's computers run at let's say 3+ GHz, so literally microseconds.) yet it takes full seconds to delete wires and run tests. Not only that, but it's unclear what end case it's supposed to be. It tells you which output is wrong, but you have to go back and figure out what that output's going to be.And don't get me started on their backward truth tables that follow no rhyme or reason! Usually a truth table goes from 0 0 0 0 to 1 1 1 1, not jumps around with no logic.I am hopeful the developers will continue to tweak the interface and improve the game. As of now, I have to say it's definitely a mixed bag of nuts that requires a lot of patience.I do not recommend it in it's current state, however it has a huge potential for improvement."
85,2439,"Game freezes as soon as it is started. Two dialogs pop up saying they the game requires concentration then that the game's first start up takes a while to build a cache. Game sat for 40 minutes on a black screen.After several restarts I got to the main menu once ( and never again since) but once I clicked an option the game crashed again back to the black screen never to recover or do anything. Every attempt to start this game since has been met with an endless black screen. The solution to this problem on the discussion page (download WMW and make sure you're connected to the internet) does not work.Upon inspecting the debug.log it is just outputting some combination of the following errors endlessly:[0928/183425:ERROR:renderer_main.cc(200)] Running without renderer sandbox[0930/004358:WARNING:raw_channel_win.cc(473)] WriteFile: The pipe is being closed.

86,2439,"An engaging idea for a game that is spoilt by poor execution. The tutorials are not well written, the workspace is unresponsive and the presentation can be confusing. I will leave in my LIbrary until it's been patched."
87,2439,"Worth it for the price. Its clunky and awkward, but you get what you pay for. For me, the odd English adds to the charm. The more you play, the more adapted you'll be to its quirks and issues and you just work around them. If it was much more expensive I'd say no, but its a steal at current price < USD5."
88,2439,"First off for anyone experiencing this issue, pressing W activates place wire mode not MMB.Right clicking the wire in this mode deletes wires; this system is clunky since it takes a few clicks most of the time, i assume to not registaring.I keep having to restart levels due to the simulation not working at some point (I'm in the tutorial), when this happends you cannot save so save regulary.Game is good if you want to learn stuff, very challenging but use Archem's Razor theory, simply is usually correct.If issues are fixed buy the game, im going to soldier on with the bugs."
89,2439,"Ok - I have only just used it, can't really define it as a game, but I've bought it to brush up on my electronics - it's either this or a book, so I'm going to say this is wonderful, as a book on electronics is coma inducing.Well worth the small price.This is going to be the only game that I'm going to have to force myself to play. I'm also going to recommend this to other people within my work as this will be an essential learning tool.Note to devs:1) Advertise this somewhere electronic orientated - it will sell like hot cakes because it is way less boring than a book.2) Who the hell is that into electronics that you write a ""game"" for it? If you do somehow manage to get a girlfriend (only because you made so much money from this) promise me you won't breed :p3) WHY OH WHY DOES IT HAVE TO BE ONLINE? Come on, don't do this to us . . . ."
90,2439,"When I buy a game I expect to be able to access it at any point in time. I bought this game yesterday, and have not had time to actually get on it until today. Now I try to play and I am told it is down for maintinance. If I buy and download a single player game I should always be able to access it. Furthermore the game does not provide any way for you to exit the screen that tells you that you can't play it. You have to use the task manager or alt+tab to exit. So I cannot recomend this game as there is no garuntee that by buying it you will actually get to play it. I feel like I have been cheated. Don't buy this game, save your money and buy a textbook instead, At least paper won't need to update when you want to learn."
91,2439,"I have played 80mins fo this games and was originally quite excited about learning something fairly new.  I say ""fairly"" as I would say I have a basic understanding of circuits and logic and programming.I started with the tutorial which really need more explanation to play.  Unless, I missed it, there was no indication that to draw a wire, you press ""w"".  Anyway, once I figured that out, the first couple of tasks seemed ok and then, bam!  The learning curve went vertical and completely bamboozled me with stuff I didn't understand.  It was like a completely different language but written in a way that seemed like I should be understanding it fine as these were still the basics.  Would not recommend unless you want to do some googling along side to make sense of some of it!"
92,2439,"As a professional software engineer with a more-than-lingering interest in small electronics, this so far has served as an excellent intro / learning tool for circuits. Compared to a few other offerings out there on itch and iOS, this is definitely a more thorough learning tool.While the UI has its quirks, my main complaint is the lack of instruction on how to create wires, in addition to the 'online online' aspect of this game. If they're able to make the entire thing accessible offline, I'll be much more pleased."
93,2439,"Okay so I've sunk a few hours into this game so here's the rundown (so far):Negatives-The language and explanations can sometimes be quite hard to understand and it can be frustrating in a game this technical but it's not atrocious and if you persevere you'll do fine.-The controls can be quite frustrating as well. I see a lot of people are complaining about having to use the middle mouse button for wires but if you press W you toggle the wire tool so that's not an issue. The biggest issue I have is that when you move a component the wires don't move with it, you have to re-arrange them manually.Positives-This game is truly one of a kind. It's very rare to find a game that is both equally educational and satisfying to this extent.-It provides not only tutorials but design (puzzle) and sandbox levels which would allow you create your own components, processors etc and then compile them into modules which you can reuse on larger scales. It's extensible.Rounding OffThe developers are already ironing out any issues and improving on the controls. The game itself does have a steep learning curve but there's no better feeling than understanding and overcoming it.If you enjoy topics relating to logic gates and electronic engineering and have some basic understanding on how binary operates (this is coming from a programmer) then I urge you to try this game out."
94,2439,"Edit 10/2/16:Most of the original issues I've had have been fixed, going back to enjoying the game. Developers are pretty quick to respond! High hopes for this game.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Game can be very good for the right type of person, but it is quite a buggy mess at this point.What's broken:1) Deleting wires is messy right now, each wire section must be clicked on separately to delete, also deleting is rather... laggy.2) Full 1-bit adders do not work. For some reason the carry-out does not actually signal anything. Don't believe me? 4th screenshot shows a black wire on the carry-out line for the full adder, when running a circuit simulation a black wire is one that is not carrying any signal. This does make getting a good rank on one of the levels impossible.3) When in wire laying mode, selecting a new component to place will change your cursor, but the behavior is a bit... strange... you have to click drag to place the part, and then place a wire at the same time, and there's no indication it's because you're in wiring mode, so you'll click around for a bit wondering what the heck is going on.4) Typos... but meh, not game breaking.Quality of life issues:1) Honestly only one that I've encountered so far, and that's the wires do not follow the component around, so moving a component means deleting and redoing the wires. Combined with the really buggy and laggy wire deletion scheme means sometimes you'll start a level over just to avoid having to delete wires.The good:1) Learn about circuits!2) Challenging, for someone who's not an electrical engineer, this actually teaches the basics pretty well. Learn by doing is great.3) Presents components in bite sized chunks, never really throws too much at you, but a bit more explanation could help.Overall, this game is not in a very user friendly state. I still find it fun, but I'm one of those people who don't mind some hassle if it means I learn something interesting. I do hope the developer gets around to fixing the bugs, as this has a lot of potential to be a great sandbox game."
95,2439,Less of a game and more of a 101 in Electronic Engineering.Drawing the wires is a bit frickly but doable.Fun if you like puzzles with  a lifelike background.
96,2439,"Well I was pretty excited about getting this game, I thought the negative reviews were just  expcting too much....But unless expecting a functional game is too much, this game is . Most of the levels are bugged, like level 6 where for some reason my OR gate (if at least one input is 1, gate outputs 1) outputs 0 no matter what, making the level  UNBEARABLE!! Fix the game and maybe I'll wright a better review. I want either a refund or MANY update, very quickly.**********UPDATE**********Level has been patched and works fine now, I'd still say do not buy unless you want to be apart of an early development process."

98,2439,"only played the first few tutorials, a bit clunky,  but very enjoyable. what a great way to learn circuit logic!Had a problem with deleting wiring.overall, well worth the reasonable price"
99,2439,"Brilliant idea and very well executed. This game is not only educative, but also a lot of fun and it certainly gives you a sense of achievement when completing the levels. Personally I believe there could be more levels, the details could be more exhaustive, there could be a tutorial for complete beginners and some of the design could use a little more work. Overall, great game and I would definitely recommend this. No performance issues whatsoever here at all."

Too much language in the initial instance and poorly written.2. Interface is clunky.  Click to select, click to drop, MMB for selecting wire points which don't snap properly.  Then moving parts around the board don't keep the wires attached.  There is huge room for improvement here - though it is a good start as it does looks nice.3. Design language.  Perhaps there's a reason I'm missing but why not use the same image for a NOR chip in the inventory as on the board?4. Game.  Ok, this feels much more like an exam than a puzzle game (though I appreciate this in a way).  However, it is a sudden and sharp learning curve for anyone who is new to the subject.  Consider making the tutorial a series of levels instead of a tutorial with far more problems to solve in a far longer learning curve.I like this game, but you do need time and plenty of it - no criticism there.

'Levels' and 'Sandbox' are the only buttons that work and they take you to a log-in page which itself is glitched. It is in a loop constantly asking you to sign in. I would HIGHLY recommend NOT getting this game. Every aspect as far as I can see is glitched and bugged. Developers, when you read this, you must fix this. It is absolutly crap."
114,2439,"An enjoyable game at a reasonable price.My only complaint is that the interface is a bit sluggish. But since today is the game's launch, I imagine it'll be fixed.Definitely worth purchasing."
115,2439,"It will be a good game, after they solve the deleting wires problem. They will solve it, right..?"
116,2439,"I rarely review, but I don't think this game deserves to get dogpiled by negative reviewsWhen the game starts it plainly states not to play this for too long in one sitting and that you need to really concentrate on it, its good advice. I woke up early to play it before class for a while and I already feel pretty mentally drained before heading out the door. That being said, I had fun and I will continue to play it for fun and education, as I think this is potentially a valuable learning resource.In regards to the allegations by other users about the text being distracting or confusing, I can't agree with them. It's written better than most textbooks I've had to deal with on similar subject matters, and I appreciate the snippets of personality that were injected throughout.There are a few bugs, and its a bit tiring changing around the circuits, but overall I can tell that this has already been pretty polished. I look forward to playing this further and I hope the community eventually comes about to share my sentiments."
117,2439,"Great idea, but it has problems of execution. In particular, the GUI and the mouse control are very poor. My mouse keeps slipping when I try to connect elements with a wire. Also, the text needs a lot more clarity and more helpful exposition. Moreover, some options seem to have been unimplemented. My general impression is that this game is far from finished. A pity, because it has potential for a truly solid piece of educational gaming. I haven't returned this because I am hoping that these issues will be sorted out with future patches. And I hope that this is sooner rather than later. However, for now, I cannot recommend what is virtually an unfinished product."
118,2439,"Im surprised it this wasn't released as an early access game. So far Im having alot of technical issue including the main menu not loading when starting up, none of the main menu buttons working, and when they do work it only takes you to a black screen where nothing happens. I have no idea what the actually game play is like since I cant get it to work. I wish you luck on getting this fix Dev. Look foward to actually playing. Just a rough start I'd say.But for now I wouldnt quite recommend it unless you want to risk finding out if itll work for you and actively help out on fixing it!Edit: Now that apparently the game ran in the background for more than two hours, I cannot refund it. I REALLY hope the game gets fixed soon."
119,2439,"tbh, this game is awesome for those who like electrical engineering course.. Dear developer, i hope u read my review n fix it..- for me, playing through steam client is more experienced than web browser, so i had some lagg issues when i want to delete components, it tooks several seconds like 5-10 secs ..- sometimes, the game is running but it dont display on the screen (all black)... so yeah, we all know this game is new and need to be improved by time and ofcourse there are some flaws that cant be avoid.... i hope developer fix it by the next month.. for now i give the thumbs up..if u dont..i will give thumbs down.."
120,2439,"Overall a very challenging game, if you are a real EE then it will be easy. Unfortuatly it does have quite a few bugs but i still recommend it if you are looking for a challenge."
121,2439,"If you were an electronics enthusiast in the 70's or 80's and loved using breadboards, components, small bits of wire, and ttl/cmos logic, then this is the game for you.  If you own the TTL or CMOS cookbook you already have the schematics.  This would have been your perfect learning tool at the time.If you are expecting unicorns and wizards then this is NOT for you.If you are older than the first mobile phones you will know that moving a component on a breadboard doesn't move the wires.  This is NOT VISIO and nor should it be.  This is as close as it gets to creating REAL working circuits on a breadboard (without the actual breadboard or power supply).I am extremely impressed but I'm a 70's electronics nerd so you can expect me to be biased.This is NOT for everyone and it's not a ""gamers"" game and for those who get stuck, when you run the circuit, examine the logic in the step you are up to.  It is not really that hard to figure out from the truth tables.It would be nice to be able to ""splice"" wires anywhere and at the moment the wire crossovers can get a bit confusing.One important thing to note, you can create an actual circuit instead of using the predifined components and it will still rate you as successful.  A fantastic learning tool.  (See my full adder example in the artwork area).I just wish they would speed up the delete.  It is a REAL problem.BTW to change wires click 'w' then use the left mouse button.  It took me ages to find that out today after they changed it overnight."
122,2439,Good game for this price. Even better after a few Patches.
123,2439,"Yes the interface is a little frustrating, and there's bugs, but its nothing some more spit and polish won't fix, and the price is a steal.If you're genuinely interested in learning something those things won't matter. This isn't so much a game as it is a valuable learning tool, and one that I sincerely hope the developers do not get discouraged by the initial negative reviews.I would recommend this to anybody interested in digital logic, the mere fact that it takes you from combinatorial logic to CPU instructions alone is astounding. There really isn't much else out there of this calibur aside from the simulation tools used in schools. All that's left outside of that are extremely dry textbooks.Please support these developers, they deserve it. We need more stuff like this. Desperately."
124,2439,Nice game to learn or improve your engineering skills!!!!
125,2439,"Cool design, shonky controls.  Good to see people taking an interest in the Zachtronics genre tho."
126,2439,"Developer E-Mailed me and replied to my Steam Review (below)...Wires are now easy to connect and this certainly ticks a few more boxes for me at least. Still a few problems connecting to the server but this IS a really GOOD game if you like Logic Circuits....Clunky interface...needs a LOT of improvements to make it work. Can't connect wires properly, components fly widly off the centre of the ""work area""...honestly I was really looking forward to this game and am faced with another dissapointment!"
127,2439,"Devs,You are this close to finish the game. why you left some stupid mistakes and bugs to ruin the reputation of the game?looking forward to fix this---------------------------------------after trying the fix it is so far playable without any major issues. Thank you devs for responding quickly.it is educational game please try it out."
128,2439,Loved the idea...but ended up getting JSON errors so the game got stuck m(
129,2439,"After initally leaving a bad review to this game I was contacted by one of the developers. The issue regaring the contorls has been resolved. It's a fun game, but the wiring is a little difficult to not cross wire components. Hopefully with a little more work this will be a great game."
130,2439,"So, apart from the ""delete wire"" lag part (even on a i7 4Ghz, GTX1080) - i cant draw lines.. it just scrolls around... is there a trick for this?Would be nice with custom keybindings.. dont really like to push the mouse-wheel. Also moving a gate, it would be nice if the wires stuck.."
131,2439,"So, past the first very weird warnings that pop up when you launch the game (Including the game telling you that you shouldn't play for long sessions, and, oddly enough, saying that the game is unoptimized and may run better for you in chrome), you come to a main menu. With no options menu. No idea what happens if you have a non-16:9 aspect ratio since it appears you can't change that or the resolution. There's a button that says 'basic' that does nothing when clicked, and other than that, I only clicked the tutorial button.When I opened the tutorial, a small box with a few messages from what I think is another 'engineer' in the game popped up. I couldn't scroll down the menu to read them all. There might not've been more, but the final message was cut off at the bottom, so that's a problem.So, the tutorial itself. Your goal is to do a 'logical multiplication on the inputs' which, apparently, just means using an AND gate on the inputs. Seems confusingly worded, but maybe that's a real term, I have no idea. So, the input components menu let you put in a constant input of high or low, or the two inputs the game was actually trying to get you to use. Unfortunately, both of the inputs you are supposed to use look EXACTLY the same, which could get confusing later.I never got to that 'later' to see if it ever got confusing because the tutorial is impossible to pass. After getting through the confusing wiring mechanic where, instead of just dragging the little nodes on the components to the input of another component, you have to draw wires between them manually by hitting 'W', I ran a simulation. For some reason, instead of just testing every possible input to make sure it works, you have to hit 'continue' after every input test. Whatever, minor inconvienence. Well. On the 3rd or 4th test, the simulation window said something along the lines of ""ERROR: Unable to parson JSON input on"". It just cut off at 'on'. I replaced and rewired the entire circuit, thinking maybe I had used 2 of the same inputs (I hadn't, I had seen different inputs when running the simulation, but whatever) and then it started giving me the error at the first test. Every time. Nothing fixed it. I gave up and refunded it.TL;DR - The game has no options menu to change resolution, aspect ratio, or to mute the music. Some of the components look exactly the same, which could make things confusing later. The tutorial is impossible to pass."
132,2439,"I am a electrical & electronics engineer. This app is just bad, the wiring is hard to use and not user friendly. It tooks longer time to make a circuit than using computer app. To make this better, I would suggest make it more user friendly. For those who are stuck, you can read books about Digital Electronics."
133,2439,"i got this and it looks interesting but some most things dont work for me and most of the time simulations dont complete and just stay stuck without saying if there is an error in my circuit or not so i cant finish levels and the things that you read and get components off dont fit on my 1080p monitor so i cant read instructions to complete levels and the whole game freezes for up to 30 secounds when i remove wires it shouldnt be happening on an i5 4460 and a gtx 750 ti that runs and renders 8k images on solid works and 1080p sonyvegas pro 13, adobe premier pro and affter effects with out a problem so i have requested a refund on this game but i might go back to it in a few months if it has been improved."
134,2439,I have been playing around 1 hour then i restarted the game. After a restarted I can't connect components by wires. When i'm pressing the middle button then i get a scroll sphere in chrome browser.  Please fix it! That's interesting to me.RadonTry pressing 'w' for wires.
135,2438,"UPDATE:Purchased this at release and asked for refund due to some issues that were met. According to the dev the issues were fixed but I have yet to retry everything again due to having some problems with my card transaction on Steam so it's not currently allowing me to repurchase the game. I will, however, be changing the review to a THUMBS UP for the reason that the developers are listening to the community and still fixing the game and also because it's a DAMN GOOD CONDEPT of a game. It would be great to see more 'Engineering' games coming form the studio.Having said that if you haven't read the other reviews then still be aware that it is an Online only game.I'm not an expert but I think the game is suffering from whatever engine it's running on. There was a problem with performance especially deleting wires and there is an option for playing it on a browser. Again, not an expert but if the game is natively running on browser with a windows 'wrapper' then that might be the reason it can't be optimized properly. If the game performance itself would be fixed then this would be the perfect game of its kind, or maybe the only one.----------------------------------  OLD REVIEW -----------------Wonderful concept - instant purchase. Doing the second tutorial but it's ""stuck"" in simulation. Pretty sure the circuit is correct but I'm not sure if it's still doing it or it's stuck since there's no indication on what part of the simulation it currenty is on.EDIT: Btw, just a note for anyone wondering since the gamelay is node-based, connections don't stick to the nodes so if you move a node to another place the wiring still is left for you to reconnect/remove.EDIT2:For anyone wondering about the 'bug'. According to the forums all you need to do is connect branching wires from the source itself not from any part of the wire. It's counter intuitive but it will get you going. Also consider that the optimization is currently very bad. Deleting wires take several seconds as experienced by other users from the discussions as well. I'm optimistic everything will get fixed and will update the reveiew if ever it gets done."

137,2438,"Hardware Engineering is an interesting concept, but unfortunately the execution still needs a little work.
