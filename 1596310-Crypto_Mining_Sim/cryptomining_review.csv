1,2757,"This game is not complex from my point of view.  Missing lots of things. For example on multiplayer you cannont see what you write on chat or what he answer. Also, suppose to be more challanging aginst other players to make the game more interesting. Find someting that make other want to play against like PVP, like against TIME or against computer."
2,2755,buggy mess and everything is client sided in multiplayer. roblox games are more polished
3,2755,"Full of glitches, no private multiplayer. Borderline unplayable"
4,2755,"buggy mess. everything is on the client side on multiplayer, can cheat engine in multiplayer. cheating in this game was more enjoyable than playing it normally"
5,2755,miney
6,2755,fun but i cant move my mouse without dragging it across my table tens of times
7,2755,gay
8,2754,"This game is great, if you are into crypto mining or are just curious about the process i would recommend getting this game. it is sort of similar to pc building simulator but in the crypto space with live price action for trading and current prices for gpus."
9,2754,
10,2754,terrible game the owner nor devs actually care about or care to update only care about making more money without the quality it takes to be worth anything this is just terrible and terrible design could have gone somewhere with someone or a company that wanted to make a game like this good instead of just grabbing cash
11,2754,  
12,2753,"i like how it use fast time so i can know what to expect, there should be a unemployed tally too to feel the passive flow true amounts"
13,2753,basic and simple
14,2752,ok
15,2752,Not worth the money barely even two hours of gameplay and I beat it overall L.
16,2751,"Can't really recommend this game. Seems to be pretty poorly constructed. I'll try to point out some of the design flaws.Game crashed and dupped the rig I was working on. I broke the game and I wasn't even tryingUI is pretty confusing. You can't tell what is buttons and what isn't.Inconsistent UI, i.e. you can sell Eth from the escape menu but have to go into the market to sell BTC.Outside of the tutorial, which is short, there's really nothing to do but let money accrue. Might as well be an idle game.Some store items show the price on mouse over, some don't. Instead of your mining room being a different level, it's just far away from the store, so sometimes you can see the text from your room hovering far in the distance from the store.All in all, none of these are terrible things, but put them all together and it seems like a game that was thrown together in a week and no attention was paid to detail. Then they charge $10 for it. Not worth it in my opinion. The only reason I have so many hours is because I just left it on, made a bunch of money, and bought all the best stuff."
17,2751,The games bugs have been fixed and its now a really good game but it takes a long time to make money but still fun
18,2751,it whas good intil they stoped uppdates (NOT RECOMEND)
19,2750,"i dont think the devs intended me to get this far, filled the entire room with ASICs"
20,2749,"Its a good game, Just need more updates."
21,2749,Game so realistic that it mines on your own rig :p
22,2749,I really like this game has a couple bugs where if you build in the same case it gives you parts already in the case not sure why but i rate it 8.5/10
23,2749,"Yeah there is some bugs in the game and considering that they are back! I have faith in them considering they are trying to make this serious and work,"
24,2748,So much that could be done with this. I have so many ideas to expand and grow this game. for now i cannot recommend due to how easy it is to exploit and get the best stuff early on.
25,2747,"okay game, a lot of bugs. I do not recommend you to buy this game because it's been almost 4 months and i haven't heard anything from the devs. Probably abandoned"
26,2747,"unrealistic, abandoned, overhyped, glitchy, and short"
27,2747,.
28,2747,gud
29,2746,This game is to boring
30,2746,Game is buggy and there is very little content.
31,2746,Wish there was more to do when your waiting to mine stuff
32,2746,"it took me less than 1 minute to realize how incredible cheap this game is. Devs are lazy too, no updates since May. Refund here I come."
33,2745,Game boring and fullfilled after 1 day nothing new and devs don't care about game
34,2745,looks good so far
35,2745,alright im going to be real with this game its not good and im not being mean just to be mean im saying that this game is not worth 10$ the graphics are kinda good but not the best and the dev is not working on this game anymore this game is the type of game you would play once or twice then forget about it i dont recomend this game as good id rate it a 2/10
36,2744,"Abandoned game, devs don't make updates anymore and the gameplay is boring and lacking content. you do the same thing over and over again after playing for 1.5 hours you can pretty much buy everything in the game."
37,2744,No more updates? ok fine guess ill just sit here and aimlessly mine crypto then(edit) Finally an update... annnnndddddd it sucks
38,2744,"Very Fun Game If You Like Tycoon Type Games, Still Needs A Little Work, But Could Be Something Amazing If New Things Were added, Worth The $10"
39,2744,"So I was having some fun with this at the beginning and was pretty pumped with the ""fast"" update that came out at first.Now its been a looong time since anything has happend to the game and I kinda regret having the game left open for easy money...Kinda want the refund lmao.Anyways its not worth spending money on as it is now. Save your money and get something else"
40,2744,It legit has not updated in 4 months like cmon really
41,2743,"ok so, this game feels like its in Early Access or even just a Demo. it has the fundimental functions it needs to more or less work, with a hefty amount of bugs. but there is so little to do and no real insentive to do so that it gets boring surprisingly quickly, so boring in fact that it it would be more fun to not play it. which is what i did. i can link you better Roblox Crypto mining Simulators, those accually include some gameplay. now to my short experience: the store looks quite full untill you realize there are copies of objects in the shelves to make them look fuller instead of making the shop smaller to make it easier to find what you are looking for. the tutorial, consisting of only a buggy checklist at the top of the screen, is the only objective/""Story"" you get, and once you bug it (exedingly easy) it wont help you anymore and just exist on your screen. assembeling racks is Annoying and not fun, and you get almost no money from them, so you would have to afk this as an idle game, but with graphics this good chances are you wont be able to play another game at the same time. what the game needs: content outside of only mining, like most simulation games, example: youtubers life, the reason thats fun is becouse there is more to do then only make videos. the game also needs an extra large dose of bug spray. power costs, rent, all the standard simulator stuff, sounds, some accual Goals. but knowing the way things go with games like this one its never gonna get another update."
42,2743,"not worth it dead game, dev did like 3 updates and then f**ked off, it was a easy cash grab. (well it seems after a few months the dev is back im not gonna change my review yet tho I'm gonna see what happens now if they put the effort in i could be singing a diffrent tune in a few months)"
43,2743,"Do not buy this, its not stated as an early access and is more like an alpha/early beta build.No soundNo GoalsShows power usage but power is free, once you fill the room its pretty much game over.staff have gone quiet over last 2 months. requested refund.May re purchase in the future if the game is actually finished."
44,2743,"its a lovly simulation game, tho it needs alot of work to be perfected.+ Its an easy to use hud and overlay, navigation and installation works well.+ Speed option x10 is wonderful for a passive simulator (BIG PLUS)- Dont really like the instant teleport to the wearhouse... i rather have order things through the Laptop.- I thought it'd be more variations of installations, perhaps it will come. currently its just loops of things i would love to see some sort of progression with this where you need to ""work"" to unlock new gear. Overall its a good passive simulation game, 5/10"
45,2742,"Dead game, literally a pump and dump."
46,2742,Abandoned super buggy game. There is a pretty creative idea but the game is unplayable at the moment.
47,2742,"Great game! Love this game, great to get started learning about mining before starting. Would love to see more content in the future (career mode, different warehouses, cooling. etc)"
48,2741,"TL:DR: not worth, aimless game. The content is interesting however the game is kinda weird. Shop is unnecessarily large and the items are placed 2-3 times. Either I couldn't understand the difference or there was no difference. Tutorial is not clear and if you dont go with the cheapest item at first, you would need to wait. Also the is no goal to complete."
49,2741,"The game hasn't recieved any updates in the past couple of months, but the game is okay"
50,2741,it's well whorth  the monney but ALOT of grind i hope this helped you make your choice to buy it or not!!save the $2500 as much a posible when at start!!
51,2741,"abandoned game, don't buy it."
52,2741,games developers came back which was rare very happy we will be getting updates very soon looks super promising
53,2741,First I think this is a good game but it has its drawbacks. Some of the drawbacks are that the game hasn't gotten updated for more than two months and there is really nothing to do with your money when you get the money except to reinvest it I think there should be activities or special items that you can get from the game using YOUR money. A nice thing about this game is that it runs smoothly on any modern computer but I think there should be some things to do with the graphics cards and have kind of like a leveling system so when you level up you unlock cards and you get rewards.
54,2740,love it
55,2740,i wouldent buy this game right now only due to the fact after 4 hours of playing you will have everything
56,2740,It's okay. Not worth the full price theres not much gameplay to be had until theres actually some meat behind the game.
57,2740,"With my tiny amount of game play into this, I can say for $10 usd I think as long as the devs keep going at this game it will be a super fun game. I love it so far but I can see me potentially hitting a road block within the first few days with content but that's from what I have seen so far (I will update this review if changed later). Worth it so far.Do I recommend? You got $10 for a random game? Yes, Its a fun little game for a cheap price tag.Do I think its a great game? Ehhh, it needs a lot more stuff to become something ""Amazing"" even if it comes to custom things or more options for the players.EDIT: It is official I played 9 hours straight and hit a brick wall with stuff to do. This game has a lot of potential but just isn't at the point right now. With more content added to this game from the community (if ever possible) or the game itself this game could be something really fun and cool to play with. I have found 2 bugs myself but besides that none are super bad or super game breaking. The normal preset rack with parts on it and the walk through the store wall behind the counter trick, the normal. Game needs to be able to have mods because the modding communities usually make these kinds of games so much better. Still a good game to buy if you wanna have a time killer for a day or two and maybe in the future, $10 isn't bad. Still a thumbs up from me."
58,2739,Fun
59,2739,Good game just needs more content and less bugs. Look foward to seeing it being developed more. Lots of potential here.
60,2739,"Before I slam this game for all the problems it has, I will say I'd be willing to revisit this after they fix the issues and make some enhancements moving forward. Pros - 1. Fairly easy to move forward with mining and building2. Allows one to redesign there room3. Offers a sandbox environment.Cons - (there are a lot!)1. Customer builds never seem to work, After accepting a task, building to spec, placing in customer pickup area ...nothing happens.2. Sometimes buying a rack comes completely assembled 3. Went to sell a worn ASIC unit and I ended up with a negative USD balance of 58+ billion.  (pretty much ended that profile)4. Assembly is clunky5. Graphics are meh at best6. No way to mine Litecoin, Dogecoin, or XRP (can only be traded)While I believe the game has potential, at this moment there are simply too many bugs to make it enjoyable. May revisit this at a later date. As for now,  4/10"
61,2739,Horrible bugs and not enough graphics settings to make the game look good.
62,2739,Almost 2 months and still no updates and no announcments about it so this is classic abondonned simulation game as always dont buy worthless so much bugs and more...
63,2739,"The game is fun until you max out on everything, which then the game just gets boring."
64,2738,only bad thing about this is the temp of my own gpu its a radeon r9 200 series and fans on 60 speed and i get to 75 temp for gpu
65,2738,7/10 Needs a few more thing like i feel like the ram should be easier to install in the PC/mining rig. the graphics are pretty good but there should be some more settings for the graphical side of thing. i think that there should be a tutorial for first time players because it can be really confusing at first. another thing that would be good is sprinting and some other stores maybe even somewhere where you can open your own shop. overall tho can get boring kinda fast.
66,2738,Yooooooooooooooooooooooo...
67,2738,neat
68,2738,"just got this game like a week ago, not even, played it for 4 hours non stop and enjoyed it all. Though i gotta say, it needs a tutorial instead of the side note stuff (don't get me wrong, that helps too but not enough) especially when the pci-e part comes into screen, if you bought a normal case like me, you won't be able to get past that step so you either A: have to buy the rack first or B: accept a ""mission"" and use a rack then.... OH also needs some more customization options for your room, like a whole color picker instead of just ""wallpaper"" and the prices would never be that high either... ps: there is not 1000+ GPU's unless you have to progress further into the game, there's only like 30 lol.... also need more motherboards/cpu's too i mine with ryzen 3 screw intel :P"
69,2737,I feel like this game can be so much better if there was more things added to it! I love the game so far its relaxing to play and just mine while watching some videos on youtube. Suggestions for the game that I have is maybe putting a way to build out own pc's that dont mine and let you run an OS (Operating system) so you can shop for parts online and or take orders through that. Also maybe upgradeing to a bigger warehouse so you can have even bigger mines.
70,2737,this game is amazing
71,2737,Abandoned game...
72,2736,looks cool and fun its just not my type of game
73,2736,"Game's still got several bugs; noting the discussions that the game might've been abandoned, I'm asking for a refund until this game has been further updated. If anything, this game should be in development phase."
74,2736,Great game needs more to do tho
75,2736,"if there is a mining simulator in nature, then this is definitely not this game. after 6 hours of playing, I already have 5 top ASICs and a rig for 18 3090RTX. The complexities of real mining are not reflected from the word in any way. GPU settings and moments with overheating are realized at the kindergarten level. Any number of GPUs is hung on the cheapest motherboard, works with 2GB of RAM. What is the rest of the hardware in the game for? To sell hamsters on orders with a wrap of 100%? Again, no. Everything is crammed into the cheapest case and put on the cheapest mother. And yes, fix the bug with buying a new case. When you buy a new case or frame of the rig, the same bored sniper b7 with a RAM, two 480 GPUs and a 7770 CPU is installed in it.$ 8 is not money, but until all this is brought to mind, even that is a lot."
76,2736,Small amount of content when you get the hang of it but I don't think you'll need that much content to get something great out of this simulator. Safe way to test waters in crypto or PC Building.
77,2735,"a lot of bugs, I keep buying a case and it comes pre installed"
78,2735,I Had a lot of fun with this game but i have done pretty much everything you can in 4 hours. Looking forward to future updates
79,2735,Really fun just needs more things to do
80,2735,"Although this game can be finished quite quickly and is probably not finished yet,it is very fun to play and would recommend 7/10"
81,2735,"1 hour in, still amazed at a game that contains everything i've always waited for someone to make in a game, it is buggy, but that is expected because it's in early access, i believe this game has a lot of potential, that is why i bought it the minute i saw it. 10/10"
82,2735,Developers need to pay more attention to the game. Has lots of potential buts needs a lot of work done to it. Game has its good and bads like everything. Honestly It's fun
83,2735,So much potential however the bugs make it unplayable. Would love to see more funding go into this to make it what it needs to be.
84,2735,"corrupted  saves, doesnt even work unrealistic systematic."
85,2735,this game so bored and more bugs. i think not worth it to buy this game
86,2735,This is overall a good game but after 3 hours or so i had 200k and had the best things i love this game but theres no need to buy anything other than the best graphic card and biggest case the other thinks dont effect anything i would love to see some updates that are giving you something else to do in the game as just leaving the game in the background at 10x to get more money and buy more rigs.
87,2734,"Decent game, Few bugs, Should add a Snapping system for Racks/Bitcoin Machines. More items are needed. Bigger Racks, GPU's are annoying to put in after a while. I had a bug where one of my bitcoin machines sold for -$1024000000, Add more GPU's. Bigger warehouses, Managing room temp, using AC units, add common events like storms (Powercuts) so you have to buy UPS's. There is also a text-sign at the ""Shop"" near where you but ""Racks"", Please events as the game can get boring after a short while."
88,2734,"Buggy, i lost 3 gigahash worth of gpus suddenly and every time i buy a case it suddenly auto builds"
89,2734,Not recommended! Just a few small updates and no new updates fixing the bugs in the games...
90,2734,It's like a weaker PC Building Simulator but with some fake crypto currency market attached. Terrible user interface and all around just a total mess.
91,2734,"To start off, i do hope this game gose on to be a top selling idler game. i will say it is not perfect. but its still good."
92,2734,Very slow at start than it escalates exponentially! With nothing to spend all that money on!
93,2734,NOOOOO -999999999999999 stars for you guys really? i had 100+ ASIC and 60 + 3090 rigs plus 1 mil $ now after loading the game to play i have - 244000000000$ after i sold one asic wtf :(( and all  missint rigs and asics :( now i need to start again plus my crypto do not cover ps thanks fro the bugs now i have infinite money yyeey
94,2734,"It HAD potential.  Very simple interface, lots of UI features that should have been fleshed out before game features were added.  Dev was good at first with updates, but it seems like he's abandoned the project and just bolted with the cash.  The game has a very large amount of work that needs to happen to make the game far less boring than it is, and to fix a lot of the bugs that keep coming back with each patch.  Looks like this isn't the first piece of unfinished or buggy software that this guy has done and then abandoned.  If the dev actually comes out of hiding, I can always edit this.  As it stands, stay away from an unfinished title and avoid anything in the future that this guy/team is involved with."
95,2734,this game is perfectly fine just everytime i make a pc for a customer then try to load os it just blackscreens and freezes.   i think you guys should give this game a go but maybe in a couple months when they update it a bit more
96,2734,lots of bugs well be a fun game ones they get the bugs fixed like how when you go to sell something that is broke and insted of getting no money you get like -550000000 and there for cant even play anymore or how you cant sell any of the casses ones you buy them
97,2733,"As good as the beginning of this game is and the concept behind it, there is a constant bug with one or more of the cases for when you place the components in the game. The bug I found was that things were copying when I buy any case, or things come with the case when I buy one causing the case bought unable to be sold in an attempt to remove the bloat of constant components. I cannot reccomend this game till this bug is fixed."
98,2733,dont buy a bunch of shelves it brakes the game
99,2733,"It is fun to set up your own mining rig and earning money by mining, building for clients or selling on the onlinemarket.But to call it a simulator is a bit to much.Some options it's missing is for example miner options to choose from.And more overclock/underclock options.There are overclock options but it's barebones. Maybe we will get more options to choose from in the future.I also would like to see the implementation of steam achievements."
100,2733,Mouse does not work therefore it is unplayable
101,2733,nice
102,2733,Love the game!!! Could Use some polishing but yeah good game
103,2733,"Are ya winning, son?                           "
104,2733,its very fun but you might wanna watch a youtube video first
105,2733,Grate game the only prime is I have maxed out my room  Im waiting for more updates
106,2733,great game!
107,2733,"Its not worth the Money atm, there is way to less content, you start grinding only after 1 hour, and only make money to get the same parts over and over again, also it doesnt really  matter how much Mh/J you got so pretty unrealistic and not a great ''simulator''at the end better wait for more content"
108,2733,"For the devs, keep up the good work! Looks like you guys know what you're doing. I'm excited for future updates :D"
109,2733,pretty fun if your into this type of stuff
110,2733,"very buggy.. spent the last 3 hours getting a farm going then out of nowhere the game freezes up and crashes. log back in and my farm is a complete mess, missing 40+ gpus motherboards are all different including ram,cpus, and storage, some cards got swapped for others. now everytime i buy a pc case it comes decked out already completely random of whether it fits what the customer order is, but now i get a fully built pc for the cost of the case. and placing anything on the racks is a major pain in the a**. but there is potential here. otherwise after spending 6hrs on this and losing almost all my progress i wouldnt play again."
111,2733,"A dumbed down PC Building Simulator clone for building mining rigs. Needs to be fleshed out with more depth, but it's an ok start."
112,2732,"This game is still VERY buggy, but it's clear that the developer has a path planned and with more buyers and the right community I think this game is bound to grown into a fantastic experience."
113,2732,"I like the graphics, the concept, and game simulation.I would like to have more components, specially graphic cards."
114,2732,good game but im not sure what to do after you get over 10000 coins/money
115,2732,its fun for the first 2-3 hours but then there is nothing to do if they added a rebirth system where is slowly got harder that would be fun or like a casino to wast money but once you start making alot of money its not fun they could also make harder difficulties and on the harder difficulties your electric bill is either way higher or way lower because I have several 18 rigs of 3090s and my electric bill is only like I think it said $800 or maybe they could add a option for fast breaking of the GPU's because each GPU lasts for about a year and a couple months in gameedit: they could also add different operating systems as well as CPU mining
116,2732,"was an ok time killer for about 3 hours, the devs ditched the game , its at best a beta so its buggy as hell......"
117,2732,good game but fix bugs please :)) 10/7
118,2732,its a really good game dont get me wrong but in 1 night i have everything so its definetly needing work but other than that its a good 1 time play
119,2732,"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME ----The developers seem to have abandoned this game. The last time we heard anything from the developers was early May. People have emailed the developers and have gotten no response. It seems the developers took the money and run or once the game got too popular gave up. Until more updates come out I would not buy this game as it is extremely unpolished and incompleteOrignal review (postive):Great concept, but the game is really glitchy and after a certain point boring.This should probably be listed as an early access game but I read the reviews and knew what I was getting into when I bought it. The developers seem to put out updates that fix glitches and add some new features pretty rapidly. As long as the developers continue to update the game and listen to criticism as they have been doing this game could easily thrive."
120,2732,"(If you like idle games, i can recommend it)Its like an short Idle game at the moment. Not much to do and not so much content yet, but devs still adding stuff. I played for 2-3 hours and can max out everything. I hope they add more managment stuff or other things to do or it will get pretty boring fast - No matter how many GPU's and other hardware they will add to the game. The only thing you can do is overclock your GPU's."
121,2732,i hope this game improve more this good simulation game more imporve
122,2732,money
123,2732,"I mean there is not much to do, and the tutorials are not that helpful but overall its kinda fun. I hope they add more to the game as of right now it is boring."
124,2732,player it fora few hoyurs beat te game to ez 
125,2731,it gud
126,2731,"cool game get repetitive after a while but its a pretty good game, need some more updates and it will be a good game."
127,2731,"good game over all, gets boring pretty quick, very easy to clock, needs more challenges and just more things to do. over all ill give it a 6/10"
128,2731,mine.
129,2731,"The game has been abandoned and no new updates since May, avoid this game at all cost!Lack of contents, unfinished, unrealistic and this game should be in early access.The game has a lot of potential I wished for, but in this current state you can get bored easily within the first few hours of playing.Not recommended until this game get more polished at least a year."
130,2731,100% still needs work but still fun
131,2731,"Gameplay Very good Good Nothing special Okay BadGraphics Masterpiece Beautiful Good Okay Bad AwfulAudio Amazing Very good Good Decent Okay BadAudience Kids Teens Adults EveryoneStory Lovely Good Average Not great NoneDifficult Just press a bunch of buttons Easy Significant brain usage Easy to learn / Hard to master Not so easy Difficult Dark SoulsGrind Nothing Only if you care about leaderboards/ranks Isnt necessary to progress A bit grindy sometimes Average grind level Too much grind InsanityGame Time Short Average Long Depends on you EndlessPrice Just buy it Worth the price Wait for sale Maybe if you have some spare money left Not recommendedThis game seems very unfinished with only a couple of hours of gameplay to complete it. As many other reviews suggest, the game should definitely be in Early Access as of right now. On the other hand, the game gets new updates every few days and the developers seem very dedicated. I will update this review once I can recommend it."
132,2731,boring!
133,2731,It needs to be too detailed. More products must be brought in. Different do systems must be established.
134,2731,"Not recommended, for now that is.Hope to see this game get polished, also IN WHAT UNIVERSE DO YOU NOT PUT THERMAL PASTE ON A CPU?"
135,2731,"Obviously it is a very simple loop so far but as a mining enthusiast IRL, I easily got 10 dollars of entertainment out of it.  Though the prices of the GPU's reflect the current scalper rates, it was nice to hold a 3080, even if only virtually!"
136,2731,"i think this game has potential it needs more work, right now I would say dont buy it im not going to ask for a refund and hope to see more improvements made."
137,2731,"i really love this game, ive got just for fun, well turns out that actually turned out to be the case, the games amazing! im looking forward to the updates in the future :D"
138,2731,Enjoyable game so far!
139,2731,"This game has a very good idea buts it's not good and looking at that the game is not in early access its pretty poorly made the cooling needs to be more realistic and there are too few companies of everything and the collection of the PSU section is pretty small and especially the function of the motherboards and graphics card slots are very stupid this game needs to be more realistic, and it needs more items in every category and the cases don't even have glass or an outer cover so pls do a makeover of the game bcs its good game idea but its poorly made"
140,2731,Has some bugs but all in all a good game and I cant wait to see what they add in the future
141,2731,Buggy mess... horrible graphics and the end game is sooner than you'd think...should be an early release title
142,2731,This game is a great idea and has potential but it is not worth playing as is today.
143,2731,"This game has a severe lack of content, and if youre not willing to pay for under 2 hours of entertainment then dont buy it"
144,2731,"I singelhandly completed this game in under 4 hours of gaming. I had very fun playing this game, but after only a couple of hours there was nothing more to do. i now hate this game. -rep"
145,2731,I think it's a fun game.Walking threw the shops racks is funny. Would like the orders process to be fixed.So that I can sell to customers. 10x speed is fun
146,2731,"This game has a lot of potential, but still can have more algorithms, such as Kawpow (Ravencoin), Lyra2eV3 (Vertcoin), and others.A GPU Repair function will be helpful too.BTW, to those who complains about the grinding, DO NOT BUY PARTS AND MINING RIG WHEN YOU START THE GAME! Instead, go and take the orders to make money."
147,2731,"Game definitely has great potential to become a great game with bugs being patched and new content being added, there is an issue where the character automatically moves the to left, might not be the case for all people, needs a bigger variety of all parts and should be accessed by either a more detailed shelf or a terminal that lists all the items that can be purchased and sort of create a list of things you want to buy, total costs and the hash rate, to make this game even more realistic; add rent, electricity bills and then the game might spike in popularity, would recommend this game in a few months once it has a lot of content being added and bugs patched"
148,2731,good game
149,2731,I love the game its sooo good and realistic daily updates new stuff.
150,2731,Isa good
151,2731,"For a game that has only come out 2 weeks ago its pretty good just in some places its a little buggy, it feels like pc building sim just with crypto mining and a crypto trading program that whenever you buy, the graph immediately goes to a sea of red that looks like satans erection, so the only thing missing on the trading part is adderall overdosing. Still overall great game I would recommend playing it just avoid using this to get good at trading."
152,2731,its a good game just dont buy racks those things are the devil in disguise and dont sell your bitcoin miners cause now im in debt 58 billion dollars
153,2731,I must say this game is great.
154,2731,Pretty good game but needs more. I got the top rig that can be bought in 2.5 hours. From there making more is incredibly easy. Also everything but the powersupplies and gpus do nothing.
155,2731,Pretty good game pretty addictive after 10 hours but graphics are amazing. Amazing game well made

First of all the developers must make money somehow to keep this game going and thats probably why its out. Second the game works fine, i have played this game with 2 friends and no one of us has experienced any gamebreaking bugs or anything that makes the experience a living hel. The game does not last for long tho, got 7 hours and i have already 400k and everything in the game, i recomend buying this game when its on sale and not at its current price since the game is to short but has alot of potentiall.OBS: This review is made by me (no  sherlock) and that is what i have experienced, this can be different for others since bugs can be quite random. Thank you for taking your time reading my review, i hope i was able to answer some of your question and made it easyer for you to deside to buy or not, have a great day/night!"
157,2731,"If 10 bucks isn't a lot of money for you, this game is enjoyable enough for a couple of hours. My issue is there isn't much of an actual game here, and it seems like there are a lot of missed opportunities. Even though this game isn't technically in Early Access, you should tempter your expectations as though it were."
158,2731,"Fun game, worth a try"
159,2731,"6 hours later...Grew a farm of 3080Ti's, 3090's, ASIC S19 Pro's and I make 300k$ per sold coins."
160,2730,I like it but it needs time to get better with better content.
161,2730,very relaxing just walk around and build.
162,2730,The game has potential but for its current state I just don't believe that it's really worth $10.00.There's little to do and very buggy in terms of tasks and placing your build in the designated spot.
163,2730,would be nice if they fixed the duplication bug ill buy a computer case and it will be full of parts ruins the progression of the game
164,2730,Look forward to see what you can make of this game.
165,2730,its ok but it has been abandoned for another game the dev is making

173,2730,incredibly addictive.. frequent updates cant wait to see what else they add.. gg
174,2730,"This game is unfinished and should be considered as early access. It's filled with bugs that makes it unplayable. anything beyond your first rig will automatically get deleted once you load the game after the save. I don't recommend a purchase at this stage until all bugs and progression has been resolved. Otherwise it's a fun to play 1 session kind of game.Edit: They fixed the save bug, now your rigs maintain. I'm in changing my review to positive as now it's playable. The team behind the game seems to be very responsive with bug fixes so I think it's worth to play. but you'll get to a point where you're just doing repetitive tasks. Has potential."
175,2730,No tutorial. Not even fun. Just boring as hell
176,2730,I had a set-up with like 150+ 3090s and when I loaded my save all my cases were empty. Fix the bugs are add more content then maybe I could recommend this.
177,2730,"It's okay for the money. Takes an hour to learn and then two to beat it.That is, I make enough money in the game to buy hardware faster than I can build rigs with it. Probably won't play it again unless there is a major update.There is no other endgame, building rigs is only profitable at the start. It's very basic, don't expect to spend more than an afternoon here. It doesn't have a lot of variety."
178,2730,It's pretty boring. I spent most of my time just waiting around for my rigs to make money.
179,2730,"I recommend you to buy Pc Building Simulator instead of this game. this game is just more basically and didn't finish product... it's seem early access because of recently release on April, 2021 so they're on work the processing..."
180,2730,"Not worth the money. Still a lot to improve, the first objectives where you need to connect a cable to your GPU for example, is bugged. Come back in a year maybe, when the game has progressed some (hopefully***)."
181,2730,Save problem has improved but fps drops instantly on auto save pls fix this
182,2730,gud
183,2730,broken saves currently . every load is broken and items just dissappear so for a management game that makes this hell unless you play less than a hour for one day .... aka the refund period.....kinda sus
184,2730,not much to do as it is. once you filled your first rack its just waiting for cash to roll in and buy a new rig...

There's no reason to buy anything aside from the cheapest of these parts.  Choices only matter when you're building a PC for a customer which you'll soon just stop doing.+ Watt-hours are tracked in game, but power is free and unlimited. If there was an electrical bill to be paid that could help give this game some strategy.+ There is only 1  location so far. Once you fill up the room with racks, the game is effectively over. If players could buy a larger room, warehouse, or own multiple locations that would also add depth to the game. Along with differing kWh pricing at each location, this could add to the min/max strategy.+ Location temperature should begin impacting hash rate performance at some point. Individual GPUs can overheat if you overclock them too high, but the room with all the mining equipment does not heat up itself. Smaller rooms should heat up faster, larger rooms should heat up slowly. Adding in different cooling solutions to control room temps would be nice.+ The price of items never change. It would be great if items could have their price go up or down depending on part stock availability.+ You should be able to buy multiples of items. If you want ten 3090's you have to buy them 1 at a time. Game UI needs more QoL improvements.+ Stats for each item should be visible on mouse over since parts do wear out.

No way to label racks.+ UI should be reworked to allow the player to see the pricing graphs for all the crypto at once.+ Add achievements. None at the moment.As of now the game is a bit barebones, but interesting enough to play for a short time.

200,2730,"This game is horrendously buggy. Things randomly disappear, you can't complete tasks because the objects wont interact/you don't have the available options/you do the task and don't get completion credit. The game also randomly decides to crash if you interact with certain things or do certain processes. Literally unplayable in this state. I ""completed"" the first set of tasks but could not get the credit for completing them, so I couldn't get rewards/do more tasks."
201,2730,"Bought this with my ETH mining payout from this morning. Enjoying the game alot no issues on my end not sure what other complaints are about. I just want more GPU options (3090s, RGB function, different brands of the same gpu). Also location upgrade would be nice. LIke when i max out this current room i can move to a small warehouse then bigger. Also more case options and fan swapping for RGB. Without RGB are you really mining? Also computer setup. The laptop is nice but allow us to build a custom pc and monitor options, keyboards etc. Looking forward to the progress."
202,2730,"VERY BUGGY, i had to restart multiple times. And when I finally got a save and played for an hour, my game crashed and when when i came back all my computer components were gone."
203,2730,buggy but has a lot of potential
204,2730,"Decent game, decent concept and enjoyable gameplay, however there is certainly bugs and a big lack of content, I'm not sure if the developer didn't know how to set it as early access, but it certainly seems like early access"
205,2730,"I played this game for just over 2 hours before I realized there was absolutely no end game. I guess that might be the point for some people, but I currently have like $250k worth of various coins and 4 full 18 GPU rigs with 3090's running the best overclock to get maximum performance without increasing wear. Only played for about 3 hours and that's about it. At least it wasn't that expensive and hopefully they will continue to update it. Would not currently recommend because it's just too limited."
206,2730,cool
207,2730,"Progress is not saved in the game. The game freezes momentarily when adding components to the mining rig.There are not enough computer components to choose from.Overall, the game is graphically very well designed."
208,2730,Really good game would recommend!
209,2730,5/10 Add Ryzen to game for 10/10
210,2730,"has a lot of potential, Pleeeeeeease please keep working on it and make it amazing. to those out there be wary it is still very much an unfinished product"
211,2730,"I'll start by saying that amongst all the Simulator games, this one in my opinion is between the coolest ones in terms of general idea, a Crypto Mining Simulator, I could probably lose hours and hours on that but...... there's a but.Even though the game looks fun and I haven't found any bug yet, it gets boring pretty easily: you can only mine 1 coin (ETH), no power management, limited selection of components, everything ends up in making the most overpowered rig you can, and watch it make infinite money. And that's it. Nothing else. I hope that those are just the early stages and that the developers will add more and more features with future updates, hoping also that the devs read the reviews, I'm gonna leave a list of what in my opinion should be made as a feature and added in the game:(in order of importance for what is my opinion)- Work around a power consuption management (add different power contracts that give you a determined amount of power for a certain cost, generators or whatever that makes the game more realistic rather than just having unlimited power, this would also make the game more challenging).- Add the possibility to mine other cryptos rather than just Ethereum, all we can do as of now with the other cryptos listed in the game is just trade them, which doesn't really make big sense (unless you're buying BTC and #HoDL in the game for years, lol).- Add the possibility to buy more rooms / spaces / hangars or whatever in order to expand the mining farms and not limit the playing space to the first and only room.- Add more components in the store, and get rid of those same components that are just places in different spots in order to make it look like there's a huge amount of types.- Have the possibility to get dedicated monitors for each individual rig, with maybe the on-screen console panel that shows the mining progress, and still the possibility to link the rig to a centralized control panel such as the one that is present right now.- Add an online marketplace (this might be hard but very cool to do) where players can list their new/used parts for different prices and let the economy run.- Add the possibility to buy and install external fan / cooling systems, that would make the whole environment cooler for all the rigs in the room.- Add different algorithms for miningThat's all that I came with after playing for almost 1 hour and considering all the different aspects and features that would have made me way more interested into keeping playing the game. I hope the devs will read this and consider working on some of those features (anyways considering also the other reviews, I'm really confident that they're already working on some new stuff).My current rating is a 5/10. The thumbs up is because I really love the idea and the general structure of the game, even though I'd like to see more and more features in the future. I'll keep this whole review updated as soon as I come with new ideas or the game gets new stuff to play with."
212,2730,"The idea itself is very good, however...Having a RTX 3070 with Ryzen 7 3700x and having FPS less than 20 makes my eyes bleed, not to mention having mouse sensitivity less than 0.1 and you're not able to change it... :')I'd rather play Cyberpunk which not to mention, runs better.I'll check back in a year."
213,2730,Overclock the PC to the maximum lifespan then sell it for 3800$ 10/10 would buy again!
214,2730,"It's really fun but you can be a millionaire in 5 hours lol so the 10x time should be removed because it makes the game 10x easier, there should be more options for the components, electric bill, maybe the PSU gets overheat and burns some components, there are many ideas to add to the game to make it more fun because for me 4 hours was more than enough for the game but it shouldn't be that easy."
215,2730,"Love this game cuz it really simulates being a crypto minerThere are many things needs to be edited an added and I will include them below:1: Same type GPU must allow you to synchronize overclocking settings.2: Scrolling up and down must be a lot faster.3: More PC components to select from.4: Add expenses such as rent, electric bill, and maintenance.5: Add the ability to use liquid cooling backplate to GPU's.6: Crypto trading platform must show the average price of your shares.If the above issues were correctly addressed! Then this game will become a lot closer to reality and would make it a little more grindy so we do not finish it withing 2 hours lol"
216,2730,"I feel like I haven't played this game enough to leave a review, yet it feels like I've touched all the content already...It's a short and a long game, although it feels like a one and done deal. You play it, get to a point where u feel satisfied, and then you quit playing. That's it, no saves, no credits, nothing.After that you might wanna try the creative mode, or freebuild mode as it's called. While the idea is cool, and brings some PC Building Simulator vibes, It's certainly not the same.The parts aren't free, nor do you have infinite money, instead you get a large sum of money that can get you far, like really far, but it's exactly the same gameplay, same tutorial, everything. Just replay the game with the biggest headstart ever, or basically just start where the game ends.There is not enough content to play this game longterm yet. One of the main things that is needed is a way to save the game. Also more missions that give it more of a campaign would be nice, as the current tutorial is a clusterf#ck. Also have some indication of what you need to do, as there was no indication of the controls, and I had a rather hard time assembling my first rig, and I did not know where the cooler went. This game has amazing potential though, and I can't wait to see where the updates bring it, assuming this game gets actively updated. The game has had 2 updates so far, but these aren't the major game changers it needs. Can't wait to see a big update arrive!"
217,2730,"Needs to be placed in Early Access with how unfinished and devoid of content it is. No instructions whatsoever. Building PC's are completely removed from reality. The shop is a mess, with zero logical adhesion to part compatibility and general store layout. Buttons that should work, don't.I get that this isn't meant to be another PC Building Sim, but the actual building aspect is so unfulfilling, lacking almost all user input, I wonder why it's even part of the game? Why not just order parts from an only catalogue, have some invisible entity build it, and then it magically appear on your desk ready to farm? I think 3 bucks would be closer."
218,2730,"An addictive game with so much potential.I feel a lot more variety with parts would greatly improve the experience, and also watercooling would also be great means we can push overclockers farther.Also there is no energy bills to pay? Keeping an eye on this."
219,2730,"The game is a mess - but has potential. Avoid for now until future updates. My issues:- Game not responding every time I place a customers PC in the box. I have to close and reload every time.- After reloading game, all my PC parts disappeared from my machine, didn't get refunded for them.- Tutorial will confuse people, It tells you to enter a PCI-E which is not possible / needed with a normal PC- Saves are buggy. I tried to delete my progress and start again, if you enter the same name, you start on the day of your old game."
220,2730,Unfinished product. Should have been early access or something like that.
221,2730,"Awesome game concept, just needs little bit of work. Developers listen to your community, and don't take critics offensive, rather use them to improve your game. I am giving this game 7/10. Good for spending time and waiting for trade setups to come :)I'd also suggest creating Discord server.Best regards."
222,2730,"I bought the game with 6,55 euros from the full price. I would say it's worth it and this game has a lot of potential. I don't expect much right now since it has only 5 days from the release."
223,2730,i like the game i will recommend to people if thy like pc parts and all that
224,2730,"If the developer sees this i would to talk to you about things us players would like to see in the future. Such as new parts like cpus, gpus etc."
225,2730,"pog, hope more stuff is added in the future"
226,2730,"It doesn't matter what CPU/RAM/Motherboard/PSU you install (ran 6x200W GPU's on a 500W PSU), the only thing that matters is the GPU's which is frankly boring (but also kind of realistic but not to this severe extent), there is no way to mine other crypto than Etherium, you can invest in other crypto which is based on a API that fethces real time prices. TL;DR Can't recommend now, too lackluster PS: Make the items in the store static"
227,2730,?When the game will update
228,2730,quite laggy
229,2730,"As a mining farm owner (7.5 GH/s) I find this game super fun. Also a bit educative for new farmers :) Super nice touch with the latest update where you can track/trade real life valued cryptos. However, at a point game become super easy with the fast speed. I wish time was also real-time. Besides, save system is a bit messy. When you load your game all GPUs switch between rigs itself <3"
230,2730,"The game has a lot of potential, but the amount of content at the moment is slim and about worth an hour. After 3.5hours its a pure grind for nothing. Im still going to recommend it as it only cost me 6 and still has a future!Edit: I'm pretty sure the game is dead, but I still have hope."
231,2730,The Game got potential. It runs on my potato rig. The down side is that the options are very limited and the bugs are really annoying. Hope This game improves and add more features
232,2730,Best !
233,2730,That's a no from me.  You will get bored very quickly with this.  Just not enough content or variation.
234,2730,Don't. Just don't...Like the idea. Poorly done
235,2730,"pretty good game, cant wait for future updatewould recomend"
236,2730,Very cool and fun! Can't wait for online mode + vr update
237,2730,I like it but it needs time to get better.
238,2730,"Decent, I think it will get better with updates"
239,2729,nice game
240,2729,Games feels unfinished.
241,2729,nice game
242,2729,Games feels unfinished.
243,2729,"This is actually a pretty cool game. Its the only crypto mining sim on steam that is actually done right. The game is in beta and there is not too much content right now. When you start a new game you have $2,500 and you start by getting a rig up and running. You can then take customer orders for builds and complete them for a pay out. You are able to customize your back room but not the front of the store. That's pretty much all there is right now. You farm ETH and then trade that for USD. The most recent update added real time coin values from the market. All in all after some more updates this game could be really good. Giving it a positive review for now for what it could be in the future. Totally worth 8 bucks if you are looking for a crypto mining sim."

247,2729,"yesssssssssssssssss, now i can mine crypto and don't pay bills so nice"
248,2729,"yesssssssssssssssss, now i can mine crypto and don't pay bills so nice"
249,2729,So far i have had lots of fun playing the game! i know there are lots of game breaking bugs making it unplayable BUT i cant complain knowing there is only two developers trying to fix such big problems
250,2729,"Fun, but bugged ,has  a lot of potential."
251,2729,The game needs a ton more content... after 1 hour i had 4 rigs put together earning a shed ton of cash.. the reason why im giving it a thumbs up is it needs a lot more content to make it a wholesome game and there is potential.... let this become pc building simulator part 2 and go from there.

256,2729,"After further review, as well as having played the game for a little longer, I've found 4+ bugs and haven't gotten any response from the dev. I'll update my review if anything changes."

258,2729,"Don't get me wrong, a lot of potential here.. A lot of detail in certain things, and building rigs is genuinely fun, so long as it wasn't glitching out when placing GPU's.. but that's it. The price of ETH never fluctuated, i couldn't switch miner software or algorithm, and while it shows balances for other coins, I could only ever mine ETH. No ASICs, and very limited selection of hardware. No real sense of power management, or anything to do with the building you're in. just some custom looks..It was fun for an hour, but I really hope a LOT more is added to this in the future.EDIT: This review was written before the Trading update (April 27). Seems some things have been added, keep it up, and I may change this to a thumbs up in the future when it feels like a full game."

260,2729,"Great concept, yet way too easy.. You are done with the game in 40 min.It says a lot of computer parts, but there is not.Nothing to customize for the miner monitor thing, just the hardware."
261,2729,"This game is moderately entertaining. Seems more like an alpha game than a product release. Settings is ""resolution"" on a scale of 1 to 100. Tutorial was alright but I have done actual mining so I already knew what to do. The 100x speed in the menu is nice. I was having issues starting one of my 18gpu towers so I exited to menu after selling a bunch of eth, loaded back in, the usd was there from the eth but about 24 3080s were gone, motherboard/CPU/mem in the first one didn't match what I installed and the motherboard/CPU/mem was just gone in the 2nd one. Adding video cards can kinda be a pain in the ass as sometimes you can see the boxes to install them, and then you'll just drop the card on the floor. For a PC builder, that was a huge cringe every time. I'd love to see the dev's do some more work on this, maybe push the client jobs for bigger eth systems sooner. TBH the hole thing got to the point it was just easy and all I was doing was building 18 rigs as fast as I could. There should also be something in there for 2000w PSUs since you can't actually power an 18x3080 tower up with the 1600w provided in the game. New location would be cool, maybe start in your garage, then buy a building, then buy a wearhouse. Maybe some asics for the bitcoin that's in the top menu. Maybe some IRL coin price linkage. You could have room cooling, power consumption, and lease prices all be part of it as well. Maybe even building maximums with upgrades from the utilities and the costs associated there. Lots and lots of opportunities here for more development and to really take this further. I'd also love to see better link mapping of the hardware installs (it can just be really hard to install the 2nd memory module at certain angles), maybe add power to the SATA SSD since you double tag the video cards. Building the motherboard, cpu, and memory outside of the case would be pretty cool too. From a logic perspective of the game I understand why you don't but it would be cool. Maybe even have parts dump into like a 'receiving' area instead of dropping just on the floor in the middle of the room. Dude, tl;dr it!:Good start to a game I'd like to see improved. If you want to see what crypto miner building is all about, this gives you an idea. Room for improvement but not a horrible experience."
262,2729,"Game has potential but is no where near finished. Imagine a crappy version of PC building simulator but with the ''mining'' aspect.Feels like a browser flash game.The game is so basic and i pretty much did everything possible in 20 minutes. no where near the type of simulator games that you are used to.The controls are extremely bad, even looking around is a struggle. This is mainly the reason i stopped playing."
263,2729,"I refunded product. This game has some potential. However there still needs quite a lot of improvements.The tutorial is confusing, there needs to be more options for the graphics settings, building a rig is tedious, I can't get a mining rig only a pc case, and need more computer parts. This isn't really as realistic as in real life though. In comparison to PC Building simulator, Crypto Mining simulator still needs to be improved. For the moment it doesnt shine as much as PC Building simulator as I would expect. I don't recommend buying this game now. Perhaps if the game is better in the future I might buy it again."

265,2729,game is fun but i would really love to see different algorithms and cmd screen more control of the mining rig more coins to mine and level up system

268,2729,"Easy game, fairly chill, there is some tutorial but its just a check box, so you need to figure out how to do things yourself.The building is very clonky, you need to walk around alot to mount the parts, right mouse button to assemble power cables. in the esc menu there is a 10x (it was 100x) time button that helps alot. Well its not like its pc building simulator but its kind of fun, but to easy to make money. No electricity costs and the shop is horrible. dont rly know if i could recomend the game.Sry if i have spelt some words wrong, was kinda drunk when playing and english is not my native language.*EditDid not expect to get updates so quick because of the pricetag.They have changed some things like adding a 2500w psu instead of the 1600w.The trading is kinda fun, ads to the realism.overclocking is kinda ok? You get some more mining/s but not to much.I would love to see that all the different cpus and ram would make a difference. atm you can have the cheapest cpu and ram and still get the same mining capabilitys as a more expensive cpu+ram combo.If they keep updating the game and add more stuff to do i would sure recommend the game. its a pity steam does not allow a maybe button between the thumbs."
