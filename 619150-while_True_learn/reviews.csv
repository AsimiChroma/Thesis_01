As example, the “while True: learn()” title hints to the traditional C-syntax concepts of program iteration, boolean evaluation, and call to a function, but none of these are really present in the game and definitely not in a way, that you would be able to identify them unless you know them already.When it comes to Machine Learning I do not see any relation to actual data processing, training and classification. A real-world predictive system would have no problems classifying a red circle from a green square when it has been trained with those exact shapes and colors. The real “fun” would have happened if it had to classify a purple star instead.Furthermore, processing time and transmission speed are major elements in the game, but are not given the credit to their importance in real world applications maybe because they are not tied directly to Machine Learning. I am really lacking a way to track transmission speed in the designs I make in the game, especially as it seems to be very important for the “startups” puzzles.In short, I will recommend the game for its puzzles, but the talk about demonstrating programming and Machine Learning principles I classify as “hot air marketing speech”."

Lots of razor-thin, literally tenths of a second, differences between medals, with no insight or lessons from the game on how to optimize. The input is easy to cheese with gamey solutions, and don't even get me started on how arbitrary the ""startup"" levels are. Once I hit genetic learning, I'd had enough. It felt more like the game was treating me like an idiot for trying to machine learn with the big boys instead of guiding me towards better understanding.It started off so strong, but quickly became a game for people who already had a degree in machine learning instead of a fun teaching puzzle.

Of course they could have, but they didn't. Like that ""Falling Dolly"" game of the early internet, this game is a version of a sick joke hiding behind a banal interface. The devs have made a game that discourages learning and encourages brut-force lockpicking.

Some of it's mechanics are just.. nonsensical. For instance,1. The maximum simulation speed is 3x, for example, which is a bit too slow.2. Some of the machine learning nodes have an accuracy that you must improve by giving the node sample data. This sounds interesting, but.. it's not a game mechanic. It just means you click ""training"" at the top, and.. wait. That's it. It might take longer depending on how much data actually currently reaches the given node. I didn't get very far into the game, but at one point I waited about 45 seconds until I saw the little % error number reach 20% (the minimum).3. Finally, and perhaps most egregiously, the input data and ML errors are actually totally random, and only a single test is run on your program. Considering the outputs often have a desired accuracy, and a desired ""filled"" state that is lower than the actual income amount of data, this means that sometimes, running the same setup more than once will give you different outcomes. That's not just something theoretical either, on one of the very first levels, I won using less nodes than the developer (got an achievement for it) by simply.. running the test about 3 times until just 1 node reached the proper thresholds for gold. There's a few other complaints I had as well, but those 3 stood out to me as very major. I should also note that, if you got this far and are still interested, this isn't a coding game. It's an optimisation puzzler. You are given nodes that sort shapes by various criteria at different speeds and accuracy rates, and connect them. If that all still sounds fun to you, give it a try. It's cute, I'll give it that."

I'd give it ""Neutral"" instead of ""Recommended"" if I could.For the machine learning they tell the history of it and have links to serios resources.But in the game itself I haven't found anything that is close enough to the real world. All the intersting stuff is represented as a single node, for example RNN (recurrent neural network) is just a single (i.e. atomic) node that magically does what you need. And when you ""train"" it, you just ""magically"" make it work better. It is probably hard to gemify this complex topic, but I hoped that developers will manage to do it better than they did.The game is still reasonably fun, just don't expect to get machine learning outside of the story and node names."

Spend time reading articles on Wikipedia or something instead.Pro: Nice artwork, good humor (especially if you're a cat person), and a laudable take on making a number of complicated computing topics more approachable.Con: The actual puzzles are weak.  There are duplicates (the setup/story might be diff, but the actual solution is exactly the same), or trivial extensions (take previous solution and add a 2nd component in serial).  The AI ones are confusing at best -- you kick off the training and the car gets stuck doing nothing, but eventually it says ""reached target speed"" anyways, and you end up running it and getting gold.  In general, getting gold most of the time (~70%) for various puzzles is fairly trivial, and there's very few that require any thought.For example, the last set of puzzles with neural networks require no thought.  You can choose from one component (a black box), connect the input & output wires, and you're done.  Then repeat it for the next puzzle, then the next.The UI could also use a bit of polish.  You can speed up the execution by 3x, but really should have a higher ceiling for when you're iterating on a problem.  More keyboard shortcuts would be appreciated as well."

To get Gold in the puzzles, you've got to become a QA line manager, categorizing the most inputs with the least amount of effort, duplicating the ""inspection lines"" that become bottlenecks, and occasionally throwing in a specific percentage of defective output to meet a quota sooner (! - but if the puzzle asks for 60% accuracy, you won't get Gold with 100%!)So, yeah: fun puzzles, and you  will  learn stuff... it just won't be much about machine learning, unless you do that on your own."

619150,0,0,76561197994819351,136,4,-1,8.8,"October 17, 2020","While I enjoyed playing this game, it was very brief and easy. But I cannot recommend it.I would give this game a 60%.TL;DR:- Not a programming game- Don't expect to learn anything- Pretty easy, but challenging if you aim for gold medals (max efficiency)- Weird game progression: game elements introduced, then discarded; Sawtooth difficulty- No auto saves (???) Make sure you save constantly because you can lose all your progression at any moment if you run out of money...I was under the impression this game was going to be a programming game like""Human Resource machine"" or ""7 Billion Humans"". But this is not technically the case.All puzzles are basically the following: You need to sort colored shapes from a random stream into specific categories. To do this, you need to create a program using and connecting nodes together.The twist is that the nodes you use are not the ones you would expect, and there is no efficient way to clearly identify a shape/color. It's up to you come up with the most efficient way (fewest nodes, best speed).There is also some puzzles that don't require you to be 100% accurate and allow a certain margin of error.This gives an interesting approach on how to solve the puzzles with a different mindset than the one you might use for programming (which I believe is actually a good thing).I was also under the impression I would get to learn more and experiment with machine learning techniques. But once again this is not what the game is about. The game vaguely mentions machine learning techniques (both incredibly dated and fairly recent), while providing you links to learn more about it.Most puzzles are fairly easy. Don't expect something incredibly challenging, except maybe if you aim for gold medals. In which case the puzzle becomes a balancing task to evenly distribute input streams to the output streams. This is frustrating at times when you're just one short for instance.You can also cheese some of the puzzles (infinite loops, using nodes' ""memory"" as a storage instead of trashing them, intentionally ""freeze"" your program and still get a gold medal (1)) which does not look like this was intended at times and could introduced completely undefined behavior when reused as a single node later one.(1) Later on in the game, instead of outputing a certain amount of shapes, you need to maintain the margin of error above a certain level for a certain amount of time to pass the level. This is extremely easy to cheese by intentionally slowing down your program.Some elements of the game are introduced early on and are extremely efficient at sorting shapes. Unfortunately, you don't get to use these later on. What was the point of introducing them at all? They are never brought up again either, even though they might be more efficient than solutions you can come up with without it...There is a puzzle that involves a ""genetic algorithm"" to solve a self-driving car problem. This is an absolute train wreck to be honest.There are many problems with this, but the most obvious one is that you have no idea at all what's going on.You are supposed to ""train"" and ""evolve"" your program, which is done automatically for you (except in the case of supervised learning which actually is the method that works the best in this game). But there no way to understand what's going on. This makes the learning process absolute trash. You can turn some knobs, like with the real thing, but the learning process and the outcome is seemingly random and it sometimes look like the actual learning is a complete regression.A way to visualize all possible agents, a way to properly define fitness (this is stupid to base it on average speed when you car will break at the last moment because frontal sensors only spot cars way too late), better sensor system (no way to distinguish left/front/right sensors of the car, absolutely terrible when dodging traffic...)For me this is the worst part of the game. Very frustrating puzzle with completely random outcomes, completely misses the point of what genetic algorithm and reinforcement learning is about.I also didn't like the ""startups"" puzzles. This is pretty hard to explain exactly what is wrong with this. But basically you need to complete a puzzle as usual, except that the reward is not a medal, but in-game money.The problem is that there is no way for you to gauge how your program is doing and what you need to do to increase the cash flow. There is the option to ""patch"" your program after release to potentially optimize/refine it, but this is useless since you have no way to measure what is wrong with it to begin with.This is fine since you don't absolutely have to do them to complete the game (even to get all achievements). But I think it's just a shame, since it could have been a lot more interesting (e.g. Changing the output after release, actual telemetry of why users are unhappy).In the end, I finished probably 2 startups puzzles since there was no real point doing it.Side note, I also had a bug where I generated infinite money with a startup even though the user rating was awful.Speaking of bugs, the game has no auto saves. There is a ""feature"" in the game where you lose all your progress if you run out of money. This happened to me right in the middle of a playthrough and had to start over from the start.Although there are checkpoints, your previous puzzles won't be saved (which can be used as a single node to simplify your code). Meaning you basically have to start over from if this happens to you..."

619150,0,0,76561198237577814,44,39,-1,16.5,"October 15, 2020","(work in progress, more to be added later) TL;DR If you're a computer programmer that sees application design in precise logical notation of programming instructions, and without borders defined by workspace, nodes (I'll explain what those are later) and time, this game is not for you. Attempting to approach this with a programming mindset will not work here. If you are a computer science student with a major in machine learning, you will be delighted with your purchase.If you have no knowledge of either, it's possible you may understand from the approach of a new student of machine learning. It depends on whether you can grasp the concept of machine learning.DISCLAIMER. i HAVE 20 YEARS OF PROFESSIONAL I.T. EXPERIENCE, NONE OF WHICH IS MACHINE LEARNING. THIS LACK OF UNDERSTANDING ABOUT THE LATTER MAY BIAS MY REVIEW, BUT CAN SERVE AS FODDER FOR THOUGHT IF YOU ARE PLANNING ON PURCHASING THIS GAME AND THINK IT IS A PROGRAMMING GAME.I gave this game about 15 hours before rendering my decision to recommend or no. It certainly deserved a long trial. The game is about a machine learning developer who is having trouble with designing applications. His cat however seems to get the concept of this and was able to fix what the developer could not. Astounded by this discovery that his cat can figure this out, he attempts to build some kind of interface so he can talk to his cat and glean the knowledge the feline has in his walnut sized furry head.Look, I didn't write the story. I agree it's a preposterous one, even though I myself am a cat lover.Anyways, the story of how the developer attempts to talk to his cat progresses by trying to complete puzzles through the building blocks of machine learning known as nodes (explained a little later).Try being the operative word, in bold and underscored. It really does not do a good job of doing that. The game's interface is a little all over the place, having features and tools buried in areas not mentioned in the tutorial and only later do you learn they are there by accident. Before I contine, what are nodes? As a programmer, I find nodes hard to describe. They're not coding instructions, more like black-box subroutines (procedures meant to perform a specific task) with an input and an output. You can connect nodes with wires in a sequence to solve the puzzle. The puzzle itself has input and output but it's not exactly what you call a file or even a comm port. It's more like a bucket meant to hold a bunch of things like numbers or shapes. While the tutorial explains what to do with the nodes,  it fails on why the nodes are used. Allow me to explain. As a programmer, I understand for example what a conditional branching instruction (like IF THEN ELSE) is and does, but I also know why it's useful. It's a way to change program logic flow conditionally rather than a straight start to end run. I also know what object orientated programming is, and also the value of learning that form of application design. Each puzzle tells me what to do but really not the why. This does not help when nodes are being taken away from me and replaced with new ones after I am introduced to them. I don't get the chance to use the nodes as an assemblage of tools in a growing library. Add on top of this the many restrictions on designing a machine learning solution this game introduces:* The number of nodes I'm allowed to use (depending on whether I'm aiming for a bronze medal solution or a gold one)* The physical size of the workspace* The runtime required for the solution to complete successfully (seriously?! am I on a VMS system here?!)I find I'm either running out of runtime, running out of allowable nodes, or running out of workspace. I honestly thought Zachtronics TIS-100 was a bugger with limitations.The aforementioned nodes are not really useful as building blocks for application design. Maybe that's how machine learning is supposed to work, but it makes no sense for example to make a node that appears to have two choices for parsing data yet still allows a third, fourth and so on to be unfiltered and flow into either of the two decision streams. As a programmer, the pieces should fit together but in the case of machine learning, I'm not getting the glue that puts it all together. Again, as mentioned in my disclaimer above, that's probably because I am a coder and not an abstract thinker like a systems analyst. In any case, this game is for machine learning experts or at least their very clever fans. Programmers and those unable to grasp the abstract thinking of machine learning might find this a frustrating purchase."

The puzzles are really repetitive and they feel disconnected from the plot, essentially just building a machine to sort different colored shapes into boxes. I tried to get a gold rank in everything and found some puzzles frustrating, simply swapping two identical connections would sometimes change the result enough to drop your rating.As a puzzle game it doesn't really stand out from the crowd in any way, and the learning aspect, while present, is mostly tidbits of information with links to outside sources if you actually want to gain some useful knowledge. Maybe gaining access to higher level technologies will make the game more interesting or educationally relevant, but 9 hours in I'm ready to give up already and just go read a book on the topic instead."

This is very close to how modern AI works, so it's on-theme. It also makes it a different flavor from Zachtronics games.The Bad* The writing is pure cringe.* It is sometimes impossible, or nigh-impossible, to get gold rankings on some of the challenges when you first encounter them. Instead, you have to wait until upgrades unlock and you can improve the parts. This is in comparison to Zachtronics where the only upgrades are to your own brain.RecommendationIf you can find it on sale (5$-ish), or enjoy Zachtronics but want a different flavor, then it's fine.

The game doesn't seem to want to be understood, and a lot of the second half of the game just feels arbitrary and opaque, with gradient nodes and training periods that reduce the error levels of your neurons that aren't really optional and are just an extra step you have to do before you can actually start solving the puzzle.The game's abstraction of machine learning is just too abstract. The error levels and randomness sometimes reward you a gold medal as though by RNG instead of by puzzle solving, and the upgradable nodes mean some gold medals are just near misses until you go back over them at the end of the game with faster processing speeds unlocked.The startups are actually pretty cool. I'd like to see more of them. It's actually pretty neat how you have to figure out via trial and error that it's sometimes better to have a slow program that only serves a small percentage of your users than a highly-parallelized but very expensive program, although even that's a little iffy because the rules the game uses to determine earnings feel a little off, like it's only considering how efficient each packet is rather than considering overall throughput.The reinforcement learning / genetic algorithm self-driving car segments are just awful. Poorly explained and uninteractive, you wind up just setting sliders at random and crossing your fingers. I think the dev thought the gritty bits of genetic algorithms would make a game slow and boring, but they abstracted it a few steps too far and wound up just making a black box with buttons and levers that you can push that might have an effect, or might not, who knows?The educational links were a nice touch but the game itself isn't really a great introduction to the concepts beyond the idea that you have different processing nodes that each do one thing and they are linked together.On the plus side the cat is adorable. 10/10 for cat cuteness."

In most puzzles, the main challenge is allocating a small pool of colored shapes among bins in very precise ratios. (And, no, this has little to do with precision/recall/any other metric - it's more like: make sure between 40 and 50% of red triangle inputs get in bin A, and the rest go in bin B.) This is initially sort of amusing but quickly becomes boring. I would love to see a machine learning game that actually engages with the topic, and I think there could be some interesting puzzles or resource allocation challenges set up around training data selection, recognizing and avoiding overfitting, etc. Allowing more flexibility in user solutions and moving to Zachtronics-style scoring rather than the medal system this game implements would also be huge improvements.There are better puzzle games than this one, better programming games than this one, and I doubt this game will teach you much about machine learning other than occasionally linking you to some supplementary reading.

619150,4,0,dunkelziffer42,250,34,-1,10.5,"July 29, 2021","The idea of turning deep learning into a game is really good, but the game is so abstract that in the end it's just a puzzle game with a pasted on theme after all. If the puzzles themselves were interesting, this would still be a recommendation, but sadly they are not. All you're doing is sorting colored shapes (red/green/blue circles/squares/triangles) into outputs with varying goals and building blocks. You'll encounter sorting blocks such as:- a sorter with two outputs that can direct one color to output A and another to output B while distributing the third color randomly- a sorter with two outputs that can direct one color to output A and the others to output B- a very slow sorter with three outputs that can split the colors perfectly- a sorter with three outputs that could split the colors perfectly, but has an error margin- a sorter, that needs to be trained first by putting a gradient block in front of it to reduce its error margin- a sorter, that needs to be trained first by creating new generations/mutations of it to reduce its error margin- a sorter, that needs to be trained first by putting a gradient block in front of it to reduce its error margin, but which also has completely useless - yet annoying - inner connectionsDid that sound repetitive to you? Well, probably about as repetitive as the game. It's a nice idea to depict deep learning as a sorting puzzle and try to introduce blocks that mimic gradient descent, genetic algorithms and recurrent neural networks. But in the end, training the blocks has absolutely zero challenge and is only there for the theme, but it makes the game 10 times more repetitive.So, are the puzzles at least difficult? Well, most of them aren't, but some of them actually are. Sadly, most of the time for reasons that are even detrimental to the theme:- Often, you have a FINITE supply of colored shapes to sort into the outputs and each output has a TARGET amount of shapes it has to recieve. In the harder levels of this type your main focus becomes getting enough shapes to each output and sorting becomes secondary.- Sometimes you want to parallelize your solutions until you notice that load balancer blocks are actually the only thing that costs anything. The cheapest thing in the real world is the most expensive in the game and your actual neural networks are for free? That's stupid. Well, if it would make the game better from a gameplay perspective, I could live with that, but that's not the case either. It's just another random decision.The final ingredient of the game are a multitude of links to websites about AI-related educational resources. If you wanted to motivate someone to investigate these topics, simply giving them this list of links would probably be more effective than making them play this game.Maybe this review as a whole sounds more negative than it should. The game is most definitely not complete trash. It has a solid basis, but it would have required a few more ideas to make the blocks actually work similar to their real world counter parts and to make training them an actual puzzle itself as well as a game design overhaul and a rebalancing."

If it was just abstract problems and facts about real-world machine learning technology, I would probably like it a lot. I love optimization puzzles, and I'm often looking for a new one.However, the story elements underline the worst parts of silicon valley startup culture: unquestioningly implementing technology for morally ambiguous or downright evil clients, and ignoring one of the main failings of machine learning technology: reinforcement of existing biases when constructing and training models.There are multiple startups that you have the opportunity to work for, and they're practically necessary if you want to be able to afford new hardware to get the best scores on earlier problems. When I got to one which is a caricature of a despotic dictator asking you to help create a tracking system to send political dissidents to concentration camps, all couched in tongue-in-cheek barely-veiled euphemism, I'd had enough (not to mention the dictator's name had ""baboon"" in it, which I think many would agree with me is quite racist, given the racist trope of comparing Black and brown people to monkeys and apes).I find all of this especially concerning given that it's clearly aimed to appeal to a younger audience, who are still developing critical thinking skills.I'd say if you're looking for a puzzle game based on how computers work, check out Silicon Zeroes, SHENZHEN I/O, EXAPUNKS, or TIS-100. Unfortunately, none of them specifically feature machine learning, and each of them focuses on much lower-level (in the computer science connotation) computing."

I got trully irritated on how many times the game removed the ""If...Else"" node option just because it wanted for you to create solutions using more complicated and less effective nodes.

For example, some puzzles can only grant a gold medal once you've later purchased hardware upgrades. Maybe that's meant to seem realistic, but it doesn't make for good gameplay when you beat your head against the wall for an hour trying to find a solution which doesn't exist.This design problem also leads to some greater systemic issues. For example, ""startups"" simply don't give enough feedback to understand the mechanics, let alone use them well. If your user base isn't growing and parallelization doesn't help, there's no visibility as to why that might be the case. And you can't retry them either as they just go bankrupt and you're left scratching your head as to what went wrong.And then there are bugs on top of this, such as a solution working just fine until a save is loaded and then no longer growing the user base for no obvious reason. Or cut and paste suddenly stopping working. Or cutting and pasting randomly rearranging all of the connections.This could have been a decent programming-like puzzler, but it just doesn't get there."

They do a great job with the feel and style of the game. I like how they use a real world problem approach to the puzzles and that they give you rewards for solving them. But those rewards should be aesthetic and not required to add marginal upgrades.  I have several questions; Why is the game 'grindy'? Why are not all puzzles solvable with the tools given? Making the user obtain marginal upgrades to go back and solve past puzzles. Why are some higher level puzzles reliant on RNG? (I understand real world heuristic applications, but this will push away novices and students, and that is not what we want as a field.) It seems that these measures were put into place to add replayability, but will add frustration to the novice user.If you are looking to getting into Computer Science and Coding/Programming there are several games here on Steam that are great as well as other free and paid resources online."

Most Zachtronics games can run well into the double- or triple-digits, and this game inhabits a similar genre. That said, even a mere ~7.5 hours into this game, I'm baffled by the design choices that were made for the gameplay. Here's just a few reasons why:  The difficulty curve is a nightmarish rollercoaster. Some of the most finicky levels I encountered were followed by single-step puzzles with a solution I'd previously learned. You're given tools that - so far, in my playthrough - you're very rarely incentivized to use, because they will always be far slower than the simpler functions. Lore-wise, you're given cutesy flavor text about programming self-driving cars for sentient cats in one level, then Orwellian descriptions of political imprisonment in the next. It's all over the place. No matter the data you're sorting in-universe, though, 99% of the time it shows up on the UI as red, green, and blue shapes - so why even bother? Why are performance upgrades even a thing? It raises doubts about whether gold medals can be earned on the first playthrough of the level with clever building, or whether the only choice is to return after upgrading. If performance upgrades ARE a thing, why also tie exorbitant amounts of money for cutesy decorative tat? Why are startups essentially ""golden parachute simulator?"" It isn't fulfilling to try to make perfect code the first time, discover the company is failing anyway, then try to bail before it crashes. Unlike every other level, you're not allowed to try again once the company folds, unless you start a new save file (but then you have to do all the other levels over again). Why are Schemes faster? Why are DLLs faster? Why?I could go on. I want to like this game, and I admire the aspirations to educate that no doubt inspire it, but as a product - as a videogame - I'm not having very much fun so far. Looking at the reviews, most people also seem to hit a dozen hours or less before moving on.I would implore the developers to get really good play-testing of this game, start-to-finish, asking at each point whether things are flowing smoothly. It's been rough going for me so far.Not recommended."
619150,0,0,ultramarino,298,32,-1,1.2,"June 27, 2020","I think this is the first game on Steam that I don't recommend. Just following the main story, in less than an hour, at certain point you have to train an 'AI' to drive a car, and it's just a broken mess. It pops some arcade mechanics out of nowhere, that just feels buggy, but one cant tell if its the game or oneself missing something. Finally I gave up and went to check several YT gameplays, and confirmed the broken state. I'm afraid this game misses something, either poor communication of some hidden non explored mechanics, or just publishing without knowing about it. Maybe Dev just tried to over simplify it too much, and didn't use fresh and competent beta testers to point out the flaws and user experience. Maybe Dev did, but didn't listen? Just makes me sad. I just asked for a refund. -- Please note: Maybe as you read this, the game has been fixed? But, how does one know without paying first?"

Puzzles that require you to not just understand the mechanics, but discover a new behavior by combining or abusing them. There's only one or two instances of this discovery I can remember.2. Determinism. To go from a silver to a gold on some levels, I just needed to swap identical pieces around until the game decides an item will go left instead of right, or that it takes 0.2 seconds less.3. Multiple ways to solve a puzzle with different strategies. Most levels in first half of the game have a predefined solution that you're just creating, and it doesn't open up much later.That said, I think this game is charming and it introduced me to some new ideas.

If you do like them, maybe you'd like a challenge and this type of sorting and weighting strikes your  fancy.I own this game since early access and used to be on the fence with the label ""machine learning"" – because sorting colorful shapes is not machine learning per se. But a working solution often depends on accuracy and weighting (how much from what goes in which ""pot"") to actually work and then it starts to get clear, how the aforementioned machine learning is actually true.And especially the weighting part can get tricky - how many shapes and colors do you have, how many of a specific color and or shape do you need to sort? Do you test for color before or after that? And how to divide the load until every target gets the right amount? Even then you might realize that your solution is too slow and everything can be done differently.Is that game now for you? Good question.

619150,14,0,DMentia,461,22,-1,5.1,"May 28, 2020","This was a tough decision.  On one hand, the opening hour or so of the game was awesome - creativity, humor, and an actual story are rare in games like these, but they clearly tried, and it shows with a very polished first hour.Of course, obviously, things went downhill after that.  Part of what interested me in this game was that it looked like there were lots of minigames and other things, like the self-driving car shown in the videos.  Turns out, the car minigame is the only minigame there is.  Not only that, but it's very broken/buggy; the 'requirements' for your car are just that it needs to drive at a certain speed (and for the first 5/6 of the car missions, that target speed is the same speed the car starts at), so for all but the last one they just accepted it immediately without ever having to 'evolve' the model.  Which is weird, because they wrote custom systems just for these 6 or so car missions, and then the first 5 of them don't actually require you to do anything with them.And then they kinda stopped adding new mechanics or doing anything interesting towards the end of the game - every 'puzzle' feels like someone just randomized which colors/shapes you need to output, and I stopped reading the descriptions long before the end because they're pretty much totally unrelated to the puzzle.  And even when you do get new mechanics toward lategame, they're just new ways to do the same things you've been doing but a little fasterMostly, it feels like they put a lot of effort into hooking a new player, and then just kinda threw the rest of the game togetherAnyway other than those gripes, it was mostly a pretty fun game.  I liked how you could get upgrades to your PC which would give you small, 1%-5% bonuses to things (which really didn't matter in the end but was still a good distraction from the endless samey puzzles), the start-ups were a neat idea, and I liked the medal system vs the Zachtronics style of 'optimize one of these three parameters'.  If you really like these kinds of games, this one's unique as far as they go, but otherwise I wouldn't recommend it."

While not terrible, there are better games like this out there.Solving the same problem multiple times, yet not being able to import a prior solution or sub component in a practical manner is a huge drawback. Regular need to retrain learning components where it serves no game purpose is time wasting, and even more annoying, is that in some special cases, the components are pre-trained,  so the dev clearly identified that it was a pointless pain but didn't back fill the fix elsewhere.  And some of the Evolutionary Learning Machine problems are merely exercises in trial and error, since the controls are insufficiently documented and process is unclear. Broken links to external articles and video links were also an unfortunate problem.I also wish they did a better job of explaining the real world operation of a number of the blocks and components. I have read other material on machine learning previously and it was disappointing not see the behind the scenes logic fleshed out here.On the plus side, the visual block editing and layout is a well setup.

619150,9,0,EpsilonRose,006,11,-1,7.3,"July 3, 2021","I wanted to like while True: learn(), I really did. The design is cute and the premise of a game about machine learning is extremely interesting. Unfortunately, there are too many problems for me to recommend it.So, About That Machine Learningwhile True presents itself as something of an educational game with an ML focus, but that theming is only skin deep. Most of the puzzle components are meant to represent concepts found in ML, but once you get past the basics there implementation becomes to abstract to really work. For example, you have to ""train"" a lot of the more advanced components, but you don't really have any control over that training or it's outcomes. You just run the puzzle in a training mode until the error percentage drops enough. The game also pop-up the occasional historical article on ML and related topics, but they're all fairly short and provide little insight on either the field, as a whole, or the puzzles you're currently working on.With all of that said, ML is a fairly complicated topic and I'm not sure its entirely reasonable to expect a game to really teach it with any degree of depth, so it might be better to evaluate while True as just a puzzle game, which is what I will do for the rest of this review. Unfortunately, even by that metric, it still fails pretty badly.(Quick Note: Over the course of this review, I will sometimes refer to using code or functions. That's just a convenient way to refer to solutions, or parts of solutions, given the nature and theme of the game. At no point is actual code or programming involved.)Puzzling FlawsUpgradesOne of while True's more subtle, if pervasive, flaws as a puzzle game is that it has an extensive upgrade system, which unlocks both new components, for puzzle solving, and improves the performance of your components. This might not seem like a major problem, since none of the core puzzles require any upgrades to solve, but it's not clear if the same can be said for getting a gold ranking, especially on optional puzzles. Normally, in this kind of game ,if you fail to get the highest marks, it's because you failed to understand part of the puzzle and your solution was flawed. Once you factor in an upgrade system, however, there's always the possibility that you failed because you simply didn't have enough upgrades or, conversely, that you succeeded via brute force rather than skill. Both possibilities are frustrating and they're by other flaws that make it hard to tell what happened and why.Reuse That CodeLuden.io wanted to teach that reusing code is a good habit, but the way they went about it causes more problems than it's worth. For starters, the entire thing is very clunky. ""Reused"" code comes in two varieties: actual reused solutions, which are just copies of your solutions to prior levels, and DLLs, which are like custom solutions that you can bring between levels. Importing old solutions is probably the more straight forward of the two. Unfortunately, it's also completely useless the vast majority of the time, because all of your old solutions are specific solutions to old puzzles, not generic tools. For example, data comes in three colors (red, blue, and green) and an early puzzle has you filter a mixed input for just red data. That's all fine and dandy, but it's also completely useless if you actually want to filter for green data or blue data or if you want to do something other than discard the other colors. Sure, you can technically rewrite the old code for the new color, but at that point you're not really reusing the old code, are you, so what's the point?DLLs, on the other hand, are more generic. You create them as their own, while on any level, and can import them into any level ... sort-of. The sandbox for creating DLLs is a little bit confusing at first, but by far the biggest problem is that it will give you access to every function you have unlocked, while puzzles will hide any reused code that contains functions they wouldn't normally allow. This means a clever solution for one puzzle might be completely unavailable in another, despite still being applicable. Again, this means you're stuck rewriting code, rather than actually reusing it. To add insult to injury, you initially start off with only 1 slot for DLLs and slowly unlock more through upgrades. This guarantees you'll be rewriting code every time you want to use a DLL, because why not?Should you find a piece of reused code that actually works for you, you'll run into a new problem: The inputs and the outputs aren't labeled. That's not a big deal if there's only one or if you're doing something simple, like evenly splitting inputs, but if you're output is at all complicated you'll need to either encode the nature and order of the outputs in the title or you'll need to repeatedly check the old solution to figure out which type of data corresponds to each of the tiny green arrows. So, why would you ever use these features, you might ask? Well, the simple answer is they're faster. A solution contained in reused code will run faster than an identical segment implemented manually, even if that ""solution"" is just a single function. When the main difference between a good result and a mediocre one is time, that's a pretty strong incentive. It's also a fairly obtuse one and, like the upgrade, detracts from your ability to judge the actual quality of your solutions or the reasons for your successes and failures.To be blunt, that sort of incentive should not exist in a puzzle game. If the developers wanted to emphasize reusing code, they should have made reusing code more convenient than handcrafting a solution every time. After all, that convenience and reliability is why reusing code is good, not because copying and pasting lines somehow make them run faster.A Lack of FeedbackFeedback is an important component of any complicated puzzle game, doubly so if optimizing solutions is also a major focus. Unfortunately, while True provides terrible feedback, especially compared to other similar games.For starters, the only way to get any feedback is to run a solution to completion or timeout. This means there's no way to get a partial analysis of your solution. More frustratingly, it's possible to fail a puzzle fairly quickly by not distributing data between outputs correctly, but simply running out of inputs doesn't end the trial and stopping it early prevents you from seeing the results, so if you want hard numbers you might be stuck waiting for a while as a timer ticks down and literally nothing happens. This wouldn't be too bad, except the time limit for bronze can be more than double gold and there's no way to view past results without recreating the solution and running it again. So if you need to double check which of your outputs got 5 extra packets of data, so you can try to redistribute them, you could be stuck twiddling your thumbs for minutes per actual attempt and setting it to 3x speed doesn't help nearly enough.What Difficulty CurveThis is more subjective, but even when taking all of the other problems into account, the difficulty curve is all over the map. Some of the early puzzles are frustratingly obtuse, requiring careful use of reused code or careful calibration of component accuracy, while later levels are completely strait forward and easy to perfect, even bonus levels. Also, before anyone asks, no I don't mean you can have a meaningful effect on how a component's accuracy changes, I stand by what I said earlier. It's just that you can sometimes create faster solutions by using less than maximally accurate functions, so sometimes you might want to stop their training early. Not that there are any tools to help you figure out when this is the case or what level of accuracy is optimal, meaning brute force trial-and-error is your only option, assuming you don't just look up a solution online."

619150,8,0,irrotation,414,25,-1,2.6,"May 23, 2020","The puzzles further in are really frustrating, as you need to play around with the probabilities to get the gold medal. The data sources often include uneven data sets, which is fine, but often you have no idea how the data will actually flow out until you have done some prototyping, and actually seeing the order. This is really bad as the order can break or make your solution, and more often than not you need to dance around some surprise bottle-neck introduced by sudden surge of blue squares, or drought of acceptable values introduced as the red triangles you were sorely counting on for that gold time are at the back of the data flow. It really does not help that some blocks, such as SIFT, introduce more random to the equation, making it really hard to predict how your solution will fare. Sometimes you still end up with pretty good solution, but then have no idea how you could possibly optimize it further to get that one second off required for gold medal. The blind trial and error required by the game is disgusting.The UI is horrible. The input and output blocks are locked to sides of the screen, which limits the amount of space you have for your solution by a ton. You are able to zoom out, but that only makes the inserted blocks smaller, and the text in blocks becomes unreadable really fast. If you zoom back in to read the text, the blocks grow in size and the lines become a huge mess. The line management is awful, and there no way to avoid criss-crossing the lines. It would be really big help if you could make some nice wedges to the paths, or reorder the outputs, especially in SIFT blocks.I liked the tidbits on machine learning, but I don't really feel like I'm any closer to grasping machine-learning than before starting the game. The story seemed kind of fun, but is very bare-bones. The store and the start-up business thingy felt really out-of-place, and I would have really liked if the devs would have rather concentrated on how to make the UI and the puzzles less frustrating. There was lot of potential about the game, but as things stand I would not recommend this to anyone. There are a lot of better puzzle games around, and those interested about machine-learning are surely better off learning about it from elsewhere."

If you're looking for something purely educational I would recommend reading a programming book, buying a RaspBerry Pi, or  better yet going to one of the many programming websites with free tutorials. If you like simple puzzle games with fun stories I would buy it; in someways this game reminded me of Donut County in spirit."

The framing of the game is based on cats, and the game provides cat outfits, cat toys and cat jokes as rewards for your success. I personally feel I don't enjoy cats enough to properly enjoy this game. From the beginning to end, I felt like about 70% of it was lost on me. If the usage of the term ""purr-fect"" instead of perfect is clever to you, this game would probably suit you.It's basically a simple module based sorting game, which allows (forces) you to use different modules as you continue. The puzzles they put together were decent enough, some of which required you to really break down the count of the sorted objects then balance them into their final spots. I did complete every puzzle with a gold rating so I can't say I wouldn't recommend playing it.In the end, I wouldn't buy it again, but I could see how other people might get a kick out of it.That would apply doubly if those people were obsessed with cats."

It's silly, it's cute, it's fun.But ultimately I felt it wasn't that satisfying. There wasn't a lot of programming involved; levels felt repetitive, and also shallow. I was disappointed as I got to the end of the game because it felt like a lot of the levels were just ""plop down these few pieces, and you're good"". The cat theme was cute but I don't feel it had much to do with the actual game. I encountered a soft-lock bug that made me need to shut the game down from the task manager (I think I was pasting a dll in that had other dlls in it). The game experienced slowdown on some levels even though it's only displaying 2D circles and squares and triangles. I never clicked on the links for resources in learning about real-life programming, because I wanted to play the game instead. They might be useful.Again, I'm not saying 'stay away'. If it really strikes your fancy, like it did mine, give it a shot. I don't regret getting it, I had a bit of fun, and I'll probably go back in to try some of the side-missions again that I haven't completed. But it's also far from a must-buy, and if you're looking for (in my opinion) more tightly-laid-out programming games, check out the many offerings from Zachtronics Industries."

The visuals are nice and engaing, the cat theme is funny and interesting, but as a game it just does not work for me.First of all, the premise of learning more about ML and AI is unfulfilled for me. Yes, there are cards and links to explanations, but the game itself does not in any way explore or try to explain ML and is just a generic puzzle game with ML themes and names.If the puzzle aspect of the game was well done, I could turn a blind eye on the educational aspect - but even the puzzle game is not very well executed. There are a couple well designed head scratching levels, but most levels are either too obvious and easy or too random.Even the special levels (AI-driven car and startups) turn out to not be so fun - the car puzzles are just too random without any obvious input you can provide in and the startups are bugged, so after a certain point you cannot improve on them (and this bug has been in the game for at least a year and still isn't fixed).As much as I wanted to liked this game, I just can't recommend it - neither as a puzzle game nor as an intro to the wonderful world of Machine Learning."

Every puzzle is represented through the same shape and color combinations and solved with the same nodes. That three different datatypes can't be filtered in some sensible fashion really rubs me the wrong way - even if it might be realistic there is no sense of accomplishment, every solutions feels like a dirty hack.The other big thing about the game is, that you are supposedly learn something. That is questionable at best. There are links to other websites, but the game itself doesn't explain anything at all about what you do. The fact that there is no connection in representation to you current problem and no clean solution (like I already mentioned) means, that you can bumble through the levels."

What do all the numbers mean? How do you predict latency and throughput? It's not clear, yet you need to know that information in order to get 'gold' ratings for your solutions - so that just ends up as really unsatisfying trial and error. Improving and optimizing solutions is usually the most satisfying part of this type of game, but that is not the case here. Puzzles also seem pretty repetitive, which I think speaks to a lack of interesting interactions between the various mechanics.It also doesn't really deliver on the promise of helping you develop an understanding of Machine Learning. The puzzle mechanics are  really just loose and superficial analogies. I've learned a lot more on YouTube than here.I think it's a good effort, the developer clearly tried really hard... hopefully they will do some great work later in their career when their game design skills have been honed a bit further."

Also hardware progression is dull and game would be better w/o it.

The game is less programming and more similar to the boring parts of being a network admin. You're just doing load balancing.  A puzzle will want you to get 20% of the blocks into bin A, 30% into bin B, and 50% into bin C, and you have to arrange your splitters in such a way that the proportions come out right. When you get a ""learning"" node, it's just a splitter that makes errors, and to lower the error you have to run data through it. It doesn't need any particular data, or feedback, or to be arranged with other learning nodes in any way, you can literally just run random data through it and dump the data into nowhere and its error rate goes down.  This is neither entertaining or educational.There's also a mechanic for ""upgrading your hardware"" that really doesn't work well in the context of this kind of game.  Grinding for better gear is okay in an RPG, but in a logical puzzle game where you're trying to find the exact optimal solution, you can be banging your head up against a wall trying to figure out why your solution isn't working and it turns out you got it right you just have to go upgrade your processor.  Imagine playing portal and you're trying all kinds of angles and ideas to get up on some ledge, then it turns out you just have to go grind previous levels and buy 5 more jump upgrades so you can just jump up there, and that's the only way to beat it, and for the whole game there is no way to know if you're failing to think of something clever or you just need to muscle through it by buying more stuff."

I usually enjoy these kinds of logic/coding puzzle games, but unfortunately was a bit frustrated by this one.  CPU time consumed by your ""code"" is one of the level passing criteria, but it wasn't clear to me how the seconds left on the clock mapped to blocks in my code diagram.  For example, on ""Toy manufacturing"" task the simplest maximally parallel solution does not beat the clock, but some arbitrary other graph with with more blocks in series does.  Huh?  I also think the claim of ""learn how machine learning really works"" is an overstatement.  There are links to external videos and materials that teach the real deal, but you won't learn that by playing the game, which is only loosely inspired by machine learning.

I personally found it frustrating, unhelpful and made me feel stupid. - The difficulty curve is all over the place. The central path is sometimes so routine as to plop one thing down, hook it up and press play. While others are so stringent on their gold criteria as to seem impossible.- I often didn't know why my solution wasn't working to reach gold. The feedback from the game is terrible. There is a lot one has to infer that isn't called out: ratios, order, accuracy and efficiency are either not talked about, or talked about in a separate window without context. Sure, one learns these things over time, but they are hard to truly understand. Which makes succeeding and failing very close to one another.- Then you try to learn by watching a youtube vid, or read the forums, and the difference from the solution that made sense to me and what makes gold, is so minor as to be opaque to be understood. It's a shame because they're trying to teach something, and I'm just not learning - even by copying.- There is no guidance in the startup missions other than a single tutorial message right at the start of your first one. I often didn't know whether to patch, why to patch, if people were unhappy due to the speed of my process, or the cost, or just the end of the cycle. Some start ups I made a killing, others I immediately lost money from day one... even though it sure seemed everything was working as efficiently as I could make it. A little prompt on the first few to tell me why users are leaving, or what I could do in a patch to help turn it around would have been really helpful as there are dozens of ways to solve these challenges.- Repetitive sameness in the challenges despite mission fluff text. Obviously there are only so many ways I want to sort 3 shapes and 3 colours. 4 hours in was my fill. You're essentially filtering. That's all you do: Filter inputs of colour and or shape. You build up widgets that have rules to how they filter, and time and time again you'll find yourself  separating one colour from the next, one shape from another. They add a couple wrinkles, time of widget's filter and accuracy of output... and if there is more I apologise, but I didn't have the patience to wade through the sameness to reach that newness.- Game doesn't provide moments to use what you learn. You can make snippets somehow and use them in other missions... but you cannot edit them. I don't know when I can make those snippets. There is a DLL tab which is also a thing you can make on the side and bring in. Why would I? Don't know. The game's store (all in game currency) wants me to buy another DLL tab. Why? I don't know why I should bother with the first one.Now, perhaps you're super smart. Already a developer. Can understand their intent simply by what they have called things. In which case, this may be your bag. However, if  you're just regularly smart. Felt the game loop of 7 Billion Humans was good and fair, and liked to feel empowered as you learned ever more complex things and made your way up each floor. Wouldn't mind a little bit of hand holding when you need it (and in-game thanks... I don't want to interrupt my play session by not playing and reading forum posts or watching other people play on youtube) . Then this may be more frustrating than enjoyable."

619150,11,1,war-wizard,466,38,-1,0.7,"December 26, 2019","As disappointing as learning what machine learning is really about.If you're a developer looking for something that challenges your algorithm designing skills, this ain't it.If you're not a developer but interested in learning what machine learning is about, this ain't it.This is just a logic puzzle game disguised as ""visual programming"" with a narrative loosely (and inaccurately) following the history of AI.Remember those ""edutainment"" games from the 90s? Mediocre and uninventive puzzle games that tried to feed you unrelated knowledge between levels? This is exactly like those."
619150,45,3,gonumen,96,14,-1,12.9,"December 26, 2019","To be honest I'm kind of disappointed with the game. At the very least it was on sale (It's worth maybe $5, nothing more).While the idea behind it is very interesting (using machine learning to solve puzzles) the execution is sloppy and leaves a lot to be desired. Almost all of the levels are based on putting coloured shapes into right holes, only the way you do it differs (think very simple SpaceChem). At the beginning of the game you can only use slow, primitive nodes to filter shapes and colours. Early levels are very easy and require little to no thinking. The game peaks at the middle of the story and then it goes downhill; fast. You don't get much more nodes than those that were available from the start (and you can only use ones that the devs allowed). Eventually you are introduced to nodes that are supposed to represnt real-life machine learning algorithms like genetic algorithm or neural networks, but they are actually pretty much the same filtering nodes that you already have but with added error (the outputs also have an error margin). You will also have to train them just like in real life except it's literally nothing more than a filler. You can connect everything however you want, press ""train"" wait a couple of seconds and copy/paste the trained node. I don't see any point in that other than being a filler. The last few levels try to add some more machine-learning related mechanics but they also fail miserably. You, again, have to do some filler moves (connecting the node to itself to imitate how it works in real life, and god forbids you forget about it), wait for it to train, copy/paste and add a filter node to direct coloured shapes into right holes. There are also few levels that introduce reinforcement learning but it's also limited to doing some thoughtless moves, changing a few sliders, playing a minigame and waiting for it to ""evolve"". There are many animated elements on the screen so that it looks like a lot is happening but in reality nothing is.The startup mechanic (another way to make some money) is also very confusing. On one hand it looks like those should be extra-hard levels that you will be gratuitously rewarded for but on the other you can just brute-force them, copy/paste the solution so it works faster and forget about it until it doesn't make profit anymore. You can also spend your money on cat skins, visual upgrades and four different node upgrades, two of which are useless if you think about it. (Data transfer speed and queue size won't solve bottlenecks).The devs also attempt to teach you how machine learning algorithms work but unless you already know them their explanations won't be of any use.Only side quests are worth doing as some of them actually require you to think about it but other than that you can finish the whole game by trial and error.All in all I cannot recommend this game unless it's on a big sale (less than $5)."

A game presenting scenarios with oppression and straight up commission of crime as cheerful programming tasks.I only got so far, some of the puzzles seemed repetitive, others seemed like unintended blackbelt level challenges where the challenge wasn't in the problem as stated, but rather using a finite set of instructions to do a task they are not suited for, under constraints that would make it difficult with the proper tools (which you lack).  As a programmer, I've never seen a programming task as inept as that.   Gameplay, for as far as I got?  Mostly ok, though it looked like it might get repetitive, or force you to do tasks while lacking the proper tools for the task.  ""Put widgets 8 into bin 1, 12 into bin 2, 30 into bin 3...  using tools that are ignorant of math....""Educational content: Low/mid.  The actual gameplay itself was sparse on educational content.  It used words that meant things, and explained what those things did, but the gameplay itself avoided the detail of how those things did anything that they did.Game morals/ethics: Toxic.  It broaches the topics of politics and ethics in ways that I strongly prefer to avoid in anything of even a quasi-educational nature that is not itself classed around politics or ethics.  This game is trying to present itself as a puzzle/programming related game (ie, neither politics nor ethics).  That right there killed my interest in the game, and did so horribly quickly."

619150,1,0,76561198346962237,60,15,-1,11.5,"November 22, 2019","Very interesting idea and also fun in the beginning but soon gets repetetive, boring and pretty annoying. Quite often the solution of a task doesn't involve logic but simply trial and error. It might be just me but I never quite understood why certain solutions didn't work whereas others did. Consequently, I failed to identify and understand the logic behind the game, even though I would not classify myself as a programming noob. If you are looking for a puzzle game and love to try every possible combination only to find the one that does the trick even though this solution might  be unexpected: go for it. If you are looking for a game, however, that is solely based on logic and allows to solve tasks directly in the first try once you know what you do: don't bother to by WTL.EDIT: after additional 7 hours of playing I finally got so annoyed that I uninstalled WTL in total frustration and anger. Regret to say that WTL is a pure waste of time and money after all. What this game lacks the most is a proper manual! Best example: how am I supposed to run any of the startups if I don't know what's really driving their profit?! I would expect that backload should have a major impact, but to my experience that was only minor. Sometimes very simple layouts generate profit but sometimes they just don't. Too often it's just trial and error, see if a layout works and if not reload an earlier savegame, with no real hunch of what the solution should ideally look like. And then there is this stupid gameplay. Best example: that annoying training thing you can do on nodes. What's that supposed to do after all?! I mean, it's just bloody annoying because most of the time you drag a node on the layout (catout or whatever stupid name it was given in the game) just to press training over and over again to get its accuracy finally down to 20% anyhow. That's just so pointless! Not to mention that incomprehensible learning algorithm for that self-driving car task for which you can adjust parameters such as population and percentage but you just don't know that their impact is.I understand that the game is supposed to teach something about machine learning. I can hardly see how that's achieved here. All you do is drag nodes and connect them, sometimes with intermediate steps. That's what I would call puzzle-solving but not machine-learning. This game is definitely overrated and not worth the money."

I parallelized program when profit was going down but to no effect.Some puzzles are just trial and error. A lot of times you will end up in a state where you sorted shapes and colors correctly, but you have 15/16 greens in top one and 17/16 greens in bottom one.Getting back to previous levels to get more stars can often mean using same solution with just upgraded hardware."

The average human mind resists complexity, finding the things which are simple and intuitive most comforting. Games like this allow a person to make complex things more intuitive, so that they can see beauty in them. It's really hard to do that unless you can make the required repetitions fun. This game has accomplished that. If more people can gain an intuitive understanding of complex systems, it is probable that fewer will be intimidated by the subject. Greater understanding makes for a greater world. (Also, there are cats! I look forward to the quantum AI sequel, where the cat only has a probability of writing a successful algorithm until you open the box it's in... What fun!!!)"

Not recommended for anyone interested in the technicalities of machine learning.Specifics: [Reinforcement learning levels could be greatly improved as the sliders seem to barely vary outcome. ""Genes"" are shown nowhere, mutations are not described. Sequential models (end game) are the most trivial thing with no skill involved, this make you unlock a huge portion of the the end of the story without doing much work, making beating the game feel really unrewarding. Doing my best every time, the success of startups seemed entirely random, with all of them being successful, however some of them lasted months, others only a week.

619150,1,0,76561197980609477,552,11,-1,7.6,"October 19, 2019","To me, the game feels hollow... The mechanics feels a bit backward...On the startup system, you get so little information and feel like you have so little control. It's not clear to me that there is anything to consider once you have something that seems to do the job, except for at one point adding a load balancer (but never more than 1!)... You will get a bunch of red users but adding more balancer will just make things cost you more...I keep feeling that it's the same puzzle over and over again, look at that, i need to split in 3 colors and then do some split according to shapes! How completely unlike the previous 4 startups(sarcasm)! How do i split in 3 colors, of course I use 3 decision tree. Sometimes it's a little bit varied, but the same patterns come over and over again...The whole processing cost of things makes no sense. If you have a chain of 50 components, they all do work at the same time, yet the processing time is the same as having a single component... But if you decide to have a load balancer, then the cost just doubles... And if you add another one, it doubles again? So you quadrupled your cost to at most triple your output. That's just not how anything works, and makes everything feels somewhat contrived.At one point, some puzzle are about literally like tricking your stats to get what you want... You could have 100% accuracy in both outputs, but then that means one of them doesn't get enough results (because there isn't enough data for it), so lets just make my setup literally more complicated to mix some results and have lower accuracy in one of the box, but get enough entries. That makes no sense unless you are trying to cheat your customer.And when you get to the point where you just add nodes randomly and change lines because you need to get some more then nodes at X row, just because the game wants at least X nodes there... It just feels like the goals the game evaluates you on are not thematic, and the game won't really help you deal with those goal.I wanted to like that game, I play many programming-like game but that one just doesn't click.To clarify that I gave the game a chance, I got up to the genetic algorithm with gold everywhere (and every side task)."

619150,18,1,76561198001956648,55,2,-1,5.4,"October 10, 2019","Started interesting but got worse the further I progressed. I finished the game in the 5h playtime, that's ok for what I've paid.I usually like programming games but this one isn't as fun as it could be.What I disliked:- Startup mechanics unclear. When the red user number got bigger I tried to parallelize the program but didn't affect the number at all. So I stated to skip the starup tasks. You don't really see how the written program affects the startup at all. - The rnn (at the end) is really boring. It's unclear how to connect the nodes (why do I have to connect themselves twice without any logic) and I really don't get what the desired output should be. If the node is trained it it will succeed. - The training of nodes in general seems broken: once trained it can be reused in later levels, why do I have to train them again when I use a new node? Training doesn't add anything to ge gameplay except it's boring to wait until the node is trained. If it is trained the gradient error thing can be removed. - I always had enough money to buy the additional nodes / upgrades. - I don't get what the cat skins and the entourage are used for. Seem to be visual only but cost money which should be better used for the upgrades so I never bought any.- one level doesn't have the trash bin so you have to back feed the unwanted items into the system again and stay there forever. Doesn't really make any sense.- some of the nodes are so slow that they aren't really used- you can't get gold for some level until later when you have bought upgrades- descriptions of nodes are wrong: for example the decision tree shape node is: ""This node compares socket's shapes with element's color (wrong, you can only select shapes). If an element's color (no colors! for this node) is equal to only one socket's color (sigh, not a color node), the elment modes to that socket. If an element's shape (oh now it's a shape node again?) satisfies both conditions, it moves to a random socket"". This is like beta or eraly access stuff which should be fixed a long time ago.All in all it seems unfinished. I had to check if it was an early access game but it's not. It would be ok for an EA game."

I'm sympathetic - the scope of the topics being tackled exceeds what many programming games attempt to each but in the process it is oversimplified to the point of not really giving much understanding or accomplishment at all. The middle module got interesting?  At points even frustrating. The start and end were too easy.  Multiple levels in a row could be solved with the same rote solution at times.  The art and story concept are great.  The writing could use a little work but I found it mostly charming and fun, the grammar/translation/editing needs another pass.

The only criticism I have is that it can get a bit monotonous after a while as the game does tend to abstract all the problems down into sorting shapes and colours. Saying that, there is a reason AI specialists get paid a lot of money, and it is a necessary simplification of what is an extremely complex subject. For me, enjoyment of the game fell off significantly once it hit the last few problems and started dealing with RNNs and temporal prediction - to me this last section just seemed 'tacked on' and didn't really add anything other than perhaps a certain amount of confusion on what the actual aim was. Overall, a fun game with a few challenging problems. It won't turn you into a programmer or AI specialist, but it may introduce you to a different way of thinking about things."

You're basically writing very basic, repetitive programs visually.  Sort colors, sort shapes, split data and either good for understanding basic logic structure...or flexing on people who aren't familiar with programming..  For $9 or as part of a bundle, it's worth it.You basically have 9 data types, and need to move them from the left of the screen to the right of the screen. The most 'interaction' between different data is when you're trying decide if you want to just cheeze the probability or do something more elegant. Protip: Cheese everything, the fastest/laziest solution is usually the best. Also, avoid load balancers as they double costs. Usually you can cheese it by splitting an input two ways with a color comparison set both types to the same color. 50/50 spit of all input. Not nearly as fast as a load balancer, but works almost as well."

That was the point when I gave up on any gold medals and was simply relieved to finish a puzzle.I also found the concept of reusing elements not explained well enough. Can you really connect the old red square load balancer to a new machine when you feed something into it that is not red squares, although the output boxes are labelled ""red square"" only (in this case, yes you can!)The customer letters are a fun part but do not relate to the problems you have to solve as they are again about your basic colors and shapes.I actually had more fun doing some of the programming games  from Tomorrow Corporation ( Human Resource Machine, 7 Billion Humans) or Zachtronics ( TIS-100, Exapunks, Shenzhen I/O) that are more about classic programming. You might like this game, but I'm only getting the urge to play the mentioned games again, So thumb down."

Each level rewards you with a medal (Gold, Silver or Bronze) which only serves as bragging right, and some money, which is required to buy some Hardware without which some gold medal cannot be achieved (yes, you will be revisiting early levels, and just press [PLAY] again just to see your old simulation run faster than before and grant you that gold medal... Wahey!).Oh, and you also need to factor in ""accuracy"": if an output requires more of a specific data than input has to offer, and that output has a low enough required precision, just wire in some useless crap, and behold as ""it just works"".(Yes, in this game, throwing random data to achieve 100 data sets at 50% accuracy is sometimes better than 50 data sets at 100% accuracy)While building your system, and running it to see how it performs or where it may fail, you'll be overjoyed when you realise that you can't pause the darn thing.Want to check load balance? let it run until the timer for bronze medal runs out, and you'll get the ONLY log you'll get to see in the whole game. No error report, no pause, no stats of any kind... the game doesn't WANT you to learn anything, it just wants you to play with blocks and coloured shapes until finally you meet the arbitrary requirements for that gold medal.Some blocks are introduced and never seen again. Some blocks literally make no sense.Oh, and have fun watching your blocks ""learn"", and by that I mean, wait until a red number becomes green without any input or configuration from you.Also, don't trust the numbers on those blocks, the time it takes for them to process data is painfully not accurate.As a small puzzle game, it can still potentially be somewhat enjoyable, maybe, for a very short while, but maybe for 2 eurodollars, not more, as it won't last past one or two playing sessions."

Unfortunately, startups have a bug preventing your solutions from functioning at the correct speed.  This means you will lose in game money, and real world time, as you struggle to fix a puzzle solution that may have nothing wrong with it.While this doesn't prevent you from enjoying most of the game, it isn't uncommon to encounter startup levels.And there is absolutely no notice that the levels do not function as intended, so until you get frustrated enough to google a solution, you will have no idea."

I do find myself doing a lot of basic division in my head to optimize the builds and get the good results, and I sometimes wish the game had some sort of tool for some of this... Or just hints.A few more hours into the game, I really find myself wishing there was some rating system that might explain why the ""startups"" succeed or fail. I assume that how well they do is bound to how well you coded them, but the game never explicitly tells you this... I just know some of them continually make money and some of them crash and burn.With the normal levels there is a much more explicit explanation of why your constructed system is either good or bad; Accuracy of the results, run-time, number of nodes etc. With the startup-levels it is very difficult to know exactly if you're doing well or poorly, and why."

Which is good, because I shudder to think about this being someone's introduction to programming.What made me quit after only ten minutes was the third or fourth level where you're forced to use a previous solution as part of your new solution. There are a couple of reasons this was a problem for me. First and foremost, it forces you into an inelegant and overly complicated solution for the problem given, and this in a game where you get rated for your performance. Secondly, the interface for including a previous solution gives no indication as to what is included in that block unless you edit it, which takes you back to the level for which that solution was created. In other words, you can't see your whole solution at once, even though it's an incredibly simple task with only a few nodes. Or if there is a way to, it was not intuitive nor clearly indicated.It's like this game wants to be a Zach-like, but completely missed the point on what makes them fun.

The puzzles are negotiable with a little bit of thought and a hand full of trial and error.  It would be nice to get the option to an explanation of why the solutions ultimately worked. At one point you get to participate in a pizza business that eventually starts to lose money, with the instructions to bail out if profits start to suffer, but doesnt explain how to bail out of it!  Then after it tanks the game tells you that you should have pulled out of it earlier, but again,  it doesnt tell you how to get out of it. Most explanations of the logic functions are external links to web articles and youtube vids that are general in nature and are not applicable to the actual task you are working on.  Like explaining apples to work on oranges.  I like that the game gives you some some brief histories behind some of the functions and the logic that made them possible, that makes some of the puzzles a tad bit easier to grasp, but its still a lot of trial and error with nothing to explain why the solution was correct.  This is not a game that I will be playing much again, if at all.  The cat angle is cute, at first, hey i like pets, but it gets as goofy as the left leaning politics in some of the back stories the clients give you.  They are simply not needed and only shed a dim light on the game and devs.  I think this could have been a a little cooler game without it.

The UI can be a little buggy, and it doesn't really get much into how the ARMA and RNN units process their data. It also needs larger network puzzles that train themselves on the given inputs and outputs, like the about a dozen visual neural modeling suites that are available. I would also like to see Transformer and Attention units since they are the new Few-Shot SOTA combination with upgraded basic logic."

It's also easy to use solutions from past puzzles as nodes in your current solution. - The game gives useful links to those interested in learning more about machine learning. Cons:- After a short time, the puzzles become very uninteresting. Most of them fall under the ""load balancing"" category, which means that you spend most of your time figuring out how to allocate output symbols to output streams to match the volume dictated by the puzzle. - The test run does not always terminate when the test is unsolvable, for example if all inputs have been sent to output streams, but the current accuracy and / or volume in the streams is not adequate. In these cases, if you want to see what went wrong, you will have to wait for the test to time out until you can view the stats for each output stream. This is annoying in combination with the prior point, when you are trying to debug which stream is getting too many nodes so that you can balance the output. - Most of the machine learning concepts introduced in the game end up being irrelevant to the puzzles. In particular, the reinforcement learning puzzles and RNN puzzles don't let you use the ideas to come up with clever solutions. The RL puzzles give you a lot of knobs to play with, but the puzzle doesn't require anything other than sending some inputs to the output stream. The RNN puzzles give you the idea of RNN, but don't allow you to connect the nodes in any interesting or meaningful way: each node has memory, but you are forbidden from doing anything with it other than feeding it back into the same node that produced it. Overall I don't recommend this game. The puzzles stop being interesting very early, and those that attempt to introduce more complicated machine learning topics avoid the hard task of introducing it in a way that the user can learn about the topic via the puzzles."

It saves previous levels' solutions for reuse but there's no way to save a new reusable component from what I can tell. Selection for copying/pasting often selects the wrong or adjacent nodes. Was fun when I just had to solve getting from input to output but became less fun as that stopped being the main goal.
619150,1,0,CrushaK,885,22,-1,10.8,"May 12, 2020","I want to like this game. But everywhere I look, I see nothing but wasted potential. It falls short both as a puzzle and as a programming game for several reasons:- It fails to properly communicate the rules that govern its mechanics. Do I *need* to use all outputs in a startup scenario? What happens if I just drop some inputs? Will it have repercussions?- Many puzzles are trivially easy and the program name in the bottom left corner often even gives away the exact pieces that you need to use.- Some of the mechanics feel outright broken or like cheating. You can basically improve the execution time of any program several times over by recreating it as ""DLL"", which is basically just another screen where you do the exact same thing as in the regular game screen. This trivializes any time-based optimization challenge of the puzzle, because apparently everything inside a DLL gets sent around instantly instead of following the usual rules of transmission delay that govern the rest of the game. I don't know any programming scenario where putting your instructions in another function and calling that will magically execute them several times faster than just writing them inline - this mechanic is completely counter-intuitive for any programmer.- It is completely unclear how you gain money from startups. If your program only offers capacity for 10% of your user base, that will actually net you a profit. Whereas extending your program with load balancers to accomodate more users will immediately set you off worse. Your best strategy actually seems to be to ignore pretty much all potential customers.- As you progress further in the game, you buy new ""hardware upgrades"" that make your programs execute faster. It seems like some puzzles are not even solvable with a gold medal until later in the game where you buy an upgrade and then simply re-run your previous solution in a puzzle.- The puzzles themselves don't seem particularly well designed. They all play pretty much the same, there is no variation that makes you feel like you need to adapt your strategies as the game progresses. This compares in no way to other programming games like 7 Billion Humans, where each level is a completely new creative challenge.- The educational aspect seems too little to actually teach you anything meaningful. It almost boils down to showing you something akin to Wikipedia excerpts from machine learning articles and saying ""if you want to learn more, read more on the internet - here's a link"". Some of these then contain very technical concepts in their description that make no sense to anyone who is not already a bit versed in machine learning.- Some mechanics are pretty pointless, like having a building block for ""gradient descent"" or the need to actually ""train"" your nodes. You basically put that block in your puzzle once to get another operation into a ""usable"" state, then delete it and never worry about it again. There is no challenge or problem-solving involved in that training step, it's merely flavor-stuff that you need to do before you can start with the actual challenge."

619150,226,5,bkendig,390,29,-1,7.1,"May 10, 2020","I spent seven hours getting to the end of this game, and I'm of mixed feelings about it.At its core, While True Learn is a puzzle game: given bins of input objects (red/green/blue circles/squares/triangles), move them to the output bins that want them (like, one bin might want red circles and blue squares). You do this by building a flowchart made of conditional blocks: a ""Decision Tree: Color"" can send one color to the top output and another color to the bottom output (the third color is sent randomly to either output), a ""SIFT"" sends one shape to the top and the other two shapes to the bottom, a ""MARK-1 Perceptron"" can divide the colors across its three outputs but requires training (and misidentifies some objects), and so forth. The challenge is to send the inputs to the correct outputs using a minimum of blocks and within a time limit, so you may have to spend some time optimizing your approach.At the same time, though this game is all about machine learning. ""Learn how machine learning really works!"" says the game's blurb, and the puzzle descriptions sound right up this alley. Predict a presidential election! Sniff out industrial espionage! Optimize roadway traffic! Write a chess bot! Recognize UFOs! The blocks you use all are named after real-world machine learning algorithms and have similar strengths/drawbacks. As you progress through the game and are introduced to new kinds of blocks, the game provides you with links to Wikipedia articles and YouTube videos explaining them and their history.Problem is ... none of that actually has any bearing on the puzzles, which are still only about moving red/green/blue circles/squares/triangles from input bins to output bins. Whether you're identifying viruses or writing a movie rating system, you wouldn't know it from the puzzles themselves, which all look the same. Some of the puzzles (even in later levels) are trivially simple; others are too complicated to be fun. The only puzzles that really stand out are the ones about teaching a car to drive by writing a solution for it and adding LIDAR to the front and sides, but these still confused me - the car would accelerate until it rear-ended someone and then it would tailgate that car until the test was up, at which point I'd usually get a passing grade because the car's average speed was above the requirement.On top of this are a strange array of features. You can buy hardware upgrades (after which simply re-running your earlier solutions can make them finish faster and get you more points), decorations for your office (the menu screen, which you don't spend much time on and you can only display a few decorations at a time anyway), and different kinds of cats (I didn't understand that at all). You can invest in startups, which means writing a solution for them and then clicking ""Next Day"" over and over again until the company stops making money. You can unlock ""DLLs,"" which appear to be a way to re-use your previous solutions (I never used these because it was easier to write each solution from scratch), and ""CatHub repos,"" which are just a notepad where you can try different approaches. There appears to be a well-developed ""secret code"" system where you can enter codes and unlock cosmetic items in the game.All in all, it's really uneven. This could have been a much more fun puzzle game if it had focused on the puzzles, or it could have been a much more educational game about machine learning if it had made the puzzles resemble real-world problems. (Think of Kerbal Space Program.) It's enjoyable, but I don't think it stands out. This game teaches machine learning as well as Civilization teaches politics - which is not at all; you only get to use the end results. There are better puzzle games out there, and there are better simulator games."

How does my car spend the whole time above the target speed and I get a gold medal?Why is there randomness in a game about programming? Here's a common situation.  The basic sorting node has two outputs and each can be set to output: red, green, blue, or anything. If you have the outputs set to red and green, then send blue through it, it outputs blue randomly. Sometimes this will work in your favor, but most of the time it doesn't. Some gold medal requirements are so stringent that you RELY on this mechanic.  If you go for gold medals, you will often find yourself removing and switching output paths, hoping you randomly get a good result. It might work, or you might end up one element short/your accuracy will be too low. Either way, you have no control at this point. (It's worth saying that you can eliminate randomness with enough nodes, but when going for gold and silver medals your maximum node count and time are limited.)Generally, this game is solid. Nice visuals, cute story, and the gameplay itself is fundamentally fine. Being a puzzle game, I would expect to use logic and intuition to progress. Not all puzzles here have randomness, and the ones that don't usually feel good to solve. However, it starts to feel really bad when chance is involved."
