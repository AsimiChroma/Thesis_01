Lacks complexity, it's trivial.Concept does not work on so many levels.I agree with other reviews.

I struggle to even call this a puzzle game when so many of the levels are putting a single piece in the middle of the boardI'm sad to say that past the first hour or two, you'll have seen everything of value in the game.I have very mixed feelings about this game.

This program did not familiarize me with programming, or make me feel more enthusiastic about programming.  Instead, it makes programming feel more daunting than it really is, and makes me feel like I'm not good enough."],["The good :+ Challenging, but not frustrating+ Filled with some interesting knowledge and history about Machine Learning+ Fun and enjoyable despite the bad and ugly+ CatsThe bad :- Extreme simplification and limitation to the point it can't be called Machine Learning\/Programming gameThe ugly :# Some puzzle could be solved in ridiculous way which only work on train\/test phase# Few puzzle need PC upgrades to earn silver\/gold ratingwhile True: learn() isn't good game, but it's not bad either.

The puzzles are negotiable with a little bit of thought and a hand full of trial and error.  It would be nice to get the option to an explanation of why the solutions ultimately worked. At one point you get to participate in a pizza business that eventually starts to lose money, with the instructions to bail out if profits start to suffer, but doesnt explain how to bail out of it!  Then after it tanks the game tells you that you should have pulled out of it earlier, but again,  it doesnt tell you how to get out of it. Most explanations of the logic functions are external links to web articles and youtube vids that are general in nature and are not applicable to the actual task you are working on.  Like explaining apples to work on oranges.  I like that the game gives you some some brief histories behind some of the functions and the logic that made them possible, that makes some of the puzzles a tad bit easier to grasp, but its still a lot of trial and error with nothing to explain why the solution was correct.  This is not a game that I will be playing much again, if at all.  The cat angle is cute, at first, hey i like pets, but it gets as goofy as the left leaning politics in some of the back stories the clients give you.  They are simply not needed and only shed a dim light on the game and devs.  I think this could have been a a little cooler game without it.  Unless you are already into logic programming, I would pass on this, or get in on 50% off sale like I did.","Frustrating when you don't get it. Rewarding when you finally do.","Great game !

Which is good, because I shudder to think about this being someone's introduction to programming.What made me quit after only ten minutes was the third or fourth level where you're forced to use a previous solution as part of your new solution. There are a couple of reasons this was a problem for me. First and foremost, it forces you into an inelegant and overly complicated solution for the problem given, and this in a game where you get rated for your performance. Secondly, the interface for including a previous solution gives no indication as to what is included in that block unless you edit it, which takes you back to the level for which that solution was created. In other words, you can't see your whole solution at once, even though it's an incredibly simple task with only a few nodes. Or if there is a way to, it was not intuitive nor clearly indicated.It's like this game wants to be a Zach-like, but completely missed the point on what makes them fun. Like optimization being a possibility and a challenge, and being able to solve puzzles in multiple ways.","Very good game :)","Good game. Easy access to information on the real world science being used and its origin, but it's also possible to avoid this and just use it as a puzzle game.would recommend at least paying minimum attention to what each one does, or there may be gaps appearing in what levels you can do.Hard-ish fun puzzle game."],["Fun game about programming, learning and with such a charming look as well!

Yes, the main line puzzles are not super hard, but the optional puzzles get tricky fast. This game is also more about statistics than programming. Not as hard as a Zachtronics game, but if you like those games and want a taste of something a little different, this should be right up your alley.","While you aren't going to come out of playing this game a machine learning developer, you will get a basic overview of various types of functions that are used in that field and play some fun puzzles along the way.","i don't feel like the programmer vibe at all","rawr","Very well made, fun, challenging game.  This game requires a unique way of thinking, different from the typical programmer's style of thinking.  I have a decent amount of programming experience in a few languages, yet this game can still be challenging or difficult without being frustrating.  I've learned a lot so far from it; the game includes lots of links to articles, videos, and other resources on real-world programming\/machine learning for those who want a deeper dive.  I'd highly recommend this game - especially to people who enjoy computer science\/programming and enjoyed games like Human Resources Machine and TIS.","An incredibly fun and engaging game for learning the basic principles of machine learning. Has a lot of attention on1. key ideas: perceptrons, parallel calculations, reinforcement learning etc. 2. practical applications: it shows a TON of different applications for ML and3. developer workflows: asking for questions on forums, keeping execution costs and time in mind etc.instead of being boring or focusing too much on the mathematical details :-)","Major bug remains unresolved after months.In particular, the game features a \"startup\" mechanic - you invest in the startup, write the \"program\" for what they need, and you reap money daily (minus server operating costs).  Unfortunately, startups have a bug preventing your solutions from functioning at the correct speed.  This means you will lose in game money, and real world time, as you struggle to fix a puzzle solution that may have nothing wrong with it.While this doesn't prevent you from enjoying most of the game, it isn't uncommon to encounter startup levels.And there is absolutely no notice that the levels do not function as intended, so until you get frustrated enough to google a solution, you will have no idea.","4.5 hrs into the game. So far very fun! I do find myself doing a lot of basic division in my head to optimize the builds and get the good results, and I sometimes wish the game had some sort of tool for some of this... Or just hints.A few more hours into the game, I really find myself wishing there was some rating system that might explain why the \"startups\" succeed or fail. I assume that how well they do is bound to how well you coded them, but the game never explicitly tells you this... I just know some of them continually make money and some of them crash and burn.With the normal levels there is a much more explicit explanation of why your constructed system is either good or bad; Accuracy of the results, run-time, number of nodes etc. With the startup-levels it is very difficult to know exactly if you're doing well or poorly, and why.","A fun little puzzle game that does a lot to teach about how machine learning works. Useful during boring meetings where nothing is getting accomplished anyway. Links to high quality articles and videos that teach concepts further. Would recommend for anyone interested in machine learning\/AI"],["This seems to be a reasonably good puzzle game with an AI theme.","Interesting take on a puzzle game. Amazing overall","A mostly facile experience of connecting black boxes that do things that mostly doesn't require understanding of the topic at hand.  I'm sympathetic - the scope of the topics being tackled exceeds what many programming games attempt to each but in the process it is oversimplified to the point of not really giving much understanding or accomplishment at all. The middle module got interesting?  At points even frustrating. The start and end were too easy.  Multiple levels in a row could be solved with the same rote solution at times.  The art and story concept are great.  The writing could use a little work but I found it mostly charming and fun, the grammar\/translation\/editing needs another pass.  The difficulty curve feels all over the place (it bears repeating).","Very good game.","A very good game to learn simple concept of Machine Learning and Data Science.It is real simple.

My favorite software right now.","","I tend to not have much patience for programming games, but this one has the perfect learning curve, I find myself getting enthralled and not bored!","Mostly plays and feels like a game of square pegs in square holes, as explained in another review.It feels like the devs had grand ideas about making a game about learning ML, but couldn't quite figure how to build interesting puzzles with those concepts.As a consequence, you basically manipulate the same blocks throughout the game. The puzzles are ok if you ignore the pretend ML backstory, although very stale after a while.Also, the difficulty curve is very weird, jumping from head-scratching to kindergarten level continuously. There are a couple challenging ones, I won't deny.","A little simplistic but overall a fun optimisation puzzle","I appreciate the effort that went into this game. There are plenty of online training games, but this one stands out for being engaging, and providing a layer of history that makes it more tangible for me. Thank you for the opportunity to play and learn.","while fun: play()","Very cool game about classification. One of the best programming puzzle games so far.I guess this is also well suited for non prgrammers.","Quite an enjoyable puzzle game for the price. The only criticism I have is that it can get a bit monotonous after a while as the game does tend to abstract all the problems down into sorting shapes and colours. Saying that, there is a reason AI specialists get paid a lot of money, and it is a necessary simplification of what is an extremely complex subject. For me, enjoyment of the game fell off significantly once it hit the last few problems and started dealing with RNNs and temporal prediction - to me this last section just seemed 'tacked on' and didn't really add anything other than perhaps a certain amount of confusion on what the actual aim was. Overall, a fun game with a few challenging problems. It won't turn you into a programmer or AI specialist, but it may introduce you to a different way of thinking about things.","This game is a bit slow on the uptake, but if you get past the tutorials there are some really good puzzles, especially if you want to go for gold medals.The interface is nice and smooth and the music is pleasant.A great way to learn about machine logic!"],["It is really relaxing and you learn more about learning logic.","really nice game, what amazed me is the fact that all the information used of the game has a direct link to the article of the theory of machine learning itself with some videos also, is really helpful to get the general idea","I just wanted to check it out but it turns out that it's really solid game.

Really interesting, contains links to real resources for learning data science","Started interesting but got worse the further I progressed. I finished the game in the 5h playtime, that's ok for what I've paid.I usually like programming games but this one isn't as fun as it could be.What I disliked:- Startup mechanics unclear. When the red user number got bigger I tried to parallelize the program but didn't affect the number at all. So I stated to skip the starup tasks. You don't really see how the written program affects the startup at all. - The rnn (at the end) is really boring. It's unclear how to connect the nodes (why do I have to connect themselves twice without any logic) and I really don't get what the desired output should be. If the node is trained it it will succeed. - The training of nodes in general seems broken: once trained it can be reused in later levels, why do I have to train them again when I use a new node? Training doesn't add anything to ge gameplay except it's boring to wait until the node is trained. If it is trained the gradient error thing can be removed. - I always had enough money to buy the additional nodes \/ upgrades. - I don't get what the cat skins and the entourage are used for. Seem to be visual only but cost money which should be better used for the upgrades so I never bought any.- one level doesn't have the trash bin so you have to back feed the unwanted items into the system again and stay there forever. Doesn't really make any sense.- some of the nodes are so slow that they aren't really used- you can't get gold for some level until later when you have bought upgrades- descriptions of nodes are wrong: for example the decision tree shape node is: \"This node compares socket's shapes with element's color (wrong, you can only select shapes). If an element's color (no colors! for this node) is equal to only one socket's color (sigh, not a color node), the elment modes to that socket. If an element's shape (oh now it's a shape node again?) satisfies both conditions, it moves to a random socket\". This is like beta or eraly access stuff which should be fixed a long time ago.All in all it seems unfinished. I had to check if it was an early access game but it's not. It would be ok for an EA game."],["Great intro to a variety of ML concepts and solutions with a bit of background and humour too!","Fun and educational!","Love it.

Best choice to consume short relax time.","Fine game. Worth its price.","Great art style, cool story line (but short), challenging at times, some superfluous trivial gameplay like improving perceptrons. Not recommended for anyone interested in the technicalities of machine learning.Specifics: [Reinforcement learning levels could be greatly improved as the sliders seem to barely vary outcome. \"Genes\" are shown nowhere, mutations are not described. Sequential models (end game) are the most trivial thing with no skill involved, this make you unlock a huge portion of the the end of the story without doing much work, making beating the game feel really unrewarding. Doing my best every time, the success of startups seemed entirely random, with all of them being successful, however some of them lasted months, others only a week. Copy paste mechanic was great though, much appreciated for bigger projects, however linking up multiple outputs at the same time is a feature I'd like to see]","I love this so much... the people and the support.. the learning, the puzzles, the humor, This has it all the everything. for every age.","good game if you are trying to make $150 an hour as a machine learning expert.","To me, the game feels hollow... The mechanics feels a bit backward...On the startup system, you get so little information and feel like you have so little control. It's not clear to me that there is anything to consider once you have something that seems to do the job, except for at one point adding a load balancer (but never more than 1!)... You will get a bunch of red users but adding more balancer will just make things cost you more...I keep feeling that it's the same puzzle over and over again, look at that, i need to split in 3 colors and then do some split according to shapes! How completely unlike the previous 4 startups(sarcasm)! How do i split in 3 colors, of course I use 3 decision tree. Sometimes it's a little bit varied, but the same patterns come over and over again...The whole processing cost of things makes no sense. If you have a chain of 50 components, they all do work at the same time, yet the processing time is the same as having a single component... But if you decide to have a load balancer, then the cost just doubles... And if you add another one, it doubles again? So you quadrupled your cost to at most triple your output. That's just not how anything works, and makes everything feels somewhat contrived.At one point, some puzzle are about literally like tricking your stats to get what you want... You could have 100% accuracy in both outputs, but then that means one of them doesn't get enough results (because there isn't enough data for it), so lets just make my setup literally more complicated to mix some results and have lower accuracy in one of the box, but get enough entries. That makes no sense unless you are trying to cheat your customer.And when you get to the point where you just add nodes randomly and change lines because you need to get some more then nodes at X row, just because the game wants at least X nodes there... It just feels like the goals the game evaluates you on are not thematic, and the game won't really help you deal with those goal.I wanted to like that game, I play many programming-like game but that one just doesn't click.To clarify that I gave the game a chance, I got up to the genetic algorithm with gold everywhere (and every side task).","I'm still going through, but enjoying it so far.","Very benefitial game if u want to enhance your logic skills","I have played very few games that make learning satisfying and even fun.

A lot of times you will end up in a state where you sorted shapes and colors correctly, but you have 15\/16 greens in top one and 17\/16 greens in bottom one.Getting back to previous levels to get more stars can often mean using same solution with just upgraded hardware.","The most interesting things in this world are, at their roots, quite complex. The average human mind resists complexity, finding the things which are simple and intuitive most comforting. Games like this allow a person to make complex things more intuitive, so that they can see beauty in them. It's really hard to do that unless you can make the required repetitions fun. This game has accomplished that. If more people can gain an intuitive understanding of complex systems, it is probable that fewer will be intimidated by the subject.

Music is great, puzzles are interesting. And cats!","Best game about cat and machine learning ever","Very interesting idea and also fun in the beginning but soon gets repetetive, boring and pretty annoying. Quite often the solution of a task doesn't involve logic but simply trial and error. It might be just me but I never quite understood why certain solutions didn't work whereas others did. Consequently, I failed to identify and understand the logic behind the game, even though I would not classify myself as a programming noob. If you are looking for a puzzle game and love to try every possible combination only to find the one that does the trick even though this solution might  be unexpected: go for it. If you are looking for a game, however, that is solely based on logic and allows to solve tasks directly in the first try once you know what you do: don't bother to by WTL.EDIT: after additional 7 hours of playing I finally got so annoyed that I uninstalled WTL in total frustration and anger. Regret to say that WTL is a pure waste of time and money after all. What this game lacks the most is a proper manual! Best example: how am I supposed to run any of the startups if I don't know what's really driving their profit?! I would expect that backload should have a major impact, but to my experience that was only minor. Sometimes very simple layouts generate profit but sometimes they just don't. Too often it's just trial and error, see if a layout works and if not reload an earlier savegame, with no real hunch of what the solution should ideally look like. And then there is this stupid gameplay. Best example: that annoying training thing you can do on nodes. What's that supposed to do after all?! I mean, it's just bloody annoying because most of the time you drag a node on the layout (catout or whatever stupid name it was given in the game) just to press training over and over again to get its accuracy finally down to 20% anyhow. That's just so pointless! Not to mention that incomprehensible learning algorithm for that self-driving car task for which you can adjust parameters such as population and percentage but you just don't know that their impact is.I understand that the game is supposed to teach something about machine learning. I can hardly see how that's achieved here. All you do is drag nodes and connect them, sometimes with intermediate steps. That's what I would call puzzle-solving but not machine-learning. This game is definitely overrated and not worth the money.","Very nice, fun puzzle game.","A game about machine learning that largely lacks actual machine learning......plus you get to support dictatorships in their oppression of their people, and lend a hand in corporate theft as part of the gameplay?-.-That fell very flat with me.  A game presenting scenarios with oppression and straight up commission of crime as cheerful programming tasks.I only got so far, some of the puzzles seemed repetitive, others seemed like unintended blackbelt level challenges where the challenge wasn't in the problem as stated, but rather using a finite set of instructions to do a task they are not suited for, under constraints that would make it difficult with the proper tools (which you lack).  As a programmer, I've never seen a programming task as inept as that.   Gameplay, for as far as I got?  Mostly ok, though it looked like it might get repetitive, or force you to do tasks while lacking the proper tools for the task.  \"Put widgets 8 into bin 1, 12 into bin 2, 30 into bin 3...  using tools that are ignorant of math....\"Educational content: Low\/mid.  The actual gameplay itself was sparse on educational content.  It used words that meant things, and explained what those things did, but the gameplay itself avoided the detail of how those things did anything that they did.Game morals\/ethics: Toxic.  It broaches the topics of politics and ethics in ways that I strongly prefer to avoid in anything of even a quasi-educational nature that is not itself classed around politics or ethics.  This game is trying to present itself as a puzzle\/programming related game (ie, neither politics nor ethics).

IMO very bad design choice to incorporate progression elements in a puzzle game.","Its nice and relaxing along with some parts that are challenging.","game cool cat good","I cannot recommend this to the casual puzzle player. I personally found it frustrating, unhelpful and made me feel stupid. - The difficulty curve is all over the place. The central path is sometimes so routine as to plop one thing down, hook it up and press play. While others are so stringent on their gold criteria as to seem impossible.- I often didn't know why my solution wasn't working to reach gold. The feedback from the game is terrible. There is a lot one has to infer that isn't called out: ratios, order, accuracy and efficiency are either not talked about, or talked about in a separate window without context. Sure, one learns these things over time, but they are hard to truly understand. Which makes succeeding and failing very close to one another.- Then you try to learn by watching a youtube vid, or read the forums, and the difference from the solution that made sense to me and what makes gold, is so minor as to be opaque to be understood. It's a shame because they're trying to teach something, and I'm just not learning - even by copying.- There is no guidance in the startup missions other than a single tutorial message right at the start of your first one. I often didn't know whether to patch, why to patch, if people were unhappy due to the speed of my process, or the cost, or just the end of the cycle. Some start ups I made a killing, others I immediately lost money from day one... even though it sure seemed everything was working as efficiently as I could make it. A little prompt on the first few to tell me why users are leaving, or what I could do in a patch to help turn it around would have been really helpful as there are dozens of ways to solve these challenges.- Repetitive sameness in the challenges despite mission fluff text. Obviously there are only so many ways I want to sort 3 shapes and 3 colours. 4 hours in was my fill. You're essentially filtering. That's all you do: Filter inputs of colour and or shape. You build up widgets that have rules to how they filter, and time and time again you'll find yourself  separating one colour from the next, one shape from another. They add a couple wrinkles, time of widget's filter and accuracy of output... and if there is more I apologise, but I didn't have the patience to wade through the sameness to reach that newness.- Game doesn't provide moments to use what you learn. You can make snippets somehow and use them in other missions... but you cannot edit them. I don't know when I can make those snippets. There is a DLL tab which is also a thing you can make on the side and bring in. Why would I? Don't know. The game's store (all in game currency) wants me to buy another DLL tab. Why? I don't know why I should bother with the first one.Now, perhaps you're super smart. Already a developer. Can understand their intent simply by what they have called things. In which case, this may be your bag. However, if  you're just regularly smart. Felt the game loop of 7 Billion Humans was good and fair, and liked to feel empowered as you learned ever more complex things and made your way up each floor. Wouldn't mind a little bit of hand holding when you need it (and in-game thanks... I don't want to interrupt my play session by not playing and reading forum posts or watching other people play on youtube) . Then this may be more frustrating than enjoyable.","As disappointing as learning what machine learning is really about.If you're a developer looking for something that challenges your algorithm designing skills, this ain't it.If you're not a developer but interested in learning what machine learning is about, this ain't it.This is just a logic puzzle game disguised as \"visual programming\" with a narrative loosely (and inaccurately) following the history of AI.Remember those \"edutainment\" games from the 90s? Mediocre and uninventive puzzle games that tried to feed you unrelated knowledge between levels? This is exactly like those.","To be honest I'm kind of disappointed with the game. At the very least it was on sale (It's worth maybe $5, nothing more).While the idea behind it is very interesting (using machine learning to solve puzzles) the execution is sloppy and leaves a lot to be desired. Almost all of the levels are based on putting coloured shapes into right holes, only the way you do it differs (think very simple SpaceChem). At the beginning of the game you can only use slow, primitive nodes to filter shapes and colours. Early levels are very easy and require little to no thinking. The game peaks at the middle of the story and then it goes downhill; fast. You don't get much more nodes than those that were available from the start (and you can only use ones that the devs allowed). Eventually you are introduced to nodes that are supposed to represnt real-life machine learning algorithms like genetic algorithm or neural networks, but they are actually pretty much the same filtering nodes that you already have but with added error (the outputs also have an error margin). You will also have to train them just like in real life except it's literally nothing more than a filler. You can connect everything however you want, press \"train\" wait a couple of seconds and copy\/paste the trained node. I don't see any point in that other than being a filler. The last few levels try to add some more machine-learning related mechanics but they also fail miserably. You, again, have to do some filler moves (connecting the node to itself to imitate how it works in real life, and god forbids you forget about it), wait for it to train, copy\/paste and add a filter node to direct coloured shapes into right holes. There are also few levels that introduce reinforcement learning but it's also limited to doing some thoughtless moves, changing a few sliders, playing a minigame and waiting for it to \"evolve\". There are many animated elements on the screen so that it looks like a lot is happening but in reality nothing is.The startup mechanic (another way to make some money) is also very confusing. On one hand it looks like those should be extra-hard levels that you will be gratuitously rewarded for but on the other you can just brute-force them, copy\/paste the solution so it works faster and forget about it until it doesn't make profit anymore. You can also spend your money on cat skins, visual upgrades and four different node upgrades, two of which are useless if you think about it. (Data transfer speed and queue size won't solve bottlenecks).The devs also attempt to teach you how machine learning algorithms work but unless you already know them their explanations won't be of any use.Only side quests are worth doing as some of them actually require you to think about it but other than that you can finish the whole game by trial and error.All in all I cannot recommend this game unless it's on a big sale (less than $5).","Very playable while you can also learn.you get to know basic concepts of machine learning but does not go deep.( in my 2 hrs experience)","A fun puzzle-type game about computers and AI.

I usually enjoy these kinds of logic\/coding puzzle games, but unfortunately was a bit frustrated by this one.  CPU time consumed by your \"code\" is one of the level passing criteria, but it wasn't clear to me how the seconds left on the clock mapped to blocks in my code diagram.  For example, on \"Toy manufacturing\" task the simplest maximally parallel solution does not beat the clock, but some arbitrary other graph with with more blocks in series does.  Huh?  I also think the claim of \"learn how machine learning really works\" is an overstatement.  There are links to external videos and materials that teach the real deal, but you won't learn that by playing the game, which is only loosely inspired by machine learning.

It excels at that. It reminds me of games such as 7 Billion Humans or the Human Resource Machine but it's a bit different as it focuses less on the actual code itself and more about processing the information and mixing pre existing code blocks.Nice challenging difficulty. The simple story about the cat and the simulated work environment with dev forums, hardware upgrades, etc., add charm and cut the monotony and abstractedness. The interface is simple and easy to use and fit in with the general mood of the game.

The game is less programming and more similar to the boring parts of being a network admin. You're just doing load balancing.  A puzzle will want you to get 20% of the blocks into bin A, 30% into bin B, and 50% into bin C, and you have to arrange your splitters in such a way that the proportions come out right. When you get a \"learning\" node, it's just a splitter that makes errors, and to lower the error you have to run data through it. It doesn't need any particular data, or feedback, or to be arranged with other learning nodes in any way, you can literally just run random data through it and dump the data into nowhere and its error rate goes down.  This is neither entertaining or educational.There's also a mechanic for \"upgrading your hardware\" that really doesn't work well in the context of this kind of game.  Grinding for better gear is okay in an RPG, but in a logical puzzle game where you're trying to find the exact optimal solution, you can be banging your head up against a wall trying to figure out why your solution isn't working and it turns out you got it right you just have to go upgrade your processor.  Imagine playing portal and you're trying all kinds of angles and ideas to get up on some ledge, then it turns out you just have to go grind previous levels and buy 5 more jump upgrades so you can just jump up there, and that's the only way to beat it, and for the whole game there is no way to know if you're failing to think of something clever or you just need to muscle through it by buying more stuff.","Count yourself as a machine learning engineer, not a useless moron ^^","A good programming puzzle where new mechanics are explained both using real world lingo and gameplay.","Informative game for those curious about machine learning \/ so called AI, plus the design is cute!"],["Fun at the beginning, but drops off near the end.

The visuals are nice and engaing, the cat theme is funny and interesting, but as a game it just does not work for me.First of all, the premise of learning more about ML and AI is unfulfilled for me. Yes, there are cards and links to explanations, but the game itself does not in any way explore or try to explain ML and is just a generic puzzle game with ML themes and names.If the puzzle aspect of the game was well done, I could turn a blind eye on the educational aspect - but even the puzzle game is not very well executed. There are a couple well designed head scratching levels, but most levels are either too obvious and easy or too random.Even the special levels (AI-driven car and startups) turn out to not be so fun - the car puzzles are just too random without any obvious input you can provide in and the startups are bugged, so after a certain point you cannot improve on them (and this bug has been in the game for at least a year and still isn't fixed).As much as I wanted to liked this game, I just can't recommend it - neither as a puzzle game nor as an intro to the wonderful world of Machine Learning.","very good.","Nice puzzle game, with some interesting articles about machine learning.","the best game for coder","Fun puzzle game","really good game lol","A really great game, simplistic systems complex enough to spend hours on this game without noticing and a lot of cats!"],["I know nothing about coding, and this game is still a blast.

It's silly, it's cute, it's fun.But ultimately I felt it wasn't that satisfying. There wasn't a lot of programming involved; levels felt repetitive, and also shallow. I was disappointed as I got to the end of the game because it felt like a lot of the levels were just \"plop down these few pieces, and you're good\". The cat theme was cute but I don't feel it had much to do with the actual game. I encountered a soft-lock bug that made me need to shut the game down from the task manager (I think I was pasting a dll in that had other dlls in it). The game experienced slowdown on some levels even though it's only displaying 2D circles and squares and triangles. I never clicked on the links for resources in learning about real-life programming, because I wanted to play the game instead. They might be useful.Again, I'm not saying 'stay away'. If it really strikes your fancy, like it did mine, give it a shot. I don't regret getting it, I had a bit of fun, and I'll probably go back in to try some of the side-missions again that I haven't completed.

If the usage of the term \"purr-fect\" instead of perfect is clever to you, this game would probably suit you.It's basically a simple module based sorting game, which allows (forces) you to use different modules as you continue. The puzzles they put together were decent enough, some of which required you to really break down the count of the sorted objects then balance them into their final spots.

Developers are very responsive (found an audio bug).Now, I need to find a way to make my gf play it.","As a programmer this game piqued my interest when I saw it. I have to say some of the puzzles are quite hard and not in a bad way. It is really hard to find a puzzle game that can truly challenge and teach me at the same time. Overall, the aesthetics are very nice. Everything is very clean, well organzied. The music is motivating and doesn't get old after playing it for a while.

The fact that it inclines on being educational is endaring too. Despite the natural complexity that comes with understanding algorithms, the game manages to guide the player throught each level in a simple way. I believe it will hook a good amount of players into the world of AI and programming. It is also not too hard when playing the main story, but at the same time it presents you with optional, quite complex challenges.","is fun","I've tried Machine Learning with Orange, now I have with Cats.

It's more like teaching you the logic needed to design algorithms.","This game is a great puzzle game dealing with unique mechanics that help learn about machine learning! But I think it could be better in a couple ways. Sometimes if you get stuck there doesnt seem to be a lot of help besides videos on the mechanics of a principal which dont seem to help teach the practical uses of it in the real world and along with puzzle solving in the game. Another thing being that if you're testing something for a task, if your time exceeds that time limit for a bronze ranking then it automatically ends the test, but it could be very helpful to let the simulation run its course to learn more about how structures and certain node combinations work!","Great game for people who love challenges.","It's cute, it's easy to learn, and it will pique your curiosity about machine learning!A definite purchase if you're into programming, or puzzles in general","Great way to boost your logical thinking!","This game is one of the cutest games that teaches people about ML and thinking like a programmer.

Except some extra tasks are so hard that I can't  get golden.","I found the game fun and as a game I would say it is a success. The price range on it is reasonable. One of the few negatives people have written of is that it isn't very educational. It is however, I would argue more educational than most games.  If you're looking for something purely educational I would recommend reading a programming book, buying a RaspBerry Pi, or  better yet going to one of the many programming websites with free tutorials.

Main \"story\" tasks are quite straightforward while optional side tasks can be considerably more challenging to get the best outcome. Interface is sleek & intuitive. Excellent balance in introducing and explaining real design concepts without distracting from the flow of the game","I want to like this game. But everywhere I look, I see nothing but wasted potential. It falls short both as a puzzle and as a programming game for several reasons:- It fails to properly communicate the rules that govern its mechanics. Do I *need* to use all outputs in a startup scenario? What happens if I just drop some inputs? Will it have repercussions?- Many puzzles are trivially easy and the program name in the bottom left corner often even gives away the exact pieces that you need to use.- Some of the mechanics feel outright broken or like cheating. You can basically improve the execution time of any program several times over by recreating it as \"DLL\", which is basically just another screen where you do the exact same thing as in the regular game screen. This trivializes any time-based optimization challenge of the puzzle, because apparently everything inside a DLL gets sent around instantly instead of following the usual rules of transmission delay that govern the rest of the game. I don't know any programming scenario where putting your instructions in another function and calling that will magically execute them several times faster than just writing them inline - this mechanic is completely counter-intuitive for any programmer.- It is completely unclear how you gain money from startups. If your program only offers capacity for 10% of your user base, that will actually net you a profit. Whereas extending your program with load balancers to accomodate more users will immediately set you off worse. Your best strategy actually seems to be to ignore pretty much all potential customers.- As you progress further in the game, you buy new \"hardware upgrades\" that make your programs execute faster. It seems like some puzzles are not even solvable with a gold medal until later in the game where you buy an upgrade and then simply re-run your previous solution in a puzzle.- The puzzles themselves don't seem particularly well designed. They all play pretty much the same, there is no variation that makes you feel like you need to adapt your strategies as the game progresses. This compares in no way to other programming games like 7 Billion Humans, where each level is a completely new creative challenge.- The educational aspect seems too little to actually teach you anything meaningful. It almost boils down to showing you something akin to Wikipedia excerpts from machine learning articles and saying \"if you want to learn more, read more on the internet - here's a link\". Some of these then contain very technical concepts in their description that make no sense to anyone who is not already a bit versed in machine learning.- Some mechanics are pretty pointless, like having a building block for \"gradient descent\" or the need to actually \"train\" your nodes. You basically put that block in your puzzle once to get another operation into a \"usable\" state, then delete it and never worry about it again. There is no challenge or problem-solving involved in that training step, it's merely flavor-stuff that you need to do before you can start with the actual challenge.","cool","It's a perfect puzzle game.","Great concept but little instruction telling you what you actually need to do to pass a level as you progress. It saves previous levels' solutions for reuse but there's no way to save a new reusable component from what I can tell. Selection for copying\/pasting often selects the wrong or adjacent nodes. Was fun when I just had to solve getting from input to output but became less fun as that stopped being the main goal.","Great concept, great execution.  A very cool puzzle game based on an intuitive set of real-world problem-solving skills (derived from machine learning expertise, but applicable for a wider variety of solution-focused logical frameworks).   Good challenges that encourage  a great trial-and-error approach while you learn the principle behind the solution.  Fun and funny.The amazing thing is that this game makes me want to get started with machine learning, despite how insanely busy I am with work these days.  Every time I pass a board, I'm tempted (again and again) to use some of the links provided to get started with ML (the game does a good job of giving fictional-names-but-real-world reasons for solving each puzzle.  Then I remember I'm everything I have to get done before tomorrow. Such a strange juxtaposition of 'avoid beginning to study a completely new field' and 'just-one-more-board' while I should be preparing for my classes.  A fully optimized 10 out of 10.  Awesome game. AVOID IT it like crazy if you have actual work to do.","Found it to be interesting and surprisingly fun and relaxing, i'm not someone who knows much about coding or machine learning but was fun and interesting to test it out.","meow","It's a decent introduction to logic for programming and the basic advances in programming over the decades.  The blocks and routing feel more like networking.  I'd recommend to people who like puzzles.The cat-heavy theme wears after a while but isn't too overpowering overall.  There number of levels feel about right, and some of them are quite challenging.  The gold, silver and bronze levels mean that you don't have to get everything optimised to move forward which was helpful.","Good and fun game to play!","It functions as a very decent intro to data science in general.  I'd say it appeals to a wider audience and is more accessible than e.g. some Zachtronics games. I could see it being very helpful to younger players.With 20 years of programming experience I was able to complete my first play through of this game in about 5 hours. I think it was a good value for what I paid.","Interesting way to learn some basic knowledge of data processing..Extra learning materials provided :D","A simple logical game.  This is as game for those of us who cannot turn off our minds, even while relaxing.  The best thing about this game is that it has accommodated the concepts of programming to my background in psychology and has made me rethink the complexity of programming.  With the concepts in mind, all I need is the specifics of the language itself.  The program is a reflection of the thinker.","I spent seven hours getting to the end of this game, and I'm of mixed feelings about it.At its core, While True Learn is a puzzle game: given bins of input objects (red\/green\/blue circles\/squares\/triangles), move them to the output bins that want them (like, one bin might want red circles and blue squares). You do this by building a flowchart made of conditional blocks: a \"Decision Tree: Color\" can send one color to the top output and another color to the bottom output (the third color is sent randomly to either output), a \"SIFT\" sends one shape to the top and the other two shapes to the bottom, a \"MARK-1 Perceptron\" can divide the colors across its three outputs but requires training (and misidentifies some objects), and so forth. The challenge is to send the inputs to the correct outputs using a minimum of blocks and within a time limit, so you may have to spend some time optimizing your approach.At the same time, though this game is all about machine learning. \"Learn how machine learning really works!\" says the game's blurb, and the puzzle descriptions sound right up this alley. Predict a presidential election! Sniff out industrial espionage! Optimize roadway traffic! Write a chess bot! Recognize UFOs! The blocks you use all are named after real-world machine learning algorithms and have similar strengths\/drawbacks. As you progress through the game and are introduced to new kinds of blocks, the game provides you with links to Wikipedia articles and YouTube videos explaining them and their history.Problem is ... none of that actually has any bearing on the puzzles, which are still only about moving red\/green\/blue circles\/squares\/triangles from input bins to output bins. Whether you're identifying viruses or writing a movie rating system, you wouldn't know it from the puzzles themselves, which all look the same. Some of the puzzles (even in later levels) are trivially simple; others are too complicated to be fun. The only puzzles that really stand out are the ones about teaching a car to drive by writing a solution for it and adding LIDAR to the front and sides, but these still confused me - the car would accelerate until it rear-ended someone and then it would tailgate that car until the test was up, at which point I'd usually get a passing grade because the car's average speed was above the requirement.On top of this are a strange array of features. You can buy hardware upgrades (after which simply re-running your earlier solutions can make them finish faster and get you more points), decorations for your office (the menu screen, which you don't spend much time on and you can only display a few decorations at a time anyway), and different kinds of cats (I didn't understand that at all). You can invest in startups, which means writing a solution for them and then clicking \"Next Day\" over and over again until the company stops making money. You can unlock \"DLLs,\" which appear to be a way to re-use your previous solutions (I never used these because it was easier to write each solution from scratch), and \"CatHub repos,\" which are just a notepad where you can try different approaches. There appears to be a well-developed \"secret code\" system where you can enter codes and unlock cosmetic items in the game.All in all, it's really uneven. This could have been a much more fun puzzle game if it had focused on the puzzles, or it could have been a much more educational game about machine learning if it had made the puzzles resemble real-world problems. (Think of Kerbal Space Program.) It's enjoyable, but I don't think it stands out. This game teaches machine learning as well as Civilization teaches politics - which is not at all; you only get to use the end results. There are better puzzle games out there, and there are better simulator games.","While rather short, this does open up the basic concepts of machine learning to laymen folk like myself.  I enjoyed my 6 hours, worth the  sale price I paid for the game :)","Been playing for 2 hours and I've fallen in love with the game!","Cool","My cat absolutely love this game, but he is definetly more skillfull dev :(.

Some of the end game mechanics rely on trying to introduce real world machine learning concepts that just don't translate well to a video game at all. There's probably about 10 hours of gameplay total here, and some of that is spent doing repetitive clicks \"training\" your models. The first half is great, second half feels like a chore. I actually went back and tried to better my scores on lower levels because it was much better than any endgame content. This game could get a new lease of life simply by allowing some sort of user created content where users could create and share puzzles.

A must try game","Not usually into these types of games but this is fun and I actually feel my time is being spent worthwhile. Music is very relaxing and the articles\/history inserts are very informative.","The puzzles further in are really frustrating, as you need to play around with the probabilities to get the gold medal. The data sources often include uneven data sets, which is fine, but often you have no idea how the data will actually flow out until you have done some prototyping, and actually seeing the order. This is really bad as the order can break or make your solution, and more often than not you need to dance around some surprise bottle-neck introduced by sudden surge of blue squares, or drought of acceptable values introduced as the red triangles you were sorely counting on for that gold time are at the back of the data flow. It really does not help that some blocks, such as SIFT, introduce more random to the equation, making it really hard to predict how your solution will fare. Sometimes you still end up with pretty good solution, but then have no idea how you could possibly optimize it further to get that one second off required for gold medal. The blind trial and error required by the game is disgusting.The UI is horrible. The input and output blocks are locked to sides of the screen, which limits the amount of space you have for your solution by a ton. You are able to zoom out, but that only makes the inserted blocks smaller, and the text in blocks becomes unreadable really fast. If you zoom back in to read the text, the blocks grow in size and the lines become a huge mess. The line management is awful, and there no way to avoid criss-crossing the lines. It would be really big help if you could make some nice wedges to the paths, or reorder the outputs, especially in SIFT blocks.I liked the tidbits on machine learning, but I don't really feel like I'm any closer to grasping machine-learning than before starting the game. The story seemed kind of fun, but is very bare-bones. The store and the start-up business thingy felt really out-of-place, and I would have really liked if the devs would have rather concentrated on how to make the UI and the puzzles less frustrating. There was lot of potential about the game, but as things stand I would not recommend this to anyone. There are a lot of better puzzle games around, and those interested about machine-learning are surely better off learning about it from elsewhere.","Pretty cool.

Personally, I could be into that, but I don't know what sort of math this is. If it's purely algebra, then I'm not familiar with how to solve this type of problem. Comments appreciated.","Good and fun puzzle game.","I like it.","Great game so far!","Really fun puzzle game with lots of information about machine learning.  It could be slightly clearer\/more polished in places (such as what the success criteria are, and how to improve) but generally it's a joy to experiment with and the link to real world examples is quite unique and fascinating.","Pretty fun game if you don't mind getting angry at programming not working the way you want.","What on earth is a peceptron?

If you do like them, maybe you'd like a challenge and this type of sorting and weighting strikes your  fancy.I own this game since early access and used to be on the fence with the label \"machine learning\"  because sorting colorful shapes is not machine learning per se. But a working solution often depends on accuracy and weighting (how much from what goes in which \"pot\") to actually work and then it starts to get clear, how the aforementioned machine learning is actually true.And especially the weighting part can get tricky - how many shapes and colors do you have, how many of a specific color and or shape do you need to sort? Do you test for color before or after that? And how to divide the load until every target gets the right amount? Even then you might realize that your solution is too slow and everything can be done differently.Is that game now for you? Good question. I'd say watch a let's play and decide then  this way you get an idea what to expect and how it's meant to be played.I DO like the game and give it a thumbs up.","Meow Meow~","This was not what I was hoping for. - The writing in English feels like it could have used some polish, as it feels unnatural and at times confusing. - I'm comparing the game to Puzzle Agent 2 and their puzzle interface, where you can get hints, rules for the puzzles and a \"how?\" explanation of the puzzles after solving them. This game could have benefited a lot from having at least one of these features. - The story seemed pretty cute at first, but as a total beginner to code it was hard for me to tell what was a joke or pop culture reference and what was legitimate facts about machine learning and coding.","This game was recommended to me by a fellow programmer, and my kids and I really enjoy playing it.","Very fun.

Actually learn about data science using node-based visual programming!and cats!!!","A game that's actually teaching me real world skills and a little bit a history? That's crazy.","This was a tough decision.  On one hand, the opening hour or so of the game was awesome - creativity, humor, and an actual story are rare in games like these, but they clearly tried, and it shows with a very polished first hour.Of course, obviously, things went downhill after that.  Part of what interested me in this game was that it looked like there were lots of minigames and other things, like the self-driving car shown in the videos.  Turns out, the car minigame is the only minigame there is.  Not only that, but it's very broken\/buggy; the 'requirements' for your car are just that it needs to drive at a certain speed (and for the first 5\/6 of the car missions, that target speed is the same speed the car starts at), so for all but the last one they just accepted it immediately without ever having to 'evolve' the model.  Which is weird, because they wrote custom systems just for these 6 or so car missions, and then the first 5 of them don't actually require you to do anything with them.And then they kinda stopped adding new mechanics or doing anything interesting towards the end of the game - every 'puzzle' feels like someone just randomized which colors\/shapes you need to output, and I stopped reading the descriptions long before the end because they're pretty much totally unrelated to the puzzle.  And even when you do get new mechanics toward lategame, they're just new ways to do the same things you've been doing but a little fasterMostly, it feels like they put a lot of effort into hooking a new player, and then just kinda threw the rest of the game togetherAnyway other than those gripes, it was mostly a pretty fun game.  I liked how you could get upgrades to your PC which would give you small, 1%-5% bonuses to things (which really didn't matter in the end but was still a good distraction from the endless samey puzzles), the start-ups were a neat idea, and I liked the medal system vs the Zachtronics style of 'optimize one of these three parameters'.  If you really like these kinds of games, this one's unique as far as they go, but otherwise I wouldn't recommend it."],["Plays like an enjoyable puzzle game while teaching important machine learning concepts.","Very nice puzzle game based on something I've been wanting to learn more about for awhile.","Cats...","I would recommend it to everyone to have a good time at the game, but at some point, it would be better to improve itself, for example, different types of tasks can be created.

However, if you are looking for a really fun puzzle game based around programming principles or just a really fun puzzle game, then this is the game for you!The idea behind this game is that the player is given some basic tools to solve problems and that these tools are based on components and ideas that are used in programming and form the basis for Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. The game contains a lot of useful information and links to places where you can learn more about programming and A.I., but playing the game wont teach you how to program or teach you Machine Learning Algorithms.I love this game! You can make a solution as simple or complicated as you want with some puzzles being highly replayble.In fact, the reason why I have spent so much time playing this game is due to the puzzles called \"Startups\". A startup is a company which you help by creating the algorithm to solve their business problem. There are a lot of different ways to solve them and yes there are 'best' ways, but then there are absolutely insane ways to solve them which are better than the best.As either an educational start point or as an enjoyable puzzle game, this game is well worth buying.","So satisfying when the penny drops and you figure out the perfect system.

I've been trying several educational CS games and this one has great potential. They do a great job with the feel and style of the game. I like how they use a real world problem approach to the puzzles and that they give you rewards for solving them. But those rewards should be aesthetic and not required to add marginal upgrades.  I have several questions; Why is the game 'grindy'? Why are not all puzzles solvable with the tools given? Making the user obtain marginal upgrades to go back and solve past puzzles. Why are some higher level puzzles reliant on RNG? (I understand real world heuristic applications, but this will push away novices and students, and that is not what we want as a field.) It seems that these measures were put into place to add replayability, but will add frustration to the novice user.If you are looking to getting into Computer Science and Coding\/Programming there are several games here on Steam that are great as well as other free and paid resources online.","A very fun, and often challenging, game for those wanting to understand Machine Learning.

Love it.","I'm a computer programmer and wanted to check out some of these \"learn to code\" games. This isn't one of those.This game doesn't use \"if-then-else\" loops or lines of code. Instead, it encapsulates these programming building blocks into \"nodes\" that you then string together to come up with a desired outcome. It's a great approach to it, and they make it fun by tying in real-world applications (albeit much simplified, of course).You're not going to start the next AAA game after completing this one, but it's a good way to start thinking logically about information processing.","This game is a logic puzzle game, an amazing one. It gives you an overview of the world of AI\/Machine Learning in a fun and interactive way. Beware of Cat Jokes and Humorous fun. Good for anyone interested in AI\/ML. Overall well made and fun. 10\/10","I think this is the first game on Steam that I don't recommend. Just following the main story, in less than an hour, at certain point you have to train an 'AI' to drive a car, and it's just a broken mess. It pops some arcade mechanics out of nowhere, that just feels buggy, but one cant tell if its the game or oneself missing something. Finally I gave up and went to check several YT gameplays, and confirmed the broken state. I'm afraid this game misses something, either poor communication of some hidden non explored mechanics, or just publishing without knowing about it. Maybe Dev just tried to over simplify it too much, and didn't use fresh and competent beta testers to point out the flaws and user experience. Maybe Dev did, but didn't listen? Just makes me sad. I just asked for a refund. -- Please note: Maybe as you read this, the game has been fixed? But, how does one know without paying first?","Left me scratching my head - and not in a good way.It's difficult to review, let alone compare, systems-engineering games. Most Zachtronics games can run well into the double- or triple-digits, and this game inhabits a similar genre. That said, even a mere ~7.5 hours into this game, I'm baffled by the design choices that were made for the gameplay. Here's just a few reasons why:  The difficulty curve is a nightmarish rollercoaster. Some of the most finicky levels I encountered were followed by single-step puzzles with a solution I'd previously learned. You're given tools that - so far, in my playthrough - you're very rarely incentivized to use, because they will always be far slower than the simpler functions. Lore-wise, you're given cutesy flavor text about programming self-driving cars for sentient cats in one level, then Orwellian descriptions of political imprisonment in the next. It's all over the place. No matter the data you're sorting in-universe, though, 99% of the time it shows up on the UI as red, green, and blue shapes - so why even bother? Why are performance upgrades even a thing? It raises doubts about whether gold medals can be earned on the first playthrough of the level with clever building, or whether the only choice is to return after upgrading. If performance upgrades ARE a thing, why also tie exorbitant amounts of money for cutesy decorative tat? Why are startups essentially \"golden parachute simulator?\" It isn't fulfilling to try to make perfect code the first time, discover the company is failing anyway, then try to bail before it crashes. Unlike every other level, you're not allowed to try again once the company folds, unless you start a new save file (but then you have to do all the other levels over again). Why are Schemes faster? Why are DLLs faster? Why?I could go on. I want to like this game, and I admire the aspirations to educate that no doubt inspire it, but as a product - as a videogame - I'm not having very much fun so far. Looking at the reviews, most people also seem to hit a dozen hours or less before moving on.I would implore the developers to get really good play-testing of this game, start-to-finish, asking at each point whether things are flowing smoothly. It's been rough going for me so far.Not recommended.","I love this game.","If I had this game when I was 10 I'd be a data analyst right now. One of the most accessible ways to learn a very difficult skill\/subject, trust me. I've taken university and online classes on machine learning and natural language processing and this is honestly so much more fun. Not necessarily heavy on the actual writing of the code, obviously, but it teaches you the concepts and gives you a direction. The developers deserve credit for a game well made, especially when it's effectively educational.","relly help me to study about macine learning, best way to give guiede","Education!","Really fun and rewarding. Id recommend this to anyone who likes solving puzzles or tinkering, especially if you have an interest in this games topic.","This feels like the spiritual successor to Jahooma's Logic Box I've been searching for for years, plus gently educational.

The only thing I'm missing is more musical variety.","I got 100% achievements, I like the concept, the artstyle, and the tidbits of real machine learning information, so why am I not recommending this game?This looks like a Zachtronics-style puzzle game but it lacks a few of the things that make their formula so good:1. Puzzles that require you to not just understand the mechanics, but discover a new behavior by combining or abusing them. There's only one or two instances of this discovery I can remember.2. Determinism. To go from a silver to a gold on some levels, I just needed to swap identical pieces around until the game decides an item will go left instead of right, or that it takes 0.2 seconds less.3. Multiple ways to solve a puzzle with different strategies. Most levels in first half of the game have a predefined solution that you're just creating, and it doesn't open up much later.That said, I think this game is charming and it introduced me to some new ideas. If you go into it with different expectations, I think aspiring developers will like it.","A fun game about high level programming that teaches some AI and ML concepts"],["A fantastic puzzle game that strikes a great balance between fun and educational.","One of the best puzzle games out there.

It really depicts the eternal struggle of machine learning while keeping things simple enough for regular people. The developers did a really good job maintaining this balance.Many compare it to Zachtronics games but I wouldn't do that. This game stands on its own feet and proudly so. The only downside? It has too many cats and no dogs at all :(","At first, I found the game tedious but now (after some improvements over the past year) I totally recommend this.

Really like the MegaMap game add-on. logic skills are tested and I feel it improves my programming work flow when I'm on a project.","Similar to a Zachtronics game but lacking what makes those games good. I think there's a design philosophy problem here. For example, some puzzles can only grant a gold medal once you've later purchased hardware upgrades. Maybe that's meant to seem realistic, but it doesn't make for good gameplay when you beat your head against the wall for an hour trying to find a solution which doesn't exist.This design problem also leads to some greater systemic issues. For example, \"startups\" simply don't give enough feedback to understand the mechanics, let alone use them well. If your user base isn't growing and parallelization doesn't help, there's no visibility as to why that might be the case. And you can't retry them either as they just go bankrupt and you're left scratching your head as to what went wrong.And then there are bugs on top of this, such as a solution working just fine until a save is loaded and then no longer growing the user base for no obvious reason. Or cut and paste suddenly stopping working. Or cutting and pasting randomly rearranging all of the connections.This could have been a decent programming-like puzzler, but it just doesn't get there.","Cute Introduction to Programming","I really like the puzzles and the fact that it also gives you resources to real world scenarios.","I've only been playing the game for a short while, but I must say i'm particularly impressed by all the links to more information  about the subjects presented.

Additionally, the music and atmosphere are delightful and the game itself is intuitive and fun!","Thought it would be more like human resource machine or 7 billion humans but this game is far more repetitive and the explanations are far less clear, especially in the startups where you only get one shot and it's really not clear whether to aim for minimal server cost or maximum throughput until after you screw up and can't go back.  There are some interesting aspects with programs that need to be faster and less accurate not being able to adjust the accuracy of a trained perceptron is a little odd.  It really feels like there is more trial-and-error than i'd like in a game like this.","This is a fun puzzle game, with informative links to the key concepts involved in machine learning and deep learning practices.

This game does a good job of providing ML resources, but the game itself the interface is very clunky and it doesn't do a good job of teaching the abstraction of the programming in itself.  It may have some use to new programmers to understand branches but this style of visual coding I always found to be a poor teaching tool.  Flow charts do a better job.","Enjoyable while learning ML & AI concepts.  Really makes you think.","This is a great fusion of learning and entertainment. I love the node-graph style puzzles and it's just a very chill atmosphere game.I'm already familiar with node graphs, so I was initially irritated by being unable to connect an output to multiple inputs, but I guess if they allowed that the game would be too easy.As a programmer with zero experience in ML, I feel this teaches some broad concepts and vocabulary that would make getting into ML much easier.","I learned something today","Amazing game!","This is a game that, mechanically, I should love. If it was just abstract problems and facts about real-world machine learning technology, I would probably like it a lot. I love optimization puzzles, and I'm often looking for a new one.However, the story elements underline the worst parts of silicon valley startup culture: unquestioningly implementing technology for morally ambiguous or downright evil clients, and ignoring one of the main failings of machine learning technology: reinforcement of existing biases when constructing and training models.There are multiple startups that you have the opportunity to work for, and they're practically necessary if you want to be able to afford new hardware to get the best scores on earlier problems. When I got to one which is a caricature of a despotic dictator asking you to help create a tracking system to send political dissidents to concentration camps, all couched in tongue-in-cheek barely-veiled euphemism, I'd had enough (not to mention the dictator's name had \"baboon\" in it, which I think many would agree with me is quite racist, given the racist trope of comparing Black and brown people to monkeys and apes).I find all of this especially concerning given that it's clearly aimed to appeal to a younger audience, who are still developing critical thinking skills.I'd say if you're looking for a puzzle game based on how computers work, check out Silicon Zeroes, SHENZHEN I\/O, EXAPUNKS, or TIS-100. Unfortunately, none of them specifically feature machine learning, and each of them focuses on much lower-level (in the computer science connotation) computing.","Picked this game up to pass the time while I wait for jobs to run and in between coding breaks.

I got trully irritated on how many times the game removed the \"If...Else\" node option just because it wanted for you to create solutions using more complicated and less effective nodes. I liked the ideia the some nodes take more time to return a result than other, they should have leaned more into that, instead of creating more contrived situations. I really recommend the game because is has some great ideias and excellet material, but as for coding games, there are better options out there.","A fun game that makes you loses hair over time","One of the amazing games I've ever played.

The only challenge really is how to balance the data so the outputs are satisfied and this is really just splitting the data up at certain points which is ok.... when doing it once. But not 10 levels in a row.There's a reason Spacechem only threw that  at boss levels.... it's damn boring.The issue is that it's not rewarding to beat a level. They aren't clever or anything and just feel like a grind, rather then actually solving a puzzle.I don't know how startups are supposed to be played because besides the first few they just go bankrupt for no reason that I could think of and you don't get a second go at it so it's like... yea - it stays a mystery.

The game uses a GUI format to introduce these concepts and provides more traditional educational links to lectures and demos that further illustrate the topics. You may not learn how to program your computer to learn cat talk but you should walk away with how to begin thinking about how to solve these problems.","Hey devs, if possible, I'd be glad to have a talk with youBroadly speaking, this game itself is more like a live museum, telling players about what happened in the history, and explain it a little bit to you. But the problem here is that, aside from actually stop playing the game and go search or learn something, players don't get anything out of the game itself. Instead of treating it like a programming game, this is more of a trial-and-error block building game. 50% of the content is about leveling the output as required, for example 30:10:15, this is not the original intention of the game i suppose, right?I really wish there will be a change on your next game, as this one is really not satisfying.

GJ and keep doing edu-gaming stuff like this. Thumbs up!","2 Hours at the time of writing this, and I'm hooked. The game is not only really interesting and informative, but it's also very charming. It's not just a puzzle game, it's half a \"Developer simulator\". You can join startups, make code for said startups and then watch the money roll in, and when the hype dies, you sell your assets and cash out. Amazing. Highly recommend for anyone thats even slightly interested in programming\/machine learning","Good game but there seems to be an odd bug where the game just stays open in the background...'while True:Open(hidden)' maybe?","This is mixed positive review. From the start this game is fun and additive but after a while it start to be repetitive. More complicated aspects of machine learning are to easy (I agree that this is difficult aspect to came up with good gameplay). So game is most difficult at beginning and easiest at the end. What I also don't like is upgrades that need to be bought to get all gold in levels (I so much hate this mechanics in all games, that you need to repeat level that your solution was good from very beginning and you just wasn't able to get gold by invisible wall). Startup mechanic is nice, to bad it's to much based on RNG.Pros:- nice and addictive game play at the beginning- interesting subject - startup mechanicCons:- need to replay levels to get gold- puzzles to repetetive- reversed difficulty curve- need to train nodes in all levels from the beginningOverall: 7\/10","Definitely would recommend . Really fun puzzle experience that actually does have a lot to do with machine learning. Love the touches like CatOverflow.","Gets very repetitive, very quickly. I did not have high expectations for the amount of machine learning that would be taught but this still fails to live up to it. This is not a machine learning game, but a sorting game. Honestly this reminds me a LOT of the marble drop game from 1997. That was honestly a way better game that does basically the same thing.","Fun experience! Good for puzzles that are related to programming, and if you like puzzles in general. It could be seen as a macro perspective for dealing with constrained resources, and how to make algorithms more efficient. The story enriches the atmosphere in a playful way.","hfggggggggggggggggggggggg"],["Good RL references and love the cat puns <3","This game is a tedious puzzle grind whose only relationship to machine learning is a paper-thin layer of theming. In most puzzles, the main challenge is allocating a small pool of colored shapes among bins in very precise ratios. (And, no, this has little to do with precision\/recall\/any other metric - it's more like: make sure between 40 and 50% of red triangle inputs get in bin A, and the rest go in bin B.) This is initially sort of amusing but quickly becomes boring. I would love to see a machine learning game that actually engages with the topic, and I think there could be some interesting puzzles or resource allocation challenges set up around training data selection, recognizing and avoiding overfitting, etc. Allowing more flexibility in user solutions and moving to Zachtronics-style scoring rather than the medal system this game implements would also be huge improvements.There are better puzzle games than this one, better programming games than this one, and I doubt this game will teach you much about machine learning other than occasionally linking you to some supplementary reading. Give it a pass.","I like this game - it gave me a pretty good overview of Machine Learning generally.However as a developer, I wish that they would include actual code (probably Python, with libraries like Tensorflow or something) eventually as well, so once you got the concepts down, you could try them in actual code on actual practice data sets to get an idea of what you're doing.I assume most of the people purchasing this game are either developers or aspire to be developers, and I think bridging the gap between the conceptual ideas and the actual implementation in code would be awesome for later lessons, or an expansion pack. I'd absolutely pay for that.That being said, the game is fun and informative as it is, and if you're interested in learning about the concepts in Machine Learning, I think it is a great starting place.","I really, really don't like this game. This is a boring clickfest and is probably the worst game in my library right now. I'd rather play Bad Rats.Machine Learning is cool, but this is massively simplified. It boils down to: Pick the right tool for the job (pretty trivial since it stops you taking alternative approaches) Set it up (also trivial) Add load balancers until it works Occasionally put something on the cloud ????? In terms of learning value, this game will tell you the names of a few classification algorithms that exist, and roughly what they do. It won't tell you how you'd put them into practice IRL. Maybe it's more useful later in the game, but I doubt it, and I'm certainly not playing again to find out.","As a logic game, it's one of the most engaging one I've ever played. With what I have played so far (I'm passed Dictatorship), the game is challenging but engaging enough to really make you want to try to go for the gold achievement per level. I wonder how crazy this game can actually get..","I enjoy this game a lot, not only the puzzle I found interesting, but also the technical background.","Most of the stuff in this game is about using fuzzy logic algorithms to do things that have nothing to do with machine learning, but more with load balancing. There are several levels with car driving algorithms, which make no sense. You just click buttons until it tells you that you passed.(I am a professional embedded software engineer)."],["It's ok. It's cute and pretty amusing but I would hesitate to actually recommend it. The game doesn't seem to want to be understood, and a lot of the second half of the game just feels arbitrary and opaque, with gradient nodes and training periods that reduce the error levels of your neurons that aren't really optional and are just an extra step you have to do before you can actually start solving the puzzle.The game's abstraction of machine learning is just too abstract. The error levels and randomness sometimes reward you a gold medal as though by RNG instead of by puzzle solving, and the upgradable nodes mean some gold medals are just near misses until you go back over them at the end of the game with faster processing speeds unlocked.The startups are actually pretty cool. I'd like to see more of them. It's actually pretty neat how you have to figure out via trial and error that it's sometimes better to have a slow program that only serves a small percentage of your users than a highly-parallelized but very expensive program, although even that's a little iffy because the rules the game uses to determine earnings feel a little off, like it's only considering how efficient each packet is rather than considering overall throughput.The reinforcement learning \/ genetic algorithm self-driving car segments are just awful. Poorly explained and uninteractive, you wind up just setting sliders at random and crossing your fingers. I think the dev thought the gritty bits of genetic algorithms would make a game slow and boring, but they abstracted it a few steps too far and wound up just making a black box with buttons and levers that you can push that might have an effect, or might not, who knows?The educational links were a nice touch but the game itself isn't really a great introduction to the concepts beyond the idea that you have different processing nodes that each do one thing and they are linked together.On the plus side the cat is adorable. 10\/10 for cat cuteness.","ITs a fun and informative game.

I love the links to real world learning material too. Fab!","Pros:- The graphics and sound are clean. The production quality feels high. - The visual editor for solving puzzles is easy to use. It's also easy to use solutions from past puzzles as nodes in your current solution. - The game gives useful links to those interested in learning more about machine learning. Cons:- After a short time, the puzzles become very uninteresting. Most of them fall under the \"load balancing\" category, which means that you spend most of your time figuring out how to allocate output symbols to output streams to match the volume dictated by the puzzle. - The test run does not always terminate when the test is unsolvable, for example if all inputs have been sent to output streams, but the current accuracy and \/ or volume in the streams is not adequate. In these cases, if you want to see what went wrong, you will have to wait for the test to time out until you can view the stats for each output stream. This is annoying in combination with the prior point, when you are trying to debug which stream is getting too many nodes so that you can balance the output. - Most of the machine learning concepts introduced in the game end up being irrelevant to the puzzles. In particular, the reinforcement learning puzzles and RNN puzzles don't let you use the ideas to come up with clever solutions. The RL puzzles give you a lot of knobs to play with, but the puzzle doesn't require anything other than sending some inputs to the output stream. The RNN puzzles give you the idea of RNN, but don't allow you to connect the nodes in any interesting or meaningful way: each node has memory, but you are forbidden from doing anything with it other than feeding it back into the same node that produced it. Overall I don't recommend this game. The puzzles stop being interesting very early, and those that attempt to introduce more complicated machine learning topics avoid the hard task of introducing it in a way that the user can learn about the topic via the puzzles.","Cool game, should go more in depth into concepts but it gets the basics really well.","Hey!First of all an amazing game! I'm a programmer myself and I really enjoy playing it!I'd like to make a suggestion to the authors.

Maybe.","I might not be able to wrap my head around some of these levels, but I'm enjoying myself regardless.

Like Sudoku or a crossword,  but with the added advantage I'm practicing my day job logic skills.","enjoyable, challenging puzzle game.","I like the game, but for some reason whenever I play my monitor flashes to black and back, it happens sometimes even when I'm not playing, but when I am playing this particular game it's really frequent like once every few seconds.Which is weird because It doesn't happen when I'm playing anything else,...I don't know what's causing it, but it kinda makes it unenjoyble for me, but without it, it'd be fun...","Funny and interesting game. But at least in the beginning puzzles seems to be more about probability than ML. But I like that game sends you to youtube to watch videos about some concepts.","I have a hard time \"getting\" programming, but this game offers a very addictive, and fun way to learn the basic thought process of machine learning and programming generally. Essentially, how to break things up into small component parts and individual commands.","While I enjoyed playing this game, it was very brief and easy. But I cannot recommend it.I would give this game a 60%.TL;DR:- Not a programming game- Don't expect to learn anything- Pretty easy, but challenging if you aim for gold medals (max efficiency)- Weird game progression: game elements introduced, then discarded; Sawtooth difficulty- No auto saves (???) Make sure you save constantly because you can lose all your progression at any moment if you run out of money...I was under the impression this game was going to be a programming game like\"Human Resource machine\" or \"7 Billion Humans\". But this is not technically the case.All puzzles are basically the following: You need to sort colored shapes from a random stream into specific categories. To do this, you need to create a program using and connecting nodes together.The twist is that the nodes you use are not the ones you would expect, and there is no efficient way to clearly identify a shape\/color. It's up to you come up with the most efficient way (fewest nodes, best speed).There is also some puzzles that don't require you to be 100% accurate and allow a certain margin of error.This gives an interesting approach on how to solve the puzzles with a different mindset than the one you might use for programming (which I believe is actually a good thing).I was also under the impression I would get to learn more and experiment with machine learning techniques. But once again this is not what the game is about. The game vaguely mentions machine learning techniques (both incredibly dated and fairly recent), while providing you links to learn more about it.Most puzzles are fairly easy. Don't expect something incredibly challenging, except maybe if you aim for gold medals. In which case the puzzle becomes a balancing task to evenly distribute input streams to the output streams. This is frustrating at times when you're just one short for instance.You can also cheese some of the puzzles (infinite loops, using nodes' \"memory\" as a storage instead of trashing them, intentionally \"freeze\" your program and still get a gold medal (1)) which does not look like this was intended at times and could introduced completely undefined behavior when reused as a single node later one.(1) Later on in the game, instead of outputing a certain amount of shapes, you need to maintain the margin of error above a certain level for a certain amount of time to pass the level. This is extremely easy to cheese by intentionally slowing down your program.Some elements of the game are introduced early on and are extremely efficient at sorting shapes. Unfortunately, you don't get to use these later on. What was the point of introducing them at all? They are never brought up again either, even though they might be more efficient than solutions you can come up with without it...There is a puzzle that involves a \"genetic algorithm\" to solve a self-driving car problem. This is an absolute train wreck to be honest.There are many problems with this, but the most obvious one is that you have no idea at all what's going on.You are supposed to \"train\" and \"evolve\" your program, which is done automatically for you (except in the case of supervised learning which actually is the method that works the best in this game). But there no way to understand what's going on. This makes the learning process absolute trash. You can turn some knobs, like with the real thing, but the learning process and the outcome is seemingly random and it sometimes look like the actual learning is a complete regression.A way to visualize all possible agents, a way to properly define fitness (this is stupid to base it on average speed when you car will break at the last moment because frontal sensors only spot cars way too late), better sensor system (no way to distinguish left\/front\/right sensors of the car, absolutely terrible when dodging traffic...)For me this is the worst part of the game. Very frustrating puzzle with completely random outcomes, completely misses the point of what genetic algorithm and reinforcement learning is about.I also didn't like the \"startups\" puzzles. This is pretty hard to explain exactly what is wrong with this. But basically you need to complete a puzzle as usual, except that the reward is not a medal, but in-game money.The problem is that there is no way for you to gauge how your program is doing and what you need to do to increase the cash flow. There is the option to \"patch\" your program after release to potentially optimize\/refine it, but this is useless since you have no way to measure what is wrong with it to begin with.This is fine since you don't absolutely have to do them to complete the game (even to get all achievements). But I think it's just a shame, since it could have been a lot more interesting (e.g. Changing the output after release, actual telemetry of why users are unhappy).In the end, I finished probably 2 startups puzzles since there was no real point doing it.Side note, I also had a bug where I generated infinite money with a startup even though the user rating was awful.Speaking of bugs, the game has no auto saves. There is a \"feature\" in the game where you lose all your progress if you run out of money. This happened to me right in the middle of a playthrough and had to start over from the start.Although there are checkpoints, your previous puzzles won't be saved (which can be used as a single node to simplify your code). Meaning you basically have to start over from if this happens to you...","Fun puzzle game that teaches the history and basics of ML along the way.","Nice puzzle game","Neat little game that shows the basic concepts of machine learning.

After playing for 9 hours, I found that I never really got sucked in like I might normally.I never got interested in the cat, or the decorations, and even the component upgrades didn't seem to affect gameplay in any way. I admit that I'm no programmer, just a casual gamer. I would read the node summary and descriptions each time a new one was introduced, but found little use for many of them. Instead, I would often use only a couple. In trying to understand them further I looked for the descriptions or tutorials again, but couldn't find them, even after selecting the option to show tutorials again.A lovely looking game with great intention, but missed the mark for me.","Very fun game even if you have no knowledge of computers and coding, but especially fun for those with expertise in them.","(work in progress, more to be added later) TL;DR If you're a computer programmer that sees application design in precise logical notation of programming instructions, and without borders defined by workspace, nodes (I'll explain what those are later) and time, this game is not for you. Attempting to approach this with a programming mindset will not work here. If you are a computer science student with a major in machine learning, you will be delighted with your purchase.If you have no knowledge of either, it's possible you may understand from the approach of a new student of machine learning. It depends on whether you can grasp the concept of machine learning.DISCLAIMER. i HAVE 20 YEARS OF PROFESSIONAL I.T. EXPERIENCE, NONE OF WHICH IS MACHINE LEARNING. THIS LACK OF UNDERSTANDING ABOUT THE LATTER MAY BIAS MY REVIEW, BUT CAN SERVE AS FODDER FOR THOUGHT IF YOU ARE PLANNING ON PURCHASING THIS GAME AND THINK IT IS A PROGRAMMING GAME.I gave this game about 15 hours before rendering my decision to recommend or no. It certainly deserved a long trial. The game is about a machine learning developer who is having trouble with designing applications. His cat however seems to get the concept of this and was able to fix what the developer could not. Astounded by this discovery that his cat can figure this out, he attempts to build some kind of interface so he can talk to his cat and glean the knowledge the feline has in his walnut sized furry head.Look, I didn't write the story. I agree it's a preposterous one, even though I myself am a cat lover.Anyways, the story of how the developer attempts to talk to his cat progresses by trying to complete puzzles through the building blocks of machine learning known as nodes (explained a little later).Try being the operative word, in bold and underscored. It really does not do a good job of doing that. The game's interface is a little all over the place, having features and tools buried in areas not mentioned in the tutorial and only later do you learn they are there by accident. Before I contine, what are nodes? As a programmer, I find nodes hard to describe. They're not coding instructions, more like black-box subroutines (procedures meant to perform a specific task) with an input and an output. You can connect nodes with wires in a sequence to solve the puzzle. The puzzle itself has input and output but it's not exactly what you call a file or even a comm port. It's more like a bucket meant to hold a bunch of things like numbers or shapes. While the tutorial explains what to do with the nodes,  it fails on why the nodes are used. Allow me to explain. As a programmer, I understand for example what a conditional branching instruction (like IF THEN ELSE) is and does, but I also know why it's useful. It's a way to change program logic flow conditionally rather than a straight start to end run. I also know what object orientated programming is, and also the value of learning that form of application design. Each puzzle tells me what to do but really not the why. This does not help when nodes are being taken away from me and replaced with new ones after I am introduced to them. I don't get the chance to use the nodes as an assemblage of tools in a growing library. Add on top of this the many restrictions on designing a machine learning solution this game introduces:* The number of nodes I'm allowed to use (depending on whether I'm aiming for a bronze medal solution or a gold one)* The physical size of the workspace* The runtime required for the solution to complete successfully (seriously?! am I on a VMS system here?!)I find I'm either running out of runtime, running out of allowable nodes, or running out of workspace. I honestly thought Zachtronics TIS-100 was a bugger with limitations.The aforementioned nodes are not really useful as building blocks for application design. Maybe that's how machine learning is supposed to work, but it makes no sense for example to make a node that appears to have two choices for parsing data yet still allows a third, fourth and so on to be unfiltered and flow into either of the two decision streams. As a programmer, the pieces should fit together but in the case of machine learning, I'm not getting the glue that puts it all together. Again, as mentioned in my disclaimer above, that's probably because I am a coder and not an abstract thinker like a systems analyst. In any case, this game is for machine learning experts or at least their very clever fans. Programmers and those unable to grasp the abstract thinking of machine learning might find this a frustrating purchase.","Its fun. As a programmer with interest in machine learning, ANNs, computer vision, and other AI related topics I like the way it ties to educational materials regarding those concepts. The tongue in cheek humor is pretty good too.","I'm not sure if I like this game any more. The puzzles are really repetitive and they feel disconnected from the plot, essentially just building a machine to sort different colored shapes into boxes. I tried to get a gold rank in everything and found some puzzles frustrating, simply swapping two identical connections would sometimes change the result enough to drop your rating.As a puzzle game it doesn't really stand out from the crowd in any way, and the learning aspect, while present, is mostly tidbits of information with links to outside sources if you actually want to gain some useful knowledge. Maybe gaining access to higher level technologies will make the game more interesting or educationally relevant, but 9 hours in I'm ready to give up already and just go read a book on the topic instead.","The puzzles are (so far) not very complicated, but learning about the history of machine learning happened, about the concepts involved in this field and testing it out in the \"startup\" games is very satisfying.","A great game for those who love to code or want to learn how","This is  a really fun introduction to ML concepts and I will 100% be on the lookout for more by these folks!","i enjoy","I called in sick to play this game today.","Fun puzzles, polished rewards, progress chart and menus.

Spend time reading articles on Wikipedia or something instead.Pro: Nice artwork, good humor (especially if you're a cat person), and a laudable take on making a number of complicated computing topics more approachable.Con: The actual puzzles are weak.  There are duplicates (the setup\/story might be diff, but the actual solution is exactly the same), or trivial extensions (take previous solution and add a 2nd component in serial).  The AI ones are confusing at best -- you kick off the training and the car gets stuck doing nothing, but eventually it says \"reached target speed\" anyways, and you end up running it and getting gold.  In general, getting gold most of the time (~70%) for various puzzles is fairly trivial, and there's very few that require any thought.For example, the last set of puzzles with neural networks require no thought.  You can choose from one component (a black box), connect the input & output wires, and you're done.  Then repeat it for the next puzzle, then the next.The UI could also use a bit of polish.  You can speed up the execution by 3x, but really should have a higher ceiling for when you're iterating on a problem.

Atmosphere and game is fun but so far the puzzles are not delivering.","A decent puzzle, but don't expect to actually play with machine learning. Also it's somewhat short. I'd give it \"Neutral\" instead of \"Recommended\" if I could.For the machine learning they tell the history of it and have links to serios resources.But in the game itself I haven't found anything that is close enough to the real world. All the intersting stuff is represented as a single node, for example RNN (recurrent neural network) is just a single (i.e. atomic) node that magically does what you need. And when you \"train\" it, you just \"magically\" make it work better. It is probably hard to gemify this complex topic, but I hoped that developers will manage to do it better than they did.The game is still reasonably fun, just don't expect to get machine learning outside of the story and node names.","gt fuick cayt manj","Educative, interesting and funny.

An arbitrary global resource system acts as an incentive to not go back to earlier puzzles (and even lock yourself out of them!), there's components that just don't work as well until you spend real-world time letting them \"tune\" (without any sense that there's an in-game cost), assembling programs is done entirely through a somewhat subpar visual flow design language (please look at real visual programming languages for convenience features before making your own), and in general it tries to make you feel like you know something of what's going on, while not really providing insight into things or having much more than loose control over what happens.I guess it's somewhat realistic in those senses, but the state of the ML industry doesn't necessarily make for a fun game, just like the state of actual swordfighting doesn't."],["Great game, set your own pace and make it as in depth as you wish you'll enjoy the logical puzzles and reading about how it relates IRL to systems of functionality take it as far as you want to.","Best cat game on steam. 5\/7","Nice puzzles that are approachable and help familiarize you with some cool machine learning stuff!","cute. filled with easy accesable info. and you learn some stuff.

At first I wasn't sure I would keep the game but I think I will","I love Zachtronic's coding games (SHENZEN I\/O, TIS-100, EXAPUNKS), but this felt more like an educational tool than a game. Some of it's mechanics are just.. nonsensical. For instance,1. The maximum simulation speed is 3x, for example, which is a bit too slow.2. Some of the machine learning nodes have an accuracy that you must improve by giving the node sample data. This sounds interesting, but.. it's not a game mechanic. It just means you click \"training\" at the top, and.. wait. That's it. It might take longer depending on how much data actually currently reaches the given node. I didn't get very far into the game, but at one point I waited about 45 seconds until I saw the little % error number reach 20% (the minimum).3. Finally, and perhaps most egregiously, the input data and ML errors are actually totally random, and only a single test is run on your program. Considering the outputs often have a desired accuracy, and a desired \"filled\" state that is lower than the actual income amount of data, this means that sometimes, running the same setup more than once will give you different outcomes. That's not just something theoretical either, on one of the very first levels, I won using less nodes than the developer (got an achievement for it) by simply.. running the test about 3 times until just 1 node reached the proper thresholds for gold. There's a few other complaints I had as well, but those 3 stood out to me as very major. I should also note that, if you got this far and are still interested, this isn't a coding game. It's an optimisation puzzler. You are given nodes that sort shapes by various criteria at different speeds and accuracy rates, and connect them. If that all still sounds fun to you, give it a try. It's cute, I'll give it that.","Nice puzzle game with an educational touch. It shows the different tools (algorithms) that are in play (in a simple way) and also, that data and its criteria can be basically of any business domain. Provides also links to external articles and youtube videos, and some information in-between, if someone is more interested.Well done!","Its a great game to get in the headspace of a programmer.","I'm a software developer and I didn't like it.

Don't waste your money, your patience or your kid's enthusiasm on this exercise in futility.  **  This game COULD be a great learning experience IF the devs displayed enough sense to put a pause button  in during the test runs OR IF they could leave the results of the test runs available, instead of a determinedly vague summary of how one has FAILED!!! Of course they could have, but they didn't. Like that \"Falling Dolly\" game of the early internet, this game is a version of a sick joke hiding behind a banal interface. The devs have made a game that discourages learning and encourages brut-force lockpicking. If the devs just want to browbeat purchasers on how clever and superior the devs think they are and deny any form of discovery, logic development or, indeed, any enjoyment whatsoever, take the word \"Learn\" out of the title (the devs even have it written as a function, how witty!).

As example, the while True: learn() title hints to the traditional C-syntax concepts of program iteration, boolean evaluation, and call to a function, but none of these are really present in the game and definitely not in a way, that you would be able to identify them unless you know them already.When it comes to Machine Learning I do not see any relation to actual data processing, training and classification. A real-world predictive system would have no problems classifying a red circle from a green square when it has been trained with those exact shapes and colors. The real fun would have happened if it had to classify a purple star instead.Furthermore, processing time and transmission speed are major elements in the game, but are not given the credit to their importance in real world applications maybe because they are not tied directly to Machine Learning.

Can you really connect the old red square load balancer to a new machine when you feed something into it that is not red squares, although the output boxes are labelled \"red square\" only (in this case, yes you can!)The customer letters are a fun part but do not relate to the problems you have to solve as they are again about your basic colors and shapes.I actually had more fun doing some of the programming games  from Tomorrow Corporation ( Human Resource Machine, 7 Billion Humans) or Zachtronics ( TIS-100, Exapunks, Shenzhen I\/O) that are more about classic programming.

Each level rewards you with a medal (Gold, Silver or Bronze) which only serves as bragging right, and some money, which is required to buy some Hardware without which some gold medal cannot be achieved (yes, you will be revisiting early levels, and just press [PLAY] again just to see your old simulation run faster than before and grant you that gold medal... Wahey!).Oh, and you also need to factor in \"accuracy\": if an output requires more of a specific data than input has to offer, and that output has a low enough required precision, just wire in some useless crap, and behold as \"it just works\".(Yes, in this game, throwing random data to achieve 100 data sets at 50% accuracy is sometimes better than 50 data sets at 100% accuracy)While building your system, and running it to see how it performs or where it may fail, you'll be overjoyed when you realise that you can't pause the darn thing.Want to check load balance? let it run until the timer for bronze medal runs out, and you'll get the ONLY log you'll get to see in the whole game. No error report, no pause, no stats of any kind... the game doesn't WANT you to learn anything, it just wants you to play with blocks and coloured shapes until finally you meet the arbitrary requirements for that gold medal.Some blocks are introduced and never seen again. Some blocks literally make no sense.Oh, and have fun watching your blocks \"learn\", and by that I mean, wait until a red number becomes green without any input or configuration from you.Also, don't trust the numbers on those blocks, the time it takes for them to process data is painfully not accurate.As a small puzzle game, it can still potentially be somewhat enjoyable, maybe, for a very short while, but maybe for 2 eurodollars, not more, as it won't last past one or two playing sessions.","Pretty fun game about AI and stuff like that, would recommend it if you're into programming\/AI\/problem solving.","Wonderful game, well thought out and fun for anyone.","Awesome game - Awesome humor! Love it!"],["Why does reinforcement learning make no sense? How does my car spend the whole time above the target speed and I get a gold medal?Why is there randomness in a game about programming? Here's a common situation.  The basic sorting node has two outputs and each can be set to output: red, green, blue, or anything. If you have the outputs set to red and green, then send blue through it, it outputs blue randomly. Sometimes this will work in your favor, but most of the time it doesn't. Some gold medal requirements are so stringent that you RELY on this mechanic.  If you go for gold medals, you will often find yourself removing and switching output paths, hoping you randomly get a good result. It might work, or you might end up one element short\/your accuracy will be too low. Either way, you have no control at this point. (It's worth saying that you can eliminate randomness with enough nodes, but when going for gold and silver medals your maximum node count and time are limited.)Generally, this game is solid. Nice visuals, cute story, and the gameplay itself is fundamentally fine. Being a puzzle game, I would expect to use logic and intuition to progress. Not all puzzles here have randomness, and the ones that don't usually feel good to solve. However, it starts to feel really bad when chance is involved.","That's a real fun game.

Improving and optimizing solutions is usually the most satisfying part of this type of game, but that is not the case here. Puzzles also seem pretty repetitive, which I think speaks to a lack of interesting interactions between the various mechanics.It also doesn't really deliver on the promise of helping you develop an understanding of Machine Learning. The puzzle mechanics are  really just loose and superficial analogies. I've learned a lot more on YouTube than here.I think it's a good effort, the developer clearly tried really hard... hopefully they will do some great work later in their career when their game design skills have been honed a bit further."],["Summary: I want to like WT:l but it just doesn't quite come together like it should. While not terrible, there are better games like this out there.Solving the same problem multiple times, yet not being able to import a prior solution or sub component in a practical manner is a huge drawback. Regular need to retrain learning components where it serves no game purpose is time wasting, and even more annoying, is that in some special cases, the components are pre-trained,  so the dev clearly identified that it was a pointless pain but didn't back fill the fix elsewhere.  And some of the Evolutionary Learning Machine problems are merely exercises in trial and error, since the controls are insufficiently documented and process is unclear. Broken links to external articles and video links were also an unfortunate problem.I also wish they did a better job of explaining the real world operation of a number of the blocks and components. I have read other material on machine learning previously and it was disappointing not see the behind the scenes logic fleshed out here.On the plus side, the visual block editing and layout is a well setup. Others have done this, but this is one of the better implementations. The puzzles, where not repeating themselves where interesting enough.Some other programming puzzle games you might look at are: Human Resources Machine and Seven Billion Humans for low level assembly language like logic, and Bomb Squad Academy for logic and electronics inspired puzzles.","Nice game. Take the idea of easy to learn and hard to master and provide a relaxing experience to the player.","A lot of the game isn't very clear how its being evaluated, so a lot of it is necessarily trial-and-error. The theme is cute, but the \"machine learning\" portion just makes you attach an extra dingus and run it a few times more. Adds nothing to the puzzles and doesn't help evoke the theme. In addition, is rife with strange UI decisions that add to a feeling of clunkiness.","a bit like the blueprint of unreal engine.","I wanted to like while True: learn(), I really did. The design is cute and the premise of a game about machine learning is extremely interesting. Unfortunately, there are too many problems for me to recommend it.So, About That Machine Learningwhile True presents itself as something of an educational game with an ML focus, but that theming is only skin deep. Most of the puzzle components are meant to represent concepts found in ML, but once you get past the basics there implementation becomes to abstract to really work. For example, you have to \"train\" a lot of the more advanced components, but you don't really have any control over that training or it's outcomes. You just run the puzzle in a training mode until the error percentage drops enough. The game also pop-up the occasional historical article on ML and related topics, but they're all fairly short and provide little insight on either the field, as a whole, or the puzzles you're currently working on.With all of that said, ML is a fairly complicated topic and I'm not sure its entirely reasonable to expect a game to really teach it with any degree of depth, so it might be better to evaluate while True as just a puzzle game, which is what I will do for the rest of this review. Unfortunately, even by that metric, it still fails pretty badly.(Quick Note: Over the course of this review, I will sometimes refer to using code or functions. That's just a convenient way to refer to solutions, or parts of solutions, given the nature and theme of the game. At no point is actual code or programming involved.)Puzzling FlawsUpgradesOne of while True's more subtle, if pervasive, flaws as a puzzle game is that it has an extensive upgrade system, which unlocks both new components, for puzzle solving, and improves the performance of your components. This might not seem like a major problem, since none of the core puzzles require any upgrades to solve, but it's not clear if the same can be said for getting a gold ranking, especially on optional puzzles. Normally, in this kind of game ,if you fail to get the highest marks, it's because you failed to understand part of the puzzle and your solution was flawed. Once you factor in an upgrade system, however, there's always the possibility that you failed because you simply didn't have enough upgrades or, conversely, that you succeeded via brute force rather than skill. Both possibilities are frustrating and they're by other flaws that make it hard to tell what happened and why.Reuse That CodeLuden.io wanted to teach that reusing code is a good habit, but the way they went about it causes more problems than it's worth. For starters, the entire thing is very clunky. \"Reused\" code comes in two varieties: actual reused solutions, which are just copies of your solutions to prior levels, and DLLs, which are like custom solutions that you can bring between levels. Importing old solutions is probably the more straight forward of the two. Unfortunately, it's also completely useless the vast majority of the time, because all of your old solutions are specific solutions to old puzzles, not generic tools. For example, data comes in three colors (red, blue, and green) and an early puzzle has you filter a mixed input for just red data. That's all fine and dandy, but it's also completely useless if you actually want to filter for green data or blue data or if you want to do something other than discard the other colors. Sure, you can technically rewrite the old code for the new color, but at that point you're not really reusing the old code, are you, so what's the point?DLLs, on the other hand, are more generic. You create them as their own, while on any level, and can import them into any level ... sort-of. The sandbox for creating DLLs is a little bit confusing at first, but by far the biggest problem is that it will give you access to every function you have unlocked, while puzzles will hide any reused code that contains functions they wouldn't normally allow. This means a clever solution for one puzzle might be completely unavailable in another, despite still being applicable. Again, this means you're stuck rewriting code, rather than actually reusing it. To add insult to injury, you initially start off with only 1 slot for DLLs and slowly unlock more through upgrades. This guarantees you'll be rewriting code every time you want to use a DLL, because why not?Should you find a piece of reused code that actually works for you, you'll run into a new problem: The inputs and the outputs aren't labeled. That's not a big deal if there's only one or if you're doing something simple, like evenly splitting inputs, but if you're output is at all complicated you'll need to either encode the nature and order of the outputs in the title or you'll need to repeatedly check the old solution to figure out which type of data corresponds to each of the tiny green arrows. So, why would you ever use these features, you might ask? Well, the simple answer is they're faster. A solution contained in reused code will run faster than an identical segment implemented manually, even if that \"solution\" is just a single function. When the main difference between a good result and a mediocre one is time, that's a pretty strong incentive. It's also a fairly obtuse one and, like the upgrade, detracts from your ability to judge the actual quality of your solutions or the reasons for your successes and failures.To be blunt, that sort of incentive should not exist in a puzzle game. If the developers wanted to emphasize reusing code, they should have made reusing code more convenient than handcrafting a solution every time. After all, that convenience and reliability is why reusing code is good, not because copying and pasting lines somehow make them run faster.A Lack of FeedbackFeedback is an important component of any complicated puzzle game, doubly so if optimizing solutions is also a major focus. Unfortunately, while True provides terrible feedback, especially compared to other similar games.For starters, the only way to get any feedback is to run a solution to completion or timeout. This means there's no way to get a partial analysis of your solution. More frustratingly, it's possible to fail a puzzle fairly quickly by not distributing data between outputs correctly, but simply running out of inputs doesn't end the trial and stopping it early prevents you from seeing the results, so if you want hard numbers you might be stuck waiting for a while as a timer ticks down and literally nothing happens. This wouldn't be too bad, except the time limit for bronze can be more than double gold and there's no way to view past results without recreating the solution and running it again. So if you need to double check which of your outputs got 5 extra packets of data, so you can try to redistribute them, you could be stuck twiddling your thumbs for minutes per actual attempt and setting it to 3x speed doesn't help nearly enough.What Difficulty CurveThis is more subjective, but even when taking all of the other problems into account, the difficulty curve is all over the map. Some of the early puzzles are frustratingly obtuse, requiring careful use of reused code or careful calibration of component accuracy, while later levels are completely strait forward and easy to perfect, even bonus levels. Also, before anyone asks, no I don't mean you can have a meaningful effect on how a component's accuracy changes, I stand by what I said earlier. It's just that you can sometimes create faster solutions by using less than maximally accurate functions, so sometimes you might want to stop their training early. Not that there are any tools to help you figure out when this is the case or what level of accuracy is optimal, meaning brute force trial-and-error is your only option, assuming you don't just look up a solution online.","While its a nice and short puzzle game and has some interesting links to machine learning integrated, the story is completely off-putting and boring and it has about as much to do with actual machine learning as Space Chem has with creating molecules.It feels like your slightly-better-than-average Kongregate flash game.","Meow Overflow","Fantastic game!

If the puzzles themselves were interesting, this would still be a recommendation, but sadly they are not. All you're doing is sorting colored shapes (red\/green\/blue circles\/squares\/triangles) into outputs with varying goals and building blocks. You'll encounter sorting blocks such as:- a sorter with two outputs that can direct one color to output A and another to output B while distributing the third color randomly- a sorter with two outputs that can direct one color to output A and the others to output B- a very slow sorter with three outputs that can split the colors perfectly- a sorter with three outputs that could split the colors perfectly, but has an error margin- a sorter, that needs to be trained first by putting a gradient block in front of it to reduce its error margin- a sorter, that needs to be trained first by creating new generations\/mutations of it to reduce its error margin- a sorter, that needs to be trained first by putting a gradient block in front of it to reduce its error margin, but which also has completely useless - yet annoying - inner connectionsDid that sound repetitive to you? Well, probably about as repetitive as the game. It's a nice idea to depict deep learning as a sorting puzzle and try to introduce blocks that mimic gradient descent, genetic algorithms and recurrent neural networks. But in the end, training the blocks has absolutely zero challenge and is only there for the theme, but it makes the game 10 times more repetitive.So, are the puzzles at least difficult? Well, most of them aren't, but some of them actually are. Sadly, most of the time for reasons that are even detrimental to the theme:- Often, you have a FINITE supply of colored shapes to sort into the outputs and each output has a TARGET amount of shapes it has to recieve. In the harder levels of this type your main focus becomes getting enough shapes to each output and sorting becomes secondary.- Sometimes you want to parallelize your solutions until you notice that load balancer blocks are actually the only thing that costs anything. The cheapest thing in the real world is the most expensive in the game and your actual neural networks are for free? That's stupid. Well, if it would make the game better from a gameplay perspective, I could live with that, but that's not the case either. It's just another random decision.The final ingredient of the game are a multitude of links to websites about AI-related educational resources. If you wanted to motivate someone to investigate these topics, simply giving them this list of links would probably be more effective than making them play this game.Maybe this review as a whole sounds more negative than it should. The game is most definitely not complete trash. It has a solid basis, but it would have required a few more ideas to make the blocks actually work similar to their real world counter parts and to make training them an actual puzzle itself as well as a game design overhaul and a rebalancing."],["Excellent way to learn, so much fun!!","good game","Cool gameplay for someone who didn't about machine learning at all.","Fun, interesting and educational game."],["I don't quite understand all of it yet... even if it is easy.","It's a puzzle game.

I have a little know-how on visual programming (grasshopper and dynamo) but hoped to learn more about it through a game and this looked interesting enough, but this is more like concepts and puzzles.Also, my biggest pet peeve in any games are timed \"quests\/missions\", and this game has that annoying mechanics instead of focusing on creating beautiful or creative node usage\/solutions. I'm not sure if in actual code practice, how quick it is able to execute is always the better solution."],["ASKED FOR REFUND!This supposedly educational game comprised of puzzles has an otherwise gameplay unrelated support\/endorsement of dictatorships about 15 puzzles in as a mandatory level.My family fled Italy during Mussolini's government and later had to endure a different military regime in another country.I find it disturbing and distasteful that an educational game would have a character simply accept to work for a dictatorship when it is not supposed to be a political or war game of any kind and has no connection with anything else presented so far.ABOUT THE GAMEPLAYComponents are not clearly explained.The interface is clumsy and unpolished.If you want to double check your previous result, you have to run the puzzle again. There is no way of reopening a results window once it closes.Undo button is close to the quit puzzle button, frequently sending you back to the general menu and clearing your undo stack.Switching conditions and remaping connections to say the same thing in a different order sometimes changes results with no explanation.Overall the whole user experience is just poorly designed and keeps turning a somewhat promissing concept into a chore rather than a fun activity","Pretty cool game that introduces some important mechanics of machine learning. And it does in such a way so that introduced concepts doesn't feel difficult. The game also points you to few sources if you want to learn further details about the concepts, developers even had added links to some coursera courses. I'm currently working as a freelancer while being an under-grad and I also learned some algorithms about computer vision. If you want to learn about machine learning, this game provides many sources and enjoyable puzzles for you to learn!"],["YES!","Too far from ML. Nothing good to learn. But good enough puzzles. Mission failed since there is a big accent on ML. And you doesn't learn user anything.","Nice to learn","Fun cat game that is really good and fun to play. You can unlock various cats and they will meow if you click on them. And you can pick which cat you have on your desk too.","brilliant fun and a great puzzle game to get your brain working"],["#include <stdio.h>int main (void){    printf(\"I enjoy\");}","J'ai teste la premiere heure de jeu dans une video : https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ne_beoR-2swI tried the first hour of game in a video : https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ne_beoR-2swJeu tres interessant. Je n'ai pas bien compris l'interet des start ups encore. La mienne me coute de l'argent ?! Quelle originalite ...Bravo","A great game for the development of logic","I'm an entry level analyst and learning about this kind of thing at work. Server\/load balancing, if\/else, all this stuff is put in a really pleasant format that helps me understand how our developers see our system. Very cool.","I found it to be a fun puzzle game that helps me have an undoubtedly very \"stylized\" but still handy understanding of some basic engineering concepts.  The story is just absurd enough to balance out the more serious bits as I test and re-test my solutions in hopes for a gold medal.  The \"machine learning\" bit so far seems more like a cosmetic thing since how the learning nodes actually learns isn't well explained or represented, but the game succeeds in my book as a fun intro to node-based programming and logic puzzle.","I have not beat the game yet but I am hoping that there will be some real programming examples at the end. The High level concepts have helped a lot in understanding Machine learning and AI"],["Picked the game up a while ago and have been enjoying it lots. fairly easy to pickup but has a fairly high learning cap. Overall great game.","Cool game.  Just remember to save every so often."],["Longtime fan of games like TIS-100, Infinifactory, Shenzhen I\/O and the such. If you like games similar to that and that involve programming, puzzling and experimenting with many a different solution to a problem for efficiency and effectivity, then the fact that I have played this game for two days and have already purchased it on three different platforms should be enough to convince you to give this one a try - you won't be dissappointed.","I love this game! I know it's not real programming, but this approach makes a very fun puzzle game. I like the playful approach to it all. A great game to play to unwind.","This is a short, charming little teaching game about the development of machine learning. It's a fun little bit of educational programming that never quite lets you forget that you are eating your vegetables."],["Nice machine learning-themed puzzle game","Thanks for the good game!Nice puzzles and cute cats.There are some cons though.The idea of putting ML in game is good but I think the puzzles was mainly about building decision trees.And I think there was a lack of ML issues.For example, no train\/test split or data balancing (In game you can train \"perceptron color\" with using only green data). Overall I will not recommend for learning ML but for tasting ML or playing puzzle, it was good to play."],["Have been playing it for few hours, I am addicted to it already !Need to mention that, generally, I am interested in ML and like to do this kind of things (a programmer myself) - so this game attracts me.However, if you are not into this things, it's probable not that enjoyable for you.I give the extra points for including the cat in the game :-D"]]}
