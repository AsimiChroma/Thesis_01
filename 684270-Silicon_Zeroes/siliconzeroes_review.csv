2,2690,"So, I didn't like this game, but some people will. The main thing, I'd say, to warn about is that this game is REALLY ""solution oriented"", not exploratory. What I mean is: There is ONE best way to solve everything. (at least as far as I got) You're given a very specific numerical goal rather than a general goal that you can achieve in a multitude of ways. In other words, this isn't like Factorio, it's more like a math homework problem generator. If you failed geometry and never even took trig like me, maybe avoid this one lol. I had to look up remedial math videos to even try to finish the tutorials and only figured it out by literally copying someone else's picture. I consider myself to have a programmer's mind (Autistic) and am highly logical but with a real weakness in math (ADHD/Working Memory) so if you're like me... maybe don't get this one. I was hoping for something more procedural like Factorio or Production Line/Big Pharma. :\I think the issue is that THIS game is the work that I make my machines do in those games...(Summary: Too ""Te"" for INTPs)"

4,2687,"Excellent engineering puzzle game. Easy recommend if you like this sort of thing. Reminiscent of Zachtronics titles, and while it doesn't quite reach the polish of those titles, it is still excellent in its own right."
5,2687,"it's nice game. computer science/architecture degree is a nice to have. good fun for 10+ hours. re-playability - after few years you forget all that stuff. great potential to optimise your designs in couple of difficult scenarios, can sink whole weekend into single puzzle."

16,2660,"I agree with every negative review as well. It's very clear the game is looking for one, optimal solution. There's no room to experiment, no room to have a correct but slower solution. So many times have I had a puzzle where I just needed a tick or two more and it frustrated me to no end. I also strongly dislike how little things are explained, or how little exposition there is, or how things are introduced only to be taken away from the rest of the game, or how tons of the scenarios are ""hey go do this, figure it out chump"" and you're just like huh??Obviously people like this game, and I'm glad. But this game honestly made me feel really stupid for not thinking exactly like the developer despite coming up with viable, albeit slightly slow solutions."

Probably one of the friendliest ways to self-learn about the fundamentals of CPU design, including stuff like pipelines and instruction-level parallelism.

34,2635,"Proper edutainment. Teaches you how cpus work better than any class. It's not perfect. 80% of the puzzles have basically one solution so the graphs showing how you did are basically pointless, but it's worth it so you can learn how to make your own cpu pipeline, complete with ""cache"", speculative execution, cpu bugs that only appear after passing 37 tests successfully that probably make your chip insecure, and pseudo ""hyperthreading"" all in the name of maximum performance."

36,2635,"This game is extremely addictive. I started playing having fun with adding 2 numbers. Next thing I know I'm designing a CPU for a given ISA and it's well past midnight. Definitely a good game to play. My only criticism is that I wish the delays in stage 3 were displayed similar to Opus Magnum, I find the current layout a bit hard to understand."

40,2625,"A hidden gem, similar in style to many of Zachtronics games although this one is not from them.It has a nice mix of relatively easy puzzles which serve as a tutorial for how computers work with some that are hard to beat. ( ""Cows"" and ""Multiplication"" in particular from the ones I've done so far. )"
41,2620,"You can tell by the number of hours I have played that I am currently addicted to this game.  I love solving puzzles, especially those that take some mathematical thinking. Some of the puzzles are trivial, some reasonable, and some extremely difficult. It is fun just to get a ""chip"" working.  To get some of the achievements, you need to solve the problem using only a given number of modules. In others, the goal is to have your ""chip"" run in a small amount of time. The game is not a realistic view of chip design, but it does introduce some issues.If you like math and programming, my prediction is that you will enjoy this game."
42,2619,"Silicon Zeroes is a fantastic game that teaches you step by step how computers do their ""magic."" It oversimplifies some things but that is a good thing in terms of learning, as a CPU is one of the most complicated things that can be built. No one is going to learn how to do something that complex instantly, and this game goes gradually enough that anyone can follow along.My only real complaint is when it gets past the first two sets of puzzles, it adds an unnecessary multi-tick element to the clock pulses that makes things ridiculously complicated and not nearly as much fun to solve, not to mention that it's not accurate in terms of real hardware. The firsts sets of puzzles are great, but I got tired of the tedious hoops you have to jump through to build the remainder. There is no reason it couldn't continue without the multi-tick problem. Perhaps the puzzles would not be as difficult then, but as earlier stated, CPU construction is already very complex and difficult. It doesn't need additional, artificial difficulty to be added."
43,2618,"Solving fun little puzzles, much like any of these games ... but before you know it, you're putting together a whole little computer! The interface is pretty smooth too. Fun and recommended."
44,2613,"There are LOTS of interesting puzzles which offer a sandbox of parts you can use to create interesting and novel solutions - this isn't one of those games.Here, parts are limited (in some cases PAINFULLY so) to the point there is likely ONE solution to the puzzle and it's an exercise in frustration and repetition trying to find it.Every puzzle I found myself thinking ""if only I you could set X or change Y"" but you can't because the designer has ONE solution in-mind and you've got the parts to make that and not much else.YMMV but I found this game more annoying than fun - it's closest parallel would be TIS100 but even that (a game defined to be VERY limited) feels less ""one track"" than this..."
45,2612,A programming game except incredibly restricting and obtuse. It starts out fine and then all of a sudden you hit a difficulty wall; you go from making calculators to making CPUs in like half an hour. The timers are what killed me. The background story is cool and goes through a neat history but I wanted more code and less electrical engineering. Could be for you though!
46,2611,"Very satisfying fusion of logic circuits simulator and a puzzle game. Lack of a binary representation of numbers makes some tasks a bit tricky, which is not necessarily a bad thing.There were only two really big downsides for me:1. Wiring. Automatic paths quickly become a mess, and handling them manually is incredibly tedious when moving components around. This is somewhat mitigated by highlighting connected endpoints, but barely.2. Components cannot be rotated, as far as I've seen. This amplifies the first problem."
47,2611,"I've played quite a few ""assembly programming"" games, but this one is probably my favorite so far. By giving a single metric for optimization, it makes the goal of optimizing every puzzle maximally a reasonable one, which I always appreciate. I don't know how this one slipped under my radar, but I've really enjoyed it!EDIT: In the third section, they introduce a new optimization method (execution time), but it fits in nicely. It turns one puzzle into two!"
48,2609,"It is a interesting little game, but definitly suffering from very bad writing.The puzzles are fine, the premise is better than the actual challanges, but annoying to solve because of the interface. It's not bad.Other ""programming"" or mathmatic puzzles have weak stories and might fail to interest you, this one is bad and even kinde of annoying as it is mixed in with instructions making me choose betwen tips and instructions and not suffering from the writing. Maybe you enjoy it if you like stories about steriotypical blatant sexism and incompetent men, if you don't need actually good writing behinde it.Pros:- Good Premise- Fine Puzzles- Good difficultyCons:- Cluncy Interface- Interesting choice of modules available (not important if you dont know assembly, any programming language or boolean logic)- Very bad writing- Annoying narrationstyle"
49,2609,"Great game to share with all your engineering mates, or people who like tough puzzles.Zachtronics-like - albeit a little more rigid."
50,2609,"This is the best game that attempts to explain how a CPU actually functions that I've ever played.  I haven't finished it yet, but I am amazed with the concepts that they were able to introduce so far and how the devs were able to reduce these computing concepts to something that could be presented as a game.  Many computing games focus on writing code and abstract away the logic that a CPU is actually doing.  If a puzzle game does get into logic operations, its often been oversimplified in order to make it a more accessible game and loses too much of the computing background that they are trying to present.  Silicon Zeroes keeps all of the computing concepts and presents it in a perfectly understandable package.  The increments in the puzzles are just small enough that it's very easy to see how each puzzle builds on what came before but also large enough that each puzzle presents a new challenge.  This is a must play for anyone with an interest in computing."
51,2608,"Truly great game, if you like this kind of stuff, i would recommend this one. Just a little con, was all that SJW bull***t really necessary?"
52,2607,"If you liked Human Resource Machine but would prefer fewer humans, try this."
53,2603,"Before I begin, I was a computer programmer in the I.T. field for 20 years. I have little to no experience in actual electronic design. I mention this on the off-chance this could prejudice my opinion and I have enabled comments for people to call me out on that.I believe when you start any sort of game, be it a shoot'm-up style, an RTS, or a sandbox, you have to know what you're doing with the basics. For example, if you are told to shoot at something, it would be nice to know how to aim and press the trigger on your gun first. You shouldn't be given the gun and then told, ""figure out how to use it"". Let's take an RTS as another example, like Starcraft or Warcraft. You're told what each of the buildings and units do, before being told to take out an enemy base.I mean, c'mon, would you try building a house without knowing how? Foundation? Wiring? Plumbing? Drywall?Silicon Zeros is a good game but it has an absolutely terrible way of getting you started and that ruins it right there. I mean, it started off right with the introduction: I'm a student named Dana who was hired by a startup company in the 1960's to help said company get off the ground. Where it goes off the rails is during my first request to make sure the adders are working. In order to confirm this, I'm told to configure the wiring so the adder output is 2.Okay, first of all, how does one use an adder? Yes, it's obviously an addition unit that formulates a sum but I don't know how to use it. I try right clicking the fields and am told in the hottip text there's nothing there. Well, YES! I can see that! I'm trying to put something IN there! I then click on the nearby tag with the 1 and learn that's a constant output value of 1. I dragged a wire from that tag to one of the two fields and got one of the two values in there so I'm half done...but I need another output .....perhaps another 1 outputter? Sure, but where the hell do I go to get that?I mean, I'm struggling with this like some caveman being asked to make fire with dry twigs.  I'm clicking with all three buttons on my mouse to find a way to change the output of that tag with no success. It was through an accidental dragging of a wire during frantic clicking that I found you can split the wire and connect it to both add fields. Now we have 1 + 1 equaling 2 and the puzzle is solved.Or did I solve it? I mean, the infinite monkey theorem states that a monkey hitting keys at random on a typewriter keyboard for an infinite amount of time will almost surely type any given text, such as the complete works of William Shakespeare. In other words, even the dumbest person with tons of time WILL complete what was asked...but will he or she UNDERSTAND what they did and why? That was not the impression left in me.On to the next puzzle. Two adders, one outputter of 1, wire them to have the final sum add up to 3. All right, what are the rules of wiring these things in serial? How many wires can I attach to each module and where? Again, trial and error to generate some sort of outcome. There's no real planning based on an understanding. I'm trying to drag a wire from one of the first adder's input field to the second adder's upper field but I kept breaking it instead of branching it. I went back to the output field of 1 and was able, again through desperate guessing, to create and drag a third wire OVER the first adder to the second adder's upper field and the sum result of the first adder wired to the lower field of the second adder. Okay, that worked, but what a way to learn!The third puzzle was more of the same guess and go. Try wiring things to get an outcome rather than, you know, explain through examples on how things work. Next puzzle, the configuration one, reveals that the right click functionality of the outputter tag was in fact TURNED OFF in the first puzzle. Yes, apparently my right clicking from the first puzzle was the correct thing to do after all, but because it was disabled, I assumed it was wrong to do that. Now I'm wondering just how much of the full functionality of the game was switched off and as I progressed further, it was a great deal. Apparently you can add more than one number tag outputter after all. There are also other kinds of modules, like subtract and equal that were also hidden, and in some puzzles, hidden at the wrong time when really, they should be available. The Cow puzzle for example could have used the equal module to really simplify things to get the total number of calves born. This guesswork approach of learning is not good for another reason. You're not getting taught the really important things needed for more complex circuit design...like how to create a repeating loop, how long a tick is, how to work with timing in parallel wiring and so forth. These things, much like everything else, is left to guesswork for you to perform. If there was a sandbox to experiment in with all the available parts, I'd be more forgiving. As of this writing, I haven't found one and I'm not sure if the game, unlike others like Opus Magnus and Shenzhen I/O, has one available. It could be unlocked after some progression in the game, but I think that's a mistake to do that.Learning is not guessing, it's imparting knowledge through rote of example. Explain what, how, and why this is so. As I said, this is a really good game but it trips up horribly on the way it introduces people to the game concepts. It should take cues from other circuit design puzzles like Ones and Zeroes (another Steam offering) through a gradual stepped learning curve that builds on the previous lessons taught. If you are patient and willing to put up a lot of aggro trying to learn through this method, perhaps you will get a lot more out of Silicon Zeroes than I did in my initial efforts."
54,2600,"First, the obvious comparison: If you are a fan of Zachtronics puzzle games, just buy this now!If you haven't played Zachtronics puzzle games, then the important bit to understand about all these puzzles is that they are *engineering* puzzles, in that they don't have one singular correct solution. There are exercises in problems solving within the framework of the tools available to you. Many will be reasonably easy to find a solution to, but much harder to optimize (should you even care to). (This is in contrast to usual puzzle games, which are often about guessing the underlying rules the creator made-up so that you can find the one unique solution.)Essentially, engineering types tend to love these kinds of games, and Zilicon Zeroes holds-up in scratching that itch when compared to the mass of entries from Zachtronics."
55,2599,Computer engineer here. This game is a gem. The puzzles are challenging and on top of that you get to learn digital electronics. One of my favorite games for this year.
56,2589,Good puzzle game
57,2585,Brilliant game!
58,2585,"A very Zachtronics style game of basic circuit logic.  Lacking a little polish, but great puzzle difficulty and progression.Early levels turned me off slightly, there's less of a sense of each level teaching you something new, making you want to revisit earlier levels to optimize them.  Also, it's lacking a ""solution manager"".  Each puzzle saves its most recent state only.Those minor flaws aside, the puzzles get quite challenging, and I find myself enjoying the game more as difficulty has increased.  Well worth the investment if you enjoyed ShenzenI/O and Exapunks."
59,2583,"This is, to date, the least enjoyable entry in this sub-genre for me, with several major issues that prevent me from actually having a good time with it.First off, the cycle count requirements for completion are excessively strict. The designer has a very specific solution in mind for each puzzle (which is generally an optimal or near-optimal solution), and all but the smallest deviations will be met with failure. In other words, you have to devise a near-optimal solution to most puzzles just to advance, rather than optimization being something you pursue after successful completion - not that optimization is all that interesting either in this game, due to the particular set of metrics solutions are judged on. As a result, there's very little reason to revisit completed puzzles, and you will almost never want to revisit a puzzle because a later puzzle taught you something you could apply to it.Having real-world knowledge of the subject matter is detrimental; many real-life solutions are not workable within the game's constraints, while some puzzles encourage degenerate solutions that would never fly in reality.The pacing is off, with new components frequently being added for a puzzle or two before being removed for many puzzles, before you've had an opportunity to get really comfortable with how they work.Then there are all sorts of minor interface issues. For example, a register file can contain between 1 and 8 registers, and the most generally useful size for a register file is 4 registers, so of course the default size for one is 2 registers.The game maintains an unnecessary separation between edit and sim mode, which is made worse by the fact that in some situations it will switch from one to the other as need, while in others you are required to switch manually.Wires become increasingly indistinct as you add more of them, which is made worse because you can't meaningfully group them into buses, and even when there aren't very many of them they're still not particularly distinct from one another, because they are distinguished only by color, and each wire's color is quite close to the previous wire's.The solution palette is a pain to manage - and you will need to manage it, because it will rarely be clear which sections of which solutions will and will not be useful in the future, and even when they are useful, it's generally for only a small handful of puzzles."
60,2582,"Very few games evoke a kind of puzzle-solving flow where I feel like I'm actually learning something! If you're looking for another programming task puzzler ala Human Resource Machine or a Zachtronics coding game (TIS-100, Shenzhen I/O, or EXAPUNKS), try this one out! I look forward to finishing the main story soon, and trying to make some of these circuits IRL!"
61,2582,Great puzzle game.
62,2574,I built a CPU! This game definitely isn't for everyone but if you like a puzzle game that can help you learn about the logical components for a computer then I highly recommend. This game made me become more interested in learning about electronics and the inner workings of PC hardware.
63,2572,The best part about this game is that I can solve a puzzle and still be fuzzy on how it works
64,2564,"It is clear that this game is a true labor of love. I recommend it to anyone with an interest in computers, and anyone interested in Zachtronics games.The premise is very interesting, and the user interface is good and intuitive.The story is simple, but is a welcome addition.The move to ""milicycles"" later in the game was a very well executed twist to bring fresh technical challenges into the game.The only complaint I have is that sometimes you are prohibited from using certain parts on certain puzzles in a way that can seem arbitrary. But that is only a minority of the levels, and it is not too annoying."
65,2564,Some cool puzzles.
66,2563,"There are a lot of detailed reviews here so let me make it quick.I LOVE IT.I am not the most talented at puzzle games (I tend to give up within the first hour). But this has a really nice progression where I always feel like I have a new problem to solve. Yet I never felt overwhelmed or ill-prepared for the task.The explainations are short but accurate and being able to see all tests and their respective solutions really helps.Content wise I've spent 56 hours so far and have yet to complete a lot of the ""lategame content"" (But I'm not the brightest so you might be a lot quicker)."
67,2561,"Start slowly but after the first 30 minutes or so it really picks up.  UI is good, puzzles are challenging but not frustrating (at least not yet), story is interesting.  I'd definitely recommend this if you're a fan of something like Shenzhen I/0.  It's different enough that you'll have a new experience but definitely in the same vein."
68,2561,"THE GOOD:First of all this game is fabulous. Whomever designed it and thought it up should be supremely commended as it is an excellent game with lots of great logic puzzles and stuff. It is very fun to sit and work out the correct combination of parts needed to figure out each puzzle. And also to compare unique parts required for my solution compared to others. Also the ""back story"" of the start-up engineering firm is cute and retro in a fun way. If it were not for one little detail, I would give it a 5 stars rating, two thumbs up, and recommend it highly to everyone...THE BAD:The commentary in this game is just dripping with overt misandry, sexist comments about men and goes well out of its way to promote the classic Feminist view that women are nothing more than whiny, b*tchy, helpless victims who are more interested in poisoning the work environment than creating a positive culture and inclusive work environment.There's no place for any of that crap in a game. Keep your SJW nonsense to yourself. I will be posting this review elsewhere also to make sure that people know what they're buying. It's a great game-- the developers should have simply left it at that.Anybody who wants to take issue with me for saying this can blow it out your back hole. I'm tired of all the hateful, sexist Feminist male-bashing."
69,2558,fun game that teaches about basic computing and programming
70,2552,I highly suggest buying this game if you like puzzles... It has a good concept and solving puzzles after thinking about them for hours is really satisfying... most puzzles are easy once you understand how to solve them and difficult part usually is coming up with a strategy in your head...
71,2551,"If you like anything from zachtronics, you will probably like this game also."
72,2551,Wanna play good game?Play this!
73,2551,"This game has a tremendously well-crafted difficulty curve. I thoroughly enjoy these types of programming/building games, and while I love Zachtronics games, there's always a point where I just can't keep up. For me, Silicon Zeroes offered the perfect learning curve that allowed me to stay with it.Furthermore, it absolutely felt as though I were creating a CPU while playing the game. I get a sense that I understand a little more about how computers work by playing the game. It was interesting to discover that the plotline is actually based on true events. All in all, I can absolutely recommend the game."
74,2548,GREAT GAME.It's a NICE Puzzler - I can recommend this one. Starts off with good tutorials and then gradually gets more difficult.
75,2548,gets my autistic brain working LUL
76,2548,"I really didn't enjoy playing this.I love Zachtronics games like SpaceChem and Opus Magnum and I have played nearly 100 hours on each of them.  I looked at this and thought I would love it too, but the game drops you in-at-the-deep-end over and over and I found that most of my time wasn't being spent solving the puzzle, it was spent working out how a new game mechanic actually worked because so much of the game is so poorly explained.It felt like a slog and not in a good way.  More tutorial steps and more in-depth explanations of the modules would be a great help.I don't think I will come back to this game.  I played it for 15 hours and for most of that I was asking myself why I wasn't playing Spacechem or whatever."
77,2538,"Silicon Zeroes is exactly what it looks like - Building computer circuits in a game to solve problems.This idea is the core of everything in the game - The parts you're given are what you'd expect to build circuits from, and the concepts used for the puzzles feel like they're taken straight out of a computer architecture textbook.The concepts in the puzzles can be a bit too abstract with too little explanation however. Quite often you'll be thrown into a puzzle that doesn't use lessons learnt from previous ones and it can be quite difficult to come to grips with what you're supposed to. The clocks and timers don't get the explanation they deserve either.Despite these issues the gameplay itself is well put together - Wiring is easy to disinguish, you aren't constrained by space, the tools are mostly visually distinct, and it feels snappy.Considering it's their first game, I'd be interested to see what lessons they might learn from this, and I'd suggest they take a deeper look at how Zachtronics introduces new concepts and paces the game.For reference, I'm about halfway through the third board."
78,2530,"Designing a functional, multi-stage pipelined CPU and watching it run is extremely satisfying. If you like games like TIS-100 or Shenzhen I/O, then you'll probably like this one as well.The game introduces new challenges at a good pace, though you typically only get a few hints in the title for each puzzle about what you need to do. If you're not familiar with CPU architecture, you may need to do some research on your own. But then again, that can be part of the fun.If anything, my main critisism would be that I wish the game went deeper with some themes like branch prediction or out-of-order execution. Also, the short length of the test programs means that there isn't as much room to optimize your solutions as I might have liked.Still, I had a blast with this game. Well worth it."
79,2529,"I bought Silicon Zeroes because I enjoyed Zachtronics games. This is on on par with them, and I would highly suggest you purchase it if you want more Zachtronics-likes."
80,2526,"Like Zachtronics games, but with some new features. Very fun and challenging."
81,2525,Great CPU-design-themed educational game.Pros:* good buildup of difficulty* shows some real CPU-design challenges* manages complexity by not mixing too many challenges in a single puzzleCons:* Might be confusing without any prior knowledge* Rather shallow story
82,2524,"The best criticism I can make of this game is that it's unfinished.  The game gives you a tool and a problem to solve using that tool.  Then you learn something and beat the level and move on to the next level which introduces a new tool or gives you a different type of problem to solve using that same tool.  Later levels then require you to combine the use of different tools to solve more complex problems.  It's a great gameplay loop that will give the player many hours of fun and maybe even teach them something.The problem is that a lot of those early levels don't even exist.  There are these huge cliffs of complexity you have to scale where the game introduces a ton of new concepts and parts which haven't been introduced yet.  Suddenly you're required to build an entire CPU after you learned how to get the adding machine to add 1+1.I really don't understand the advanced concepts introduced in this game, even after looking at the solutions of other people or trying to do some minimum research into the concepts taught in each level.  People will say this game probably isn't for me and I think they would be right about this specific game but wrong about the genre.  Anybody else interested in playing this game should look into buying the Zachtronic games instead.This game feels unfinished and I regret buying it."
83,2524,Really fun and unique game and you learn a little bit about how computers work in the process.
84,2524,"Neat little engineering game.  Making it through the main game is not trivial, but doable, but optimizing the puzzles to meet/exceed the ""goal"" challenges is definitely a challenge. I apprciate the amount of non-linearity in the puzzle design (once you get to the more difficult puzzles, you probably have 3 or more puzzles to choose from).The art and story is good but not great; but as a puzzle mostly about engineering, I can take or leave that."
85,2524,"I'm 45/74 challenges in, and I'm enjoying it a lot more than I did Shenzhen I/O. It feels like building actual hardware, not like programming pretending to be hardware, so it's much more relaxing. The game doesn't force you to guess the optimal solution right away, and it doesn't force you to deal with low level wiring (which actually makes sense, since it's about wire wrap era, not Shenzhen I/O's PCB era), so it's easy to experiment and try to get something half-working, and then finish or optimize it later.The simulation environment is quite convenient, moving time back and forth, and assembling things is easy. I wish they'd auto-color-code the wires or route them more cleanly - for some puzzles it gets difficult to see what's routed where. Just like with real hardware.On downside it feels like most puzzles have just one ""correct"" solution they had in mind, and you're basically supposed to get it to reach goal. There's achievement for beating the ""goal"" score.There's a bit of variety in mechanics later on - different puzzles have different available components, and some use high resolution clock, while others don't.The game even has OSX version, imagine that. It works better with a 2 button mouse, but it's reasonable with just trackpad and space-clicking things.(there's also some story, but it seemed boring so I ignored it all)"
86,2523,Plays just like a zachtronics game 
87,2521,"Excellent puzzle game. Some of the puzzles are pretty difficult, but your not stuck on them and can still work on others as you go through the 'story'.  I am a developer and I find it fun to solve these logic problems with the components provided."
88,2516,"I really wanted to make my (very) own puzzles,I'm sure it would be great! ;)"
89,2514,"A fun little logic game, that helps to teach the fundamentals of how computers work on the inside at the instruction set level."
90,2513,Fun and challenging game! Well designed gameplay with a great soundtrack.
91,2512,"A game much like Zachtronics games, but maybe a bit less polished. A fun way to get an idea about how CPUs work and why they have parallel execution and pipelines. Most of the puzzles are either about building a CPU with some new feature, or about teaching you the tools to build those CPUs, so if you want a huge variety in puzzles, this is probably not for you.I have a lot of experience with Zachtronics games, so the first two chapters weren't much of a challenge. If the same happens to you, don't worry; the third chapter picks up the difficulty, then the fourth chapter gets truly challenging.The story is also a bit less polished than what you'd get in a Zachtronics game, but these games aren't really about the story anyway."
92,2511,"An interesting cross between programming software and hardware. This is far removed from the actual electronics, but it's still showing direct connections vs. clocked/timed connections. You won't learn how to hook up real electronics to make a CPU, but you'll challange your way of thinking if you're a programmer already. Very interesting take on things like recursion, indirect references, timing issues etc. Definitely a warm recommendation."
93,2510,"Original review: (Feb 12, 2018; 21.5 hours playtime; positive)This game taught me more about pipe-lining than my digital logic and microprocessor courses. Very fun to play, elegantly designed.Updated review: (April 30, 2021; 43 hours playtime; positive)I just reached the 100% completion point. I am very satisfied with this game. Easy to get into, difficult to master. Aesthetic is very nice and I ran into no behavioral bugs or issues.My only critique of the game is with one aspect of the UX. It could have used a better way to save solutions to puzzles than having to copy the entire solution into a blueprint. It isn't always easy with a standard 1920x1080 monitor resolution."
94,2509,I was amazed that this game cracked my brain a hundred times.You will love it and enjoy the challenges of the game and your cows.Building your own CPU........is way...........#@%&?
95,2506,"In the same line with Human resource machine, TIS-100 and Shenzhen I/O, Silicon Zeros introduces some of the most interesting problems in digital design in the form of approachable puzzles, with just enough background story to give the impression you're taking part in the golden age of computer innovation."
96,2505,"Coming to write this review after reading the little ""History"" extra at the end of the story. I simply wanted to encourage the dev by saying that this is a fantastic game, and taught me an awful lot more about CPU architechture than previous sims, such as Logisim, had shown me. I'm somewhat disappointed that this may be the last game the dev makes, as it was a fantastic game, much akin to Zachtronics' games. Dev, if you make another game as good as this one, I'll buy it for sure!In terms of an actual review, the gameplay is phenomenal. It's quite difficult in parts, so patience and ingenuinty is definitely required, but I only found a few of the puzzles so confusing that I had to look up solutions. There's a good wealth of solutions and hints to certain puzzles as well, useful for confirming that your thought process is correct. The graphics are nice and slick, but it would be nice if the blackboard screen could ""blow up"" to a nicer resolution. The music can get a bit repetitive, but it's subtle enough that it doesn't intrude into your thinking. Overall I think this is definitely worth the low price of it, if nothing else for the educational benefit you can get out of it.P.S., might be worth having some understanding of ALU's, Parallel Processing and Caches, but that's not necessary, only make it more interesting seeing real life problems manifest themselves naturally in this game."
97,2505,Great game that strokes the flames of programming and computer science.
98,2505,It's a fantastic game.  The kind of game that wraps its tentacles around you begging you to optimise.
99,2505,"Interesting, if a little short. I enjoyed playing most of the puzzles, and was pleasantly surprised at how accurate to reality it was. My biggest gripe would be the lack of availability of several modules for most of the levels. Otherwise, it's a pretty great game, especially for computer enthusiasts."
100,2504,"If you're a fan of Zachtronics games like TIS-100 and Shenzhen I/O, you're going to love this. The story might not be as compelling and well fleshed out, but the puzzles do a great job of scratching the same itch with low-level CPU design as the framework."
101,2504,"Great concept and implementation. The game walks you through the basics of cpu design and some logic. Although we don't get any flexibily with gate creation, this is still a challenge and a fun puzzle."
102,2504,"I was not sure at first... I was reluctant because - the puzzles looked too simple - the mechanisms looked too abstracted and unrealistic - the demo was pretty boring and had poor instructions - the artwork is not to my preferences--Pros-- - a different approach than other 'programming games' - the complexity seems well balanced (not too frustrating or basic, in my opinion)                 note: not including the first set of puzzles that you can play in demo, those are too easy and puzzles are boring--Cons-- - as others mentioned, the instructions are vague at best - I am still not a big fan of the art style - I still do not like the demoI took a leap of faith on purchasing this... and it is pretty decent after all.It focuses more on wiring and routing instructions than coding, which is cool because it has given me an abstracted insight of how low level computing works."
103,2503,Amazing game. If you liked TIS-100 or Human Resource Manager you will probably like this one as well. Worth the money.
104,2503,"Absolutely recommend this. This game is a well-made. Peer to the Zachtronics series of games, most notably Shenzhen I/O, this allows you to explore the world of creating a cpu from a set series of components. The drag and drop and UI are well done and the debugging experience is quite effective and intuitive. Additionally, the game allows you to experience a number of different cpu architecture designs.The only downside here is that the game might not appeal to everyone as fun, but as a professional software developer, this is a joy and a unique experience bridging the worlds of software and hardware in appropriate levels of abstraction."
105,2503,"Super strong game, similar in some ways to Zachtronics games, but also asks for a different part of my brain (and there is usually something much closer to a ""right answer""). I wish this was getting more attention than it is."
106,2503,"Very well made! I've played several games in this genre (zachtronics games and more), but this is the first one I've played that is pure hardware and handles timing well. Most of the games invovling wiring hardware have the concept of calculation ticks (near instant) and state ticks (usually triggered by all chips waiting). But this game gets the division a little bit more realistic which is just enough to add a fun and interesting challenge.Here you have long clock ticks corresponding to state, and then shorter calculation ticks. So not too different from other games on the surface, BUT different chips take different amounts of time to calculate and the clock tick is a variable number of calculation ticks. It feels like setting up a clock pin to be the maximum time for all signals to propagate from one latch to another in a processor (and it basically is!). It's not 100% realistic, but it was a lot of fun and more fufilling than some other games I've played in the past.Highly Recommended :D"
107,2502,Loved it!
108,2502,This is a great way for learning the basics of making hardware on a PCIt starts from the very beggining up intil making things like processors it's honestly a great experience
109,2501,Great game for those of us who want logic puzzles to also be educational and not merely mental masturbation.
110,2500,"Amazing game; equal in quality and depth to Zachtronics games. It feels like a small game, but in reality it's 15-25 hours of fun. Would recommend to anyone interested in dabbling / learning programming.It's a little harder to pick up - the levels after the end of the game are definitely geared for programmers. It does a very good job at going step by step and introducing concepts slowly, but it doesn't hold your hand at all.It's also a lot more true to real-life than most Zachtronics games. You could actually teach a class using this. And the final prize, if you manage to pull it off, is REALLY impressive.My only complaint is is that the last 3 puzzles after the end of the game are very inconsistent about branch delay slots, and it's never mentioned in the instructions. Perhaps I'm missing something, but the 2nd to last level requires delay slots (and the title hints at it), while in the last level they are an error.It can be hard to find these programming games. If you like this, look up Zachtronics (SpaceChem, Opum Magnus, Shanzen IO) and [The Sequence]."
111,2500,"I am not a huge fan of visual programming, but this game really does it well. There's only two things I didn't really like about it: 1) it lacks the ability to compare your scores to other players (friends and global) that most other programming games provide, and 2) I feel that the palette feature would've been better if it could've worked more like a function in a traditional programming language and less like a copy/paste feature (I didn't have much interest in returning to older puzzles to improve designs, and I found that I was getting worse scores in later puzzles because I opted to copy/paste designs that included unnecessary features because it was easier than trying to Frankenstein them every step of the way and had no way to refine them across the board like what a reusable function would provide).With that said, it is still a very challenging game that slowly eases you into logic concepts and works its way up to you building an entire CPU. You are still using low-level components provided instead of building them yourself, but as far as concepts go, you can still learn a lot along the way."
112,2500,Recommend this game to anyone. Almost every puzzle adds new challenges that can be hard at times even for a software developer. But at the end it's always really satisfying to see the completed level work.
113,2500,One of my favorite puzzle games. Starts off slow and makes sure that you understand all the mechanics well. It constantly introduces new mechanics and different types of challenges and tasks.If you ever wondered how a computer actually works deep down this game will teach you alot and I found it extremly fascinating. Most puzzles aren't too hard but there are some optional ones along the way and a bunch at the end of the game (after the end of the story) wich are very difficult.
114,2499,had to break out my computer architecture notes to beat some of these puzzles.  10/10
115,2499,Excellent Game!!
116,2499,This game is a great way to understand the inner workings of a computer.
117,2498,A brilliant way to introduce children to logic and design.
118,2498,"Oh baby, never could I have hoped for another developer coming even close to Zachatronics games in scratching that engineering itch in me but this definitely did the trick. If you enjoyed TIS-100 or Shenzhen IO you will enjoy this as well.Getting perfect scores in all of the puzzles is reasonably challenging and definitely requires you to think of alternate approaches to problems where the obvious way to solve it isn't always the way that will get you the best result.The game also does a good job at starting you off with the basics and very simple puzzles, slowly introducing you to all the components and concepts required to solving the more difficult puzzles. As much as I loved reading the specs/manuals for TIS-100 and Shenzhen IO this definitely is a more user friendly approach."
119,2498,"If you like Zachtronics games, you'll like this."
120,2498,teaches you the inner workings of a CPU step by step. 10/10 would play agian
121,2498,"If you like logic puzzles, don't hesitate!"
122,2497,"Would you be interested in knowing (and designing) how a microprocessor works, including pipelining and parallel execution? Then this game is for you!It slowly introduces all the concepts you need, so do not worry about that sounding complicated.A labor of love, Definetively reccommended :)"
123,2496,Really cool game about designing a CPU. Reminds a bit on Zachs games.First I thought the game misses one important part but it appeared in the second set of problems. Kind of fun seeing the systems running. Some side missions are actually way harder than the main missions.
124,2496,"A very entertaining puzzle game, especially if you're into logic puzzles. The game strikes a good balance between being a feast of recognition for those familiar with computer logic while at the same time properly explaining every concept to the player (without being condescending) and introducing everything at a pleasant pace. This allows you to always focus on the puzzle at hand, without feeling overwhelmed by the new tools you've just been handed.There are multiple solutions to many of the puzzles and an option to try to achieve a perfect score if you're so inclined. Scores are measured in the number of modules used and in later puzzles also in the time taken to generate the desired output. Sometimes there's a fast solution with few modules, other times however you will need different solutions to achieve fewest modules and best performance separately.The only downside is the background music, it's simplistic and on a very short loop, so it gets monotonous almost instantly. Honestly though that is the only flaw I could find with this game.The graphics look polished and have a nice retro feel to them. And because it's 'just' a puzzle game, it will run on pretty much any system. I've even tried it on a 10 year old laptop with a 2.0 GHz Core2Duo, 4 GB RAM and GeForce 8600M GT and the game ran just fine.After having played the demo I bought the game during the Halloween sale for  13,49 (full price at that time was  14,99). But if it hadn't been on sale I would have bought it as well, it's definitely worth the money!"
125,2495,"Why buy this game?Well, ""game"" is a bit of an odd word for Silicon Zeroes. If I were to describe it, I'd say it's more a series of puzzles, tied together by a loose narrative. The puzzles are based on the workings of computer / electronic hardware. If you're interested in computers from that perspective, of course the game will be of value to you.The puzzles start out easy (""Here's how to connect components!"") but then quickly ramp up in difficulty. For me, this has really been a ""Stare at the problem for a while, leave it alone for a day or two, come back and make some progress, leave it alone again for a day or two"" sort of process. It's a nice to have these little puzzles sitting in the back of your mind, something to ponder on the bus ride or on a coffee break. Then, when you finally solve the problem you get that ""Ah ha!"" moment that's so tremendously enjoyable.Note that you don't have to be a computer genius to enjoy Silicon Zeroes. I've never taken a computer course in my life, and I come from a non-science profession. For me, this game is really a set of logic problems, with the added dimension of time (clicks). Some of the reviews suggest the game helps explain how computer hardware works - if so, fantastic! But rest assured, you can easily approach these problems with a bit of plain old critical thinking and wit.Probably not for impatient audiences. This is not a game of instant gratification. But for the more intellectually inclined, Silicon Zeroes really provides a satisfying, fun experience."
126,2495,Demo available here on Steam or itch.io.Recommended if you like programming and engineering puzzles.
127,2495,"Great puzzle game with some really interesting concepts.  It's challenging, but not brutally so, and the story gives context and meaning to the puzzles without getting in the way.  Highly recommend!"
128,2495,Great Game. Recalling my Computer Science memory at my University time.
129,2494,A must buy if you played TIS-100 and Shenzen I/O.
130,2494,"It's a good game, though not quite up to the Zachtronics standard. There's a lot of fake difficulty in the puzzles. Even more advanced puzzles will make you work without access to key parts that would make the problem trivially easy to solve. Also, it would be nice if you could save multiple solutions to a problem, so you can try different approaches without losing your previous ones that worked. Still, I do recommend it."
131,2494,"An absolute enjoyment of a game to play. To solve the puzzles you need to be able to rethink the problem into smaller chunks, and keep doing that until it becomes something a computer could solve, then put the pieces back together.10/10 (Stay away if you don't like math, because this is pretty much all math)One thing that would be cool would be a freeplay mode, but it doesnt take anything away from the game."
132,2493,"Very thoroughly addictive. A must-play for anyone who is a fan of Zachtronics puzzle games, TIS-100 in particular."
133,2493,Sure beats VHDL.
134,2493,"Silicon Zeroes is like getting smacked in the shoulder with a keisaku stick by some fastidious programming monk; until you reach enlightment in the great challenges of computer organization theory, or leave the retreat in frustration. Meanwhile, some of your fellow attendees are also worried that they accidentally signed up for some sort of 1960's alt-history SJW LARP weekend, but no way are you going to touch that subject with a 10-foot pole. So sit straight, don't relax, and silently fume about how you (yet again) fell short of the clock cycle constraint.(About the play time: I have completed past the first ending and started on the next chapter focused on parallelism, but boy is it whipping me hard. Reminds me why I didn't major in electrical engineering. ^_^;; Also out of impatience, I piped the game's executable through the strings unix utility and read the rest of the plot in plain text. Consider it ""research"" for the plot discussion in this review. @_@;;)To add some context to the top rated reviews, it may be helpful to start with the potential turnoffs:The game is not about building a CPU from low level components, such as NAND gates. Your parts list starts off at a very high level of abstraction (addition is already solved for you), and you don't need to worry about binary math. To its credit, this game covers entirely different ground from the typical NAND2Tetris recommendation.I'm cool with the intentions of the author, but the story is easily the weirdest part of the game. I'm just not sure how much of my consternation was from being already familiar with the real history of Silicon Valley, even though there are some creative, playful ideas in how some underrepresented demographics were represented in the characters (minority fab workers, female programmers, etc). But when contrasted to the actual history, the progressive feel-good story of a bunch of underdogs enduring against all odds was ironically and unintentionally sad. The extra history commentary after you beat the first ending helps explain the author's creative choices, but boy was it kind of wierd working for an alt-history, non-eugenicist, nice version of William Shockley without that narrative context.The common invocation of Zach-likes is warranted, but I think it falls short for 2 reasons:(1) Zachtronics games in my mind are very tolerant of silly and unexpected solutions, while Silicon Zeroes holds you to very strict contraints where the suboptimal solutions are not tolerated. SZ is very puzzlely, and the hand of the designer is felt very heavily for better and worse. For better, the progression of challenges work to test you on insights that you'll need in later levels.  For worse, oh come on, why can't I use parts I know the company has and had let me play with minutes ago???(2) I find the writing in Zachtronics games to be witty and funny, and an incentive to keep pushing through. SZ's plot didn't quite resonate with me in that way. It think part of it is that Zach-like characters, say in Shenzhen I/O or Infinifactory, get the freedom to be cynical, optimistic, fearful, all-business, gross, cosmopolitan, culturally-ignorant, etc, while the majority of characters in SZ seem like... uh, very positive and politically-correct ideals of their respective minority archtypes? To put in another way, there are ""good"" guys in Shenzhen I/O or Infinifactory or Spacechem who may actually be disagreeable to certain players, while it's pretty obnoxiously clear at each step who you should be rooting for/against in Silicon Zeroes.With all that said, I highly recommend Silicon Zeroes for its treatment of the topics involving high-speed and parallelized hardware design. The puzzle-like design of the levels is often annoying, but there are many flashing moments of satori when you find that kernel of understanding the designer had in mind. It's actually kind of clever how you rediscover challenges such as pipelining, caching, and data/control hazards, without some long lecture on those same issues. If you somehow find yourself trying to understand the design tradeoffs inherent in computer organization and design,  SZ is a great active learning introduction to the topic."
135,2492,"Take a Zachtronics game, remove all the fun elements, and add in tons of annoying sexist dialog -- Silicon Zeroes."
136,2492,"Game about designing basic CPUs from basic components such as adders, (de)multiplexers, latches... Starts slow (counters, memory access) and builds up quickly (instructions, clocking, pipelining) Pros:- Pretty rewarding, especially if your solution is more optimal than developer's (yes, it is possible!) - Teaches about principles of CPU design intuitively without mentioning it- Good choices of puzzles, relevant to actual CPU architecture, not just pointless challengesCons:- A bit short, expecting more puzzles to be added in updates- Some lower level components would be nice (e.g. logic gates would be useful in some puzzles)"
137,2492,"TL;DR: Great puzzle game. Extremely fun on its own and happens to teach very real computer science concepts.Summary:Silicon Zeros is a highly accessible story about a tiny Silicon Valley company at the dawn of the computer age, building digital devices and trying to swim rather than sink in the ocean of the tech industry. The plot is funny and relatively compelling, and the gameplay - building digital devices with an easy-to-use, beautiful editor - is tight, interesting, and never too easy nor too hard.The core mechanic is this: Given a restricted set of fundamental digital devices, produce the desired output within the given part and time limit. You can also compare your solutions with those of other players.The game leads you gently between the various challenges, introducing the you to real, useful computer science concepts as you need them to solve puzzles. It is never confusing, though it is often challenging.I absolutely recommend that everyone play this game. The developer is extremely responsive and highly active. I'm a Linux user, and it works great on Linux, after users asked for it to be ported."
138,2492,"This game just keeps getting better and better as new mechanics are introduced.  Developer has done good job adding ease of life features for automating boring parts like automatic trace routing, clock speed calculation, being able to reusabe blocks between levels. The levels have no limitations on board size or part count that allows focusing on creating a  solution that works instead of playing tetris game of squeezing your solution in board. Even though there are little limits levels are still fun and challenging. Main limit is number of cycles but it usually isnt a problem if you do whats asked."
139,2492,"Love this game, if you are in to any game put out by Zachtronics, you will love this game.Pros: Fun gameplay Super satisfying to complete puzzles Nice graphicsCons: Short gameSuper fun game overall. Would definitely recommend."
140,2492,"Silicon Zeroes is a delightful computational puzzle game that made me go back and review the principles of CPU design. Though it never mentions any of them by name, the overarching concept of pipelining, details of hazard avoidance and a number of other very low level concepts are introduced and the player is made to understand them.Though I have some complaints about the puzzles' arbitrary limits (how can I run out of time? Why won't you let me make an inefficient monstrosity?) and a few missing features (sandbox, solution import/export/saving/loading), for the pricetag and the obvious passion that went into the game, I can wholeheartedly recommend this title.Though the story came off as heavy handed to start with, by the final ending, I was genuinely invested in the little illustrated heads that told me what to do in each puzzle."
141,2491,:thumbup:
142,2491,"its a zach like, its not zachtronics and its not the zach killer but is zach worthy10/10 coding games rules"
143,2491,"Solid puzzle game. Good intruduction levels and then expansion of requirements. The 4-star challenges are really difficult. I've solved one of them, but far from efficently. Comunity based scoring to beat other players' min number of objects. Played through ~80% of the puzzles in about 6 hours."
144,2491,"If I didn't know this wasn't made by Zachtronics, I'd probably be willing to bet money that it was. There is a lot in the theme of this game that reminds of the super fulfilling puzzles that Zach had been creating over the years. These type of games, which allow building complex systems through a set of a few simple rules that are quite well defined, are my cup of tea. I also love the mystery of trying out new parts of the system as they are introduced, some defined, some not -- and those that are not, are left for you to discover.The style of puzzles and testing system is quite similar to Zach's game, and those familiar with the ""cram it in the least cycles and least parts as possible challange"" will feel right at home here. The story is kind of meh, though to be fair , while Zach's story telling is much more intriguing than Silicon Zero's, I don't really play these games for the story, IYKWIM.Those with some background with logic components (eg. Latches, Registers, CPUs, ALUs, Muxes, Demuxes, etc), will immediately recognize many of the parts available in the base game. But the best part is -- you don't need to know how these actually work to play!So give the game a go, I think it's quite fun and challenging! Thanks for a great game, guys!"
145,2491,"Too short, but otherwise enjoyable."
146,2491,"I'm coming back to edit this after 2 years, because I was reminded that this game exists, I downloaded it again, it's amazing, and I finally beat the final boss.Look, it's so good. If you are reading this you're probably already into these kinds of games. If so, it's everything you are looking for, just get it. And then play it and tell your friends about it. This game deserves so much more attention than it got."
147,2491,"Gameplay is good but ignore the story, unless you like being told constantly that men are the worst thing ever."
148,2491,"Kind of similar to Zach's games TIS-100 and Shenzen I/O, this is a great puzzle game about CPU design. You should play this."
149,2490,"This game is annoying. It shows you new building blocks, just to then lock them in later levels to artificially make it more difficult for you. This wouldn't be that bad, if it wasn't EVERY LEVEL. This makes it unnecessarily difficult to get a feeling for how things are supposed to work, and results in levels having only one correct answer."
150,2490,I think it's safe to say: I'm addicted. ;)
151,2490,"This game drives me absolutely insane on some levels, which is AMAZING!  It's an excellent play-time simulation of designing digital circuits!"
152,2490,"So I caved in and bought the game 3 hours ago... [mild spoilers?]...And I've already finished the main storyline. Don't get me wrong, some of the challenge puzzles like Multiply, and the bonus chapter at the end, seem pretty fun and challenging, but I bought the game at midnight and half-idly managed to just finish it off now at 2:30 AM. Granted, I do play a LOT of these types of games and some of the puzzles just naturally clicked with me, but the ""main"" part seemed a tad short.The game itself was pretty fun, don't get me wrong! I loved the design and gameplay (Really Shenzhen I/O-esque), and I only really didn't know what I was doing during the start (The input selector was just thrown at you with little to no explanation... and I had no idea what to do at that point. I pretty much guessed my way through it). After that though, the game was a breeze and was an absolute delight to play. I had to get rid of some of my old habits - not being able to connect outputs ""together"" in a T junction was AWFUL, and having some of the modules locked was understandable but a bit... iffy.One thing I really didn't like was how it seemed that a lot of the ""levels"" were tutorials (perfectly fine, nothing wrong with getting people to learn by doing things), or repeats of earlier puzzles with a small amount tacked on (Basic CPU -> Arith CPU, Fast Two -> Delay CPU). This can be done brilliantly where there's a tiny little alteration which makes the whole level different - the first 2 levels of the bonus chapter have really grabbed me because of that! However, a lot of the levels seemed... redundant? I liked the little ones that make you think outside of the box or taught you useful facts like FastCount and Dragging, but besides that, it just felt like a lot of the levels were filler.The story was neat - it wasn't in-depth enough that it detracted from the gameplay, but it got a laugh or two out of me, and the main story ending was pretty nice! A tad predictable but it was still a nice relief. However, beating the game did leave me with a ""Was that it?!"" feeling; just overstepping the 2 hour Steam refund mark was a bad feeling. Fortunately, the bonus chapter gave me a bit of relief that I'd not just paid 10 for a 2 hour long game.Overall, this has been a pretty fun and solid game that I'm hopefully going to be enjoying for a while!"
153,2490,"If you like Zachtronics games, go ahead and buy Silicon Zeroes!If you don't then check out the demo, and see if it's interesting to you. And it if is, buy it, and all the Zachtronics games; you'll love them too. ;)It's a bit shorter, but the experience I had with it was well worth the price imho. Plus I learned a lot about CPU architecture along the way, so that's pretty nice too."
154,2490,The digital logic game you never knew you needed.
155,2490,"Really dope game, challenging and fun."
156,2490,"A great Zachtronics-style game. If you've enjoyed any of those, particularly Shenzhen I/O, you'll almost certainly get something out of this. Many of the puzzles have quite tricky restrictions - how *do* you build a multiplier without using subtract? - and finding a solution that meets the ideal (or better!) is always a fun challenge.The harder puzzles get really hard, but there's plenty to do even if like me you're not at that level. The dev has been active in fixing bugs and adding or tweaking puzzles to make the game more intuitive.+1 would research linear recurrence relations to solve a puzzle again."
157,2490,spacechem but for computer
158,2490,"This is a great little game. It's a LOT like Shenzhen I/O, and by extension, the other Zachtronics games, but that's a good thing.The game tricks you into understanding how CPU's work at the lower levels and makes it interesting, something my Comp. Sci. education never managed to do :)"
159,2490,"Rating it up only because there is no ""meh"" rating.Not bad, but ... it starts off bafflingly simple, repetitious (the tutorial), then it creates difficulty by ommission (i.e. ommitting modules that could help a lot with the solution), and after you venture out of the 'normal' difficutly, it simply gets devilishly hard.   There's pretty much nothing in between, bar one or two labeled ""normal?"" difficulty.For me TIS-100 is the baseline, since it's a very similar game, but this one is not up to that standard.Still, I got a few hrs of thinking out of it, but only the 'normal' difficulty tasks are what I'd call ""fun"" out of this, the easy ones are nothing, the hard ones are just too much messing around trying to figure out that one missing piece."
160,2490,"This was the game I needed today.  A few moments of joy I had so far: Me: ""Cool an input selector, that's totally a mux."" Next Level: ""Yup that was totally a mux""Me: ""I knew it!"" Me: ""Wow I could do this so easily if I had part x and y from a few levels ago""Game: ""Yup, that's why you won't be getting those parts here.  GLHF""Me: ""HAHA, a cunning strategy I will need to create"" Me: ""There got that level in x parts.""Game: ""Cool, We know you can do it better though, Best case is x-1""Me: ""Hmm, how best to make every part count..."" Me: ""As a Zachtronics player always knows: Save your first working solution, then branch off to get betterGame: Sure, you could do that, but I will just autosave the last successful run for you, or you could save it to your clip board.Me:  I have always wanted that Just watching the movement of data I love those little cycles spinning.Will you like this?I dont know.  Its a bit higher level than a game about logic gates, a bit lower than others.  All I know is I like it."
161,2490,"always on the lookout for more games about building smart machines. interesting countdown gimmick, although i've yet to see it fully exploited (still not finished the final page of puzzles). the scoring system is not as developed as in the zachtronics steam games, unfortunately. the dev is still working on polishing, so there may be some improvements. this game is pretty fun, and i'd really like to see what else he can come up with in this vein in the future"
162,2490,"Challenging, but fun if you like logic puzzles and programming style games."
163,2490,"10/10Can be quite challenging, but it's incredibly entertaining."
164,2489,"Seems to be a fun game.Didn't play it for very long but it was fun in the basic levels. But then I realized that you probably have to be smart for that game, that's the moment when I had to give up."
165,2489,Quite a nice game about circuit design. As a side note - developer has some gender-movement-related quirks.
166,2489,"If you like programming puzzle games like TIS-100 and Human Resource Machine, then you'll almost certainly like this. How this one differs is that instead of writing a program in assembler, you are building a machine that will execute assembler. So you are given a program, and a set of test data, and you have to wire together components (adders, registers, selectors, readers, writers, ...) so that the program will run and generate the goal state of the test data. The puzzles start slow as they introduce you to each component, but quickly move on to be much more challenging. And just when you've built your first general purpose CPU and think you've got the hang of things, a whole new timing concept is introduced for the next set of levels providing all new challenges.The drag-drop and plugging together mechanics for building machines is very satisfying. And there's a lot more levels than I originally thought, including a whole set that opens up after you complete the main story. On top of that you can go back and optimize earlier machines for additional replay value."
167,2489,"Great game.  Very challenging.  I would agree with some of the points raised below; some of the more complex modules could do with a short demo to show how they work, but then again, it is also fun just playing with them until you suss it out.I have had the game for about two days, and I have almost completed it now, which does make me think the conent is a bit limited.  Hopefully they will add more content and/or allow community sourced problems to solve.A slight  is that sometimes the AI could be better in terms of not overlapping wiring unless absolutley nessecary, but it's a minor gripe."
168,2489,Absolutley amazing puzzle game!
169,2489,"A solid entry in the ""Zachtronics"" genre of engineering games. Well worth it if you enjoy other engineering puzzle games in this style, like MHRD, TIS-100, ShenzhenIO, etc."
170,2489,"Very cool puzzle game.  If you're  a fan of Zachtronics, then I think you'll find this game very enjoyable.  It's polished, challenging and interesting.  There are basic tutorial type levels and then it's get's pretty tricky.  If you're a fan of Shenzhen then you'll find your self at home with this game."
171,2489,"Very well made.The learning curve is nice and you get a bunch of levels to learn the ropes, then it gets interesting, the puzzles get tougher(in a good way)."
172,2489,1. I like it2. I love it3. I want some more of it
173,2489,"Just a little way in, and starting to hit some more challenging puzzles. Don't get too put off by the difficulty hump when you hit it - the solution is always a little simpler than you realise. It pays to play around!Great job devs!"
174,2489,This game gave me Spacechem-level vibes. Programmer's funbox sandbox game. I'm Hooked.
175,2489,"This is really fun and promising game, it is in the style of Shenzhen I/O but it is by itself a unique and very interesting. I think this will become very popular in the niche of programming/hardware puzzle games."
176,2489,"I've played just under 30 minutes when I wrote this. And this game, this game already has a special place in my heart. I love puzzle games that challenge you and allow you to learn at the same time. I've designed and coded small software and this is exactly that, this is how I see things when I code, working with numbers constantly and it's really really good. I don't want this game to end.I hope that there will be modding capabilities for this, with extended challenges (I can see potential for Objects, Databases, Hacking) if there is not already.9/10 - No game is perfect. But this comes close."

178,2489,"Okay so, I've never played any programming games before and this is all totally new to me. But I decided to give this game a try since it looked kinda fun and had a free demo for me to try out. So I gave the demo a go and found it was actually pretty alright once I understood how each module worked. It's all a matter of figuring out how to organize them to satisfy the objective. Demo hooked me so I bought the game and now I'm slowly making my way through each puzzle, some being harder than others and once in a while the game will introduce new modules. I kinda had to play with some of the modules to figure out how they worked, but once you get it you'll be good to go.  It's also nice how most of the time you have a choice between which puzzle you want to tackle first in case you want to take a break from one and try another. There may be some puzzles you'll have to sit through thinking out how to solve for a while (currently I'm stuck on this one normal puzzle that I can't figure out for the life of me for some reason), but once you finally figure it out it feels so satisfying and you actually learn through the process which will help you solve even harder puzzles. I'd recommend to anyone who likes to challenge themselves or if you just love puzzles in general. If you're unsure on if you'd like it or not, you should definitely give the demo a try!Pros:- lots of fun and challenging puzzles- I'm sure anyone can pick this up and have a good time- progression of difficulty seems pretty good- have a choice for which puzzles to do- Puzzles save your work if you decide to exit out or work on a different puzzle- soundtrack is pretty good and adds to the game- Simple story but adds some context to the puzzlesNeutrals:- could add more hints? that's just my personal preference since sometimes I get stuck for hours on a puzzle and just need a little push in the right direction, but its not nessesary. Cons:- Sometimes the game introduces to you a new module and you don't fully understand how it works until you play around with it- maybe lacks in replayability? Not sure I haven't finished the game but unless something's added like a workshop or mod capability, you'd finish all the puzzles the game has to offer and that would be it"
179,2489,"I was lucky enough to play this game while still in beta, so you'll see I don't have many hours officially logged, but I spent many hours with it. It's an absolutely *incredible* game. If you've played Kerbal Space Program, you'll know what I mean when I say how much more fun it is to play a game where you learn interesting new concepts while you play. This is like the KSP of computers. I'd say it starts a little dry, but stick with it. Once you get to the point where you're beginning to build a working processor, it'll blow your mind.Learned how to build a working computer processor.10/10 would build again."

181,2489,"This game hits the perfect balance of challenge and personality. It deserves more press than what it is getting. The game feels polished (although I wish first time launch was fullscreened). The UI feels natural and is beautiful for a technical indie game. The palette system is excelent, It allows you to save designs for future use. The puzzles, although I've only just started the 'The CPU' blackboard of puzzles, I feel like the mechanics scale well. My bigest complaint of this game is the same complaint I have with most puzzle games, The puzzles are stupid easy then you hit one that blocks your progress because you can't figure it out. This is compounded by the fact that there are no hints (There is a small snipet that you get to help you understand the problem, or things to try but no examples) and no guides / wiki / help doc exists to ease this issue. I think this could be solved by offering a partial solution through the palette system somehow. The characters are more personable than in similar games like Shenzen I/O, the puzzle mechanics feel less restrictive as well. Your not restricted by workbench size or line count, but are restricted by what parts you can use.All in all an excellent game with great character, beautiful UX and difficult challenges well worth the money."

183,2489,I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IM DOING
184,2489,"Poked around for just a day, and I can tell that I'll be comfortable confused for a while!  Already had my fair share of super satisfying ""aha"" moments that are half the appeal of these sorts of logic based games.I have 3 ""boards"" unlocked, plus an asides board, each board filled with puzzles.  Each puzzle is given a star rating system, 1 and 2 stars were for me were generally a breeze, maybe just a bit of poking around to better understand how a new tool works.  3 stars take some doing and a few have stumped me (temporarily, hopefully.  the ""Androids"" level in manufactoria crushed me and my soul and I'm hoping to avoid having to seek outside hints).  The 4 stars look like they'll be lots of fun once I get around to them too.  YMMV with difficulty, I've poked around games like TIS-100, Manufactoria, and Human Resources Machine prior to this and I think some of the skills transfer.Anyway, there's a demo, so go out and try it!  If you like it, you can copy profile0 from the demo folder to the steam folder and avoid repeating levels (Do at your own risk I guess...worked fine for me though)."
185,2489,"Pros:+++ Fun puzzle game about CPU design. I wish we had more of these.+ I really like how they represented signal propagation delay. It's quite approachable and yet actually realistic.Cons:-- Many of the puzzles are artificially constrained in what parts you can use, especially in later levels. Why is subtract so rare? Where are my bitwise operations? Test-if-greater with only add and equals, /really?/- The game should probably have more hints. As an example, register forwarding is an obvious concept for us engineers who've taken an entry-level computer architecture class, but I think most people would have trouble with it. A one or two line ""note"" from Dana for each of the more complex puzzles could help a lot.- The story. Every male character is an offensive stereotype: you've got the A-type sexual-assault-waiting-to-happen, the effeminate-and-ineffectual beta and the eccentric space cadet. It's really heavy handed and obnoxious. How is this better than every female character being a damsel in distress?Neutral:* I wish the wire colors had been picked a little more carefully. It would also be great if the wires were spaced out a little more instead of all following the same paths.Overall:It's an enjoyable puzzle game, though some of the later puzzles dip into the aforementioned why-am-I-wearing-boxing-gloves territory with artificial part constraints. Skip the story."
186,2489,Great Game! I always wanted to learn how to build a CPU. Honestly this game is similar to Kerbal and infinifactory where you really learn somthing from the game. Well done!
