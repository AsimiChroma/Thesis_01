No one is going to learn how to do something that complex instantly, and this game goes gradually enough that anyone can follow along.My only real complaint is when it gets past the first two sets of puzzles, it adds an unnecessary multi-tick element to the clock pulses that makes things ridiculously complicated and not nearly as much fun to solve, not to mention that it's not accurate in terms of real hardware. The firsts sets of puzzles are great, but I got tired of the tedious hoops you have to jump through to build the remainder. There is no reason it couldn't continue without the multi-tick problem.

Many computing games focus on writing code and abstract away the logic that a CPU is actually doing.  If a puzzle game does get into logic operations, its often been oversimplified in order to make it a more accessible game and loses too much of the computing background that they are trying to present.  Silicon Zeroes keeps all of the computing concepts and presents it in a perfectly understandable package.

I have little to no experience in actual electronic design. I mention this on the off-chance this could prejudice my opinion and I have enabled comments for people to call me out on that.I believe when you start any sort of game, be it a shoot'm-up style, an RTS, or a sandbox, you have to know what you're doing with the basics. For example, if you are told to shoot at something, it would be nice to know how to aim and press the trigger on your gun first. You shouldn't be given the gun and then told, ""figure out how to use it"". Let's take an RTS as another example, like Starcraft or Warcraft. You're told what each of the buildings and units do, before being told to take out an enemy base.I mean, c'mon, would you try building a house without knowing how? Foundation? Wiring? Plumbing? Drywall?Silicon Zeros is a good game but it has an absolutely terrible way of getting you started and that ruins it right there. I mean, it started off right with the introduction: I'm a student named Dana who was hired by a startup company in the 1960's to help said company get off the ground. Where it goes off the rails is during my first request to make sure the adders are working. In order to confirm this, I'm told to configure the wiring so the adder output is 2.Okay, first of all, how does one use an adder? Yes, it's obviously an addition unit that formulates a sum but I don't know how to use it. I try right clicking the fields and am told in the hottip text there's nothing there. Well, YES! I can see that! I'm trying to put something IN there! I then click on the nearby tag with the 1 and learn that's a constant output value of 1. I dragged a wire from that tag to one of the two fields and got one of the two values in there so I'm half done...but I need another output .....perhaps another 1 outputter? Sure, but where the hell do I go to get that?I mean, I'm struggling with this like some caveman being asked to make fire with dry twigs.  I'm clicking with all three buttons on my mouse to find a way to change the output of that tag with no success. It was through an accidental dragging of a wire during frantic clicking that I found you can split the wire and connect it to both add fields. Now we have 1 + 1 equaling 2 and the puzzle is solved.Or did I solve it? I mean, the infinite monkey theorem states that a monkey hitting keys at random on a typewriter keyboard for an infinite amount of time will almost surely type any given text, such as the complete works of William Shakespeare. In other words, even the dumbest person with tons of time WILL complete what was asked...but will he or she UNDERSTAND what they did and why? That was not the impression left in me.On to the next puzzle. Two adders, one outputter of 1, wire them to have the final sum add up to 3. All right, what are the rules of wiring these things in serial? How many wires can I attach to each module and where? Again, trial and error to generate some sort of outcome. There's no real planning based on an understanding. I'm trying to drag a wire from one of the first adder's input field to the second adder's upper field but I kept breaking it instead of branching it. I went back to the output field of 1 and was able, again through desperate guessing, to create and drag a third wire OVER the first adder to the second adder's upper field and the sum result of the first adder wired to the lower field of the second adder. Okay, that worked, but what a way to learn!The third puzzle was more of the same guess and go. Try wiring things to get an outcome rather than, you know, explain through examples on how things work. Next puzzle, the configuration one, reveals that the right click functionality of the outputter tag was in fact TURNED OFF in the first puzzle. Yes, apparently my right clicking from the first puzzle was the correct thing to do after all, but because it was disabled, I assumed it was wrong to do that. Now I'm wondering just how much of the full functionality of the game was switched off and as I progressed further, it was a great deal. Apparently you can add more than one number tag outputter after all. There are also other kinds of modules, like subtract and equal that were also hidden, and in some puzzles, hidden at the wrong time when really, they should be available. The Cow puzzle for example could have used the equal module to really simplify things to get the total number of calves born. This guesswork approach of learning is not good for another reason. You're not getting taught the really important things needed for more complex circuit design...like how to create a repeating loop, how long a tick is, how to work with timing in parallel wiring and so forth. These things, much like everything else, is left to guesswork for you to perform. If there was a sandbox to experiment in with all the available parts, I'd be more forgiving. As of this writing, I haven't found one and I'm not sure if the game, unlike others like Opus Magnus and Shenzhen I/O, has one available. It could be unlocked after some progression in the game, but I think that's a mistake to do that.Learning is not guessing, it's imparting knowledge through rote of example. Explain what, how, and why this is so. As I said, this is a really good game but it trips up horribly on the way it introduces people to the game concepts. It should take cues from other circuit design puzzles like Ones and Zeroes (another Steam offering) through a gradual stepped learning curve that builds on the previous lessons taught. If you are patient and willing to put up a lot of aggro trying to learn through this method, perhaps you will get a lot more out of Silicon Zeroes than I did in my initial efforts."

There are exercises in problems solving within the framework of the tools available to you. Many will be reasonably easy to find a solution to, but much harder to optimize (should you even care to). (This is in contrast to usual puzzle games, which are often about guessing the underlying rules the creator made-up so that you can find the one unique solution.)Essentially, engineering types tend to love these kinds of games, and Zilicon Zeroes holds-up in scratching that itch when compared to the mass of entries from Zachtronics."

Lacking a little polish, but great puzzle difficulty and progression.Early levels turned me off slightly, there's less of a sense of each level teaching you something new, making you want to revisit earlier levels to optimize them.  Also, it's lacking a ""solution manager"".  Each puzzle saves its most recent state only.Those minor flaws aside, the puzzles get quite challenging, and I find myself enjoying the game more as difficulty has increased.  Well worth the investment if you enjoyed ShenzenI/O and Exapunks."
684270,69,0,thegrygor,207,1,-1,4.6,"July 6, 2019","This is, to date, the least enjoyable entry in this sub-genre for me, with several major issues that prevent me from actually having a good time with it.First off, the cycle count requirements for completion are excessively strict. The designer has a very specific solution in mind for each puzzle (which is generally an optimal or near-optimal solution), and all but the smallest deviations will be met with failure. In other words, you have to devise a near-optimal solution to most puzzles just to advance, rather than optimization being something you pursue after successful completion - not that optimization is all that interesting either in this game, due to the particular set of metrics solutions are judged on. As a result, there's very little reason to revisit completed puzzles, and you will almost never want to revisit a puzzle because a later puzzle taught you something you could apply to it.Having real-world knowledge of the subject matter is detrimental; many real-life solutions are not workable within the game's constraints, while some puzzles encourage degenerate solutions that would never fly in reality.The pacing is off, with new components frequently being added for a puzzle or two before being removed for many puzzles, before you've had an opportunity to get really comfortable with how they work.Then there are all sorts of minor interface issues. For example, a register file can contain between 1 and 8 registers, and the most generally useful size for a register file is 4 registers, so of course the default size for one is 2 registers.The game maintains an unnecessary separation between edit and sim mode, which is made worse by the fact that in some situations it will switch from one to the other as need, while in others you are required to switch manually.Wires become increasingly indistinct as you add more of them, which is made worse because you can't meaningfully group them into buses, and even when there aren't very many of them they're still not particularly distinct from one another, because they are distinguished only by color, and each wire's color is quite close to the previous wire's.The solution palette is a pain to manage - and you will need to manage it, because it will rarely be clear which sections of which solutions will and will not be useful in the future, and even when they are useful, it's generally for only a small handful of puzzles."

Also the ""back story"" of the start-up engineering firm is cute and retro in a fun way. If it were not for one little detail, I would give it a 5 stars rating, two thumbs up, and recommend it highly to everyone...THE BAD:The commentary in this game is just dripping with overt misandry, sexist comments about men and goes well out of its way to promote the classic Feminist view that women are nothing more than whiny, b*tchy, helpless victims who are more interested in poisoning the work environment than creating a positive culture and inclusive work environment.There's no place for any of that crap in a game.

Quite often you'll be thrown into a puzzle that doesn't use lessons learnt from previous ones and it can be quite difficult to come to grips with what you're supposed to. The clocks and timers don't get the explanation they deserve either.Despite these issues the gameplay itself is well put together - Wiring is easy to disinguish, you aren't constrained by space, the tools are mostly visually distinct, and it feels snappy.Considering it's their first game, I'd be interested to see what lessons they might learn from this, and I'd suggest they take a deeper look at how Zachtronics introduces new concepts and paces the game.For reference, I'm about halfway through the third board."

If you're not familiar with CPU architecture, you may need to do some research on your own. But then again, that can be part of the fun.If anything, my main critisism would be that I wish the game went deeper with some themes like branch prediction or out-of-order execution.

Then you learn something and beat the level and move on to the next level which introduces a new tool or gives you a different type of problem to solve using that same tool.  Later levels then require you to combine the use of different tools to solve more complex problems.  It's a great gameplay loop that will give the player many hours of fun and maybe even teach them something.The problem is that a lot of those early levels don't even exist.  There are these huge cliffs of complexity you have to scale where the game introduces a ton of new concepts and parts which haven't been introduced yet.  Suddenly you're required to build an entire CPU after you learned how to get the adding machine to add 1+1.I really don't understand the advanced concepts introduced in this game, even after looking at the solutions of other people or trying to do some minimum research into the concepts taught in each level.  People will say this game probably isn't for me and I think they would be right about this specific game but wrong about the genre.

It feels like building actual hardware, not like programming pretending to be hardware, so it's much more relaxing. The game doesn't force you to guess the optimal solution right away, and it doesn't force you to deal with low level wiring (which actually makes sense, since it's about wire wrap era, not Shenzhen I/O's PCB era), so it's easy to experiment and try to get something half-working, and then finish or optimize it later.The simulation environment is quite convenient, moving time back and forth, and assembling things is easy. I wish they'd auto-color-code the wires or route them more cleanly - for some puzzles it gets difficult to see what's routed where. Just like with real hardware.On downside it feels like most puzzles have just one ""correct"" solution they had in mind, and you're basically supposed to get it to reach goal. There's achievement for beating the ""goal"" score.There's a bit of variety in mechanics later on - different puzzles have different available components, and some use high resolution clock, while others don't.The game even has OSX version, imagine that. It works better with a 2 button mouse, but it's reasonable with just trackpad and space-clicking things.(there's also some story, but it seemed boring so I ignored it all)"

I'm somewhat disappointed that this may be the last game the dev makes, as it was a fantastic game, much akin to Zachtronics' games. Dev, if you make another game as good as this one, I'll buy it for sure!In terms of an actual review, the gameplay is phenomenal. It's quite difficult in parts, so patience and ingenuinty is definitely required, but I only found a few of the puzzles so confusing that I had to look up solutions. There's a good wealth of solutions and hints to certain puzzles as well, useful for confirming that your thought process is correct. The graphics are nice and slick, but it would be nice if the blackboard screen could ""blow up"" to a nicer resolution. The music can get a bit repetitive, but it's subtle enough that it doesn't intrude into your thinking. Overall I think this is definitely worth the low price of it, if nothing else for the educational benefit you can get out of it.P.S., might be worth having some understanding of ALU's, Parallel Processing and Caches, but that's not necessary, only make it more interesting seeing real life problems manifest themselves naturally in this game."

I've played several games in this genre (zachtronics games and more), but this is the first one I've played that is pure hardware and handles timing well. Most of the games invovling wiring hardware have the concept of calculation ticks (near instant) and state ticks (usually triggered by all chips waiting). But this game gets the division a little bit more realistic which is just enough to add a fun and interesting challenge.Here you have long clock ticks corresponding to state, and then shorter calculation ticks. So not too different from other games on the surface, BUT different chips take different amounts of time to calculate and the clock tick is a variable number of calculation ticks. It feels like setting up a clock pin to be the maximum time for all signals to propagate from one latch to another in a processor (and it basically is!). It's not 100% realistic, but it was a lot of fun and more fufilling than some other games I've played in the past.Highly Recommended :D"

Would recommend to anyone interested in dabbling / learning programming.It's a little harder to pick up - the levels after the end of the game are definitely geared for programmers. It does a very good job at going step by step and introducing concepts slowly, but it doesn't hold your hand at all.It's also a lot more true to real-life than most Zachtronics games. You could actually teach a class using this. And the final prize, if you manage to pull it off, is REALLY impressive.My only complaint is is that the last 3 puzzles after the end of the game are very inconsistent about branch delay slots, and it's never mentioned in the instructions. Perhaps I'm missing something, but the 2nd to last level requires delay slots (and the title hints at it), while in the last level they are an error.It can be hard to find these programming games.

There's only two things I didn't really like about it: 1) it lacks the ability to compare your scores to other players (friends and global) that most other programming games provide, and 2) I feel that the palette feature would've been better if it could've worked more like a function in a traditional programming language and less like a copy/paste feature (I didn't have much interest in returning to older puzzles to improve designs, and I found that I was getting worse scores in later puzzles because I opted to copy/paste designs that included unnecessary features because it was easier than trying to Frankenstein them every step of the way and had no way to refine them across the board like what a reusable function would provide).With that said, it is still a very challenging game that slowly eases you into logic concepts and works its way up to you building an entire CPU. You are still using low-level components provided instead of building them yourself, but as far as concepts go, you can still learn a lot along the way."

684270,3,0,Spartelfant,154,15,1,77.9,"November 2, 2017","A very entertaining puzzle game, especially if you're into logic puzzles. The game strikes a good balance between being a feast of recognition for those familiar with computer logic while at the same time properly explaining every concept to the player (without being condescending) and introducing everything at a pleasant pace. This allows you to always focus on the puzzle at hand, without feeling overwhelmed by the new tools you've just been handed.There are multiple solutions to many of the puzzles and an option to try to achieve a perfect score if you're so inclined. Scores are measured in the number of modules used and in later puzzles also in the time taken to generate the desired output. Sometimes there's a fast solution with few modules, other times however you will need different solutions to achieve fewest modules and best performance separately.The only downside is the background music, it's simplistic and on a very short loop, so it gets monotonous almost instantly. Honestly though that is the only flaw I could find with this game.The graphics look polished and have a nice retro feel to them. And because it's 'just' a puzzle game, it will run on pretty much any system. I've even tried it on a 10 year old laptop with a 2.0 GHz Core2Duo, 4 GB RAM and GeForce 8600M GT and the game ran just fine.After having played the demo I bought the game during the Halloween sale for € 13,49 (full price at that time was € 14,99).

684270,85,1,bnitta,191,4,1,23.1,"October 31, 2017","Why buy this game?Well, ""game"" is a bit of an odd word for Silicon Zeroes. If I were to describe it, I'd say it's more a series of puzzles, tied together by a loose narrative. The puzzles are based on the workings of computer / electronic hardware. If you're interested in computers from that perspective, of course the game will be of value to you.The puzzles start out easy (""Here's how to connect components!"") but then quickly ramp up in difficulty. For me, this has really been a ""Stare at the problem for a while, leave it alone for a day or two, come back and make some progress, leave it alone again for a day or two"" sort of process. It's a nice to have these little puzzles sitting in the back of your mind, something to ponder on the bus ride or on a coffee break. Then, when you finally solve the problem you get that ""Ah ha!"" moment that's so tremendously enjoyable.Note that you don't have to be a computer genius to enjoy Silicon Zeroes. I've never taken a computer course in my life, and I come from a non-science profession. For me, this game is really a set of logic problems, with the added dimension of time (clicks). Some of the reviews suggest the game helps explain how computer hardware works - if so, fantastic! But rest assured, you can easily approach these problems with a bit of plain old critical thinking and wit.Probably not for impatient audiences. This is not a game of instant gratification. But for the more intellectually inclined, Silicon Zeroes really provides a satisfying, fun experience."

Meanwhile, some of your fellow attendees are also worried that they accidentally signed up for some sort of 1960's alt-history SJW LARP weekend, but no way are you going to touch that subject with a 10-foot pole. So sit straight, don't relax, and silently fume about how you (yet again) fell short of the clock cycle constraint.(About the play time: I have completed past the first ending and started on the next chapter focused on parallelism, but boy is it whipping me hard. Reminds me why I didn't major in electrical engineering. ^_^;; Also out of impatience, I piped the game's executable through the strings unix utility and read the rest of the plot in plain text. Consider it ""research"" for the plot discussion in this review. @_@;;)To add some context to the top rated reviews, it may be helpful to start with the potential turnoffs:The game is not about building a CPU from low level components, such as NAND gates. Your parts list starts off at a very high level of abstraction (addition is already solved for you), and you don't need to worry about binary math. To its credit, this game covers entirely different ground from the typical NAND2Tetris recommendation.I'm cool with the intentions of the author, but the story is easily the weirdest part of the game. I'm just not sure how much of my consternation was from being already familiar with the real history of Silicon Valley, even though there are some creative, playful ideas in how some underrepresented demographics were represented in the characters (minority fab workers, female programmers, etc). But when contrasted to the actual history, the progressive feel-good story of a bunch of underdogs enduring against all odds was ironically and unintentionally sad. The extra history commentary after you beat the first ending helps explain the author's creative choices, but boy was it kind of wierd working for an alt-history, non-eugenicist, nice version of William Shockley without that narrative context.The common invocation of Zach-likes is warranted, but I think it falls short for 2 reasons:(1) Zachtronics games in my mind are very tolerant of silly and unexpected solutions, while Silicon Zeroes holds you to very strict contraints where the suboptimal solutions are not tolerated. SZ is very puzzlely, and the hand of the designer is felt very heavily for better and worse. For better, the progression of challenges work to test you on insights that you'll need in later levels.  For worse, oh come on, why can't I use parts I know the company has and had let me play with minutes ago???(2) I find the writing in Zachtronics games to be witty and funny, and an incentive to keep pushing through. SZ's plot didn't quite resonate with me in that way. It think part of it is that Zach-like characters, say in Shenzhen I/O or Infinifactory, get the freedom to be cynical, optimistic, fearful, all-business, gross, cosmopolitan, culturally-ignorant, etc, while the majority of characters in SZ seem like... uh, very positive and politically-correct ideals of their respective minority archtypes? To put in another way, there are ""good"" guys in Shenzhen I/O or Infinifactory or Spacechem who may actually be disagreeable to certain players, while it's pretty obnoxiously clear at each step who you should be rooting for/against in Silicon Zeroes.With all that said, I highly recommend Silicon Zeroes for its treatment of the topics involving high-speed and parallelized hardware design. The puzzle-like design of the levels is often annoying, but there are many flashing moments of satori when you find that kernel of understanding the designer had in mind. It's actually kind of clever how you rediscover challenges such as pipelining, caching, and data/control hazards, without some long lecture on those same issues. If you somehow find yourself trying to understand the design tradeoffs inherent in computer organization and design,  SZ is a great active learning introduction to the topic."

The plot is funny and relatively compelling, and the gameplay - building digital devices with an easy-to-use, beautiful editor - is tight, interesting, and never too easy nor too hard.The core mechanic is this: Given a restricted set of fundamental digital devices, produce the desired output within the given part and time limit. You can also compare your solutions with those of other players.The game leads you gently between the various challenges, introducing the you to real, useful computer science concepts as you need them to solve puzzles.

There is a lot in the theme of this game that reminds of the super fulfilling puzzles that Zach had been creating over the years. These type of games, which allow building complex systems through a set of a few simple rules that are quite well defined, are my cup of tea. I also love the mystery of trying out new parts of the system as they are introduced, some defined, some not -- and those that are not, are left for you to discover.The style of puzzles and testing system is quite similar to Zach's game, and those familiar with the ""cram it in the least cycles and least parts as possible challange"" will feel right at home here.

Don't get me wrong, some of the challenge puzzles like Multiply, and the bonus chapter at the end, seem pretty fun and challenging, but I bought the game at midnight and half-idly managed to just finish it off now at 2:30 AM. Granted, I do play a LOT of these types of games and some of the puzzles just naturally clicked with me, but the ""main"" part seemed a tad short.The game itself was pretty fun, don't get me wrong! I loved the design and gameplay (Really Shenzhen I/O-esque), and I only really didn't know what I was doing during the start (The input selector was just thrown at you with little to no explanation... and I had no idea what to do at that point. I pretty much guessed my way through it). After that though, the game was a breeze and was an absolute delight to play. I had to get rid of some of my old habits - not being able to connect outputs ""together"" in a T junction was AWFUL, and having some of the modules locked was understandable but a bit... iffy.One thing I really didn't like was how it seemed that a lot of the ""levels"" were tutorials (perfectly fine, nothing wrong with getting people to learn by doing things), or repeats of earlier puzzles with a small amount tacked on (Basic CPU -> Arith CPU, Fast Two -> Delay CPU). This can be done brilliantly where there's a tiny little alteration which makes the whole level different - the first 2 levels of the bonus chapter have really grabbed me because of that! However, a lot of the levels seemed... redundant? I liked the little ones that make you think outside of the box or taught you useful facts like FastCount and Dragging, but besides that, it just felt like a lot of the levels were filler.The story was neat - it wasn't in-depth enough that it detracted from the gameplay, but it got a laugh or two out of me, and the main story ending was pretty nice! A tad predictable but it was still a nice relief. However, beating the game did leave me with a ""Was that it?!"" feeling; just overstepping the 2 hour Steam refund mark was a bad feeling.

684270,8,0,amchap,51,5,1,23.3,"September 20, 2017","If you like programming puzzle games like TIS-100 and Human Resource Machine, then you'll almost certainly like this. How this one differs is that instead of writing a program in assembler, you are building a machine that will execute assembler. So you are given a program, and a set of test data, and you have to wire together components (adders, registers, selectors, readers, writers, ...) so that the program will run and generate the goal state of the test data. The puzzles start slow as they introduce you to each component, but quickly move on to be much more challenging. And just when you've built your first general purpose CPU and think you've got the hang of things, a whole new timing concept is introduced for the next set of levels providing all new challenges.The drag-drop and plugging together mechanics for building machines is very satisfying. And there's a lot more levels than I originally thought, including a whole set that opens up after you complete the main story. On top of that you can go back and optimize earlier machines for additional replay value."

I would agree with some of the points raised below; some of the more complex modules could do with a short demo to show how they work, but then again, it is also fun just playing with them until you suss it out.I have had the game for about two days, and I have almost completed it now, which does make me think the conent is a bit limited.  Hopefully they will add more content and/or allow community sourced problems to solve.A slight ♥♥♥♥♥♥ is that sometimes the AI could be better in terms of not overlapping wiring unless absolutley nessecary, but it's a minor gripe."

684270,1,0,76561197978638448,253,17,1,11.9,"September 18, 2017","Pros:+++ Fun puzzle game about CPU design. I wish we had more of these.+ I really like how they represented signal propagation delay. It's quite approachable and yet actually realistic.Cons:-- Many of the puzzles are artificially constrained in what parts you can use, especially in later levels. Why is subtract so rare? Where are my bitwise operations? Test-if-greater with only add and equals, /really?/- The game should probably have more hints. As an example, register forwarding is an obvious concept for us engineers who've taken an entry-level computer architecture class, but I think most people would have trouble with it. A one or two line ""note"" from Dana for each of the more complex puzzles could help a lot.- The story. Every male character is an offensive stereotype: you've got the A-type sexual-assault-waiting-to-happen, the effeminate-and-ineffectual beta and the eccentric space cadet. It's really heavy handed and obnoxious. How is this better than every female character being a damsel in distress?Neutral:* I wish the wire colors had been picked a little more carefully. It would also be great if the wires were spaced out a little more instead of all following the same paths.Overall:It's an enjoyable puzzle game, though some of the later puzzles dip into the aforementioned why-am-I-wearing-boxing-gloves territory with artificial part constraints. Skip the story."
684270,2,1,devcon42,388,5,1,8.7,"September 18, 2017","This game hits the perfect balance of challenge and personality. It deserves more press than what it is getting. The game feels polished (although I wish first time launch was fullscreened). The UI feels natural and is beautiful for a technical indie game. The palette system is excelent, It allows you to save designs for future use. The puzzles, although I've only just started the 'The CPU' blackboard of puzzles, I feel like the mechanics scale well. My bigest complaint of this game is the same complaint I have with most puzzle games, The puzzles are stupid easy then you hit one that blocks your progress because you can't figure it out. This is compounded by the fact that there are no hints (There is a small snipet that you get to help you understand the problem, or things to try but no examples) and no guides / wiki / help doc exists to ease this issue. I think this could be solved by offering a partial solution through the palette system somehow. The characters are more personable than in similar games like Shenzen I/O, the puzzle mechanics feel less restrictive as well. Your not restricted by workbench size or line count, but are restricted by what parts you can use.All in all an excellent game with great character, beautiful UX and difficult challenges well worth the money."

Already had my fair share of super satisfying ""aha"" moments that are half the appeal of these sorts of logic based games.I have 3 ""boards"" unlocked, plus an asides board, each board filled with puzzles.  Each puzzle is given a star rating system, 1 and 2 stars were for me were generally a breeze, maybe just a bit of poking around to better understand how a new tool works.  3 stars take some doing and a few have stumped me (temporarily, hopefully.  the ""Androids"" level in manufactoria crushed me and my soul and I'm hoping to avoid having to seek outside hints).  The 4 stars look like they'll be lots of fun once I get around to them too.  YMMV with difficulty, I've poked around games like TIS-100, Manufactoria, and Human Resources Machine prior to this and I think some of the skills transfer.Anyway, there's a demo, so go out and try it!  If you like it, you can copy profile0 from the demo folder to the steam folder and avoid repeating levels (Do at your own risk I guess...worked fine for me though)."

But I decided to give this game a try since it looked kinda fun and had a free demo for me to try out. So I gave the demo a go and found it was actually pretty alright once I understood how each module worked. It's all a matter of figuring out how to organize them to satisfy the objective. Demo hooked me so I bought the game and now I'm slowly making my way through each puzzle, some being harder than others and once in a while the game will introduce new modules. I kinda had to play with some of the modules to figure out how they worked, but once you get it you'll be good to go.  It's also nice how most of the time you have a choice between which puzzle you want to tackle first in case you want to take a break from one and try another. There may be some puzzles you'll have to sit through thinking out how to solve for a while (currently I'm stuck on this one normal puzzle that I can't figure out for the life of me for some reason), but once you finally figure it out it feels so satisfying and you actually learn through the process which will help you solve even harder puzzles. I'd recommend to anyone who likes to challenge themselves or if you just love puzzles in general. If you're unsure on if you'd like it or not, you should definitely give the demo a try!Pros:- lots of fun and challenging puzzles- I'm sure anyone can pick this up and have a good time- progression of difficulty seems pretty good- have a choice for which puzzles to do- Puzzles save your work if you decide to exit out or work on a different puzzle- soundtrack is pretty good and adds to the game- Simple story but adds some context to the puzzlesNeutrals:- could add more hints? that's just my personal preference since sometimes I get stuck for hours on a puzzle and just need a little push in the right direction, but its not nessesary. Cons:- Sometimes the game introduces to you a new module and you don't fully understand how it works until you play around with it- maybe lacks in replayability?
