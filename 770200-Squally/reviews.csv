But I kind of expected that coming from a developer background.But today, I didn't feel like playing any fast paced games like first person shooters and decided to dig up some old ""actually think"" games I bought a while ago. Squally being one of them.After giving Squally a serious try, I absolutely love the charm and aesthetic it brings. The calming music, the fun minigames (like the gwent style card game), The interesting rooms to explore, the neat features involved around working with low level computer science. It's all fantastic and you can tell the author or team behind this genuinely put love in the game. It brings me back to the nostalgic kid playing flash games that were just interesting and fun in their own unique way.Truly, thank you.

Some are writing this game off as not very informative, it teaches you in a very unconventional way which is to actually do things related to assembly as opposed to droning on about it in a hour long section in a part of youtube with maybe a few thousand views and an accent you can barely understand. With Squally, I had so much fun, I forgot I was programming. The very reason you should buy Squally is because it teaches you through repetition and actual work as opposed to just giving a lecture. It's fun and I found myself eager to get to the next section of enemies to learn some new thing about assembly language. Hexus makes for a fun little distraction that despite being seemingly pointless is very important, it familiarizes you with opcodes and tasks related to them. All opcodes can be found in your standard x86_64 assembly book that's available for free from intel's site. Squally covers a majority of opcodes in a fun and addictive way. The battles feel like paper mario, but instead, you're hackerman and basically God. The game really deceives you into thinking you're not learning but you actually are. There are a few bugs to be aware of, the game despite being centered around hacking, makes the first cardinal sin of coding which is to assume the user's input. Many things can be input when using squally's ability to hack, therefore things can go horrendously wrong which to average computer illiterate users can be frustrating. There needs to be messages that explicitly state things that the developers might consider common sense but to the newbie won't be so obvious. All-in-all Squally is a buy for the up and coming comp sci student or anyone interested in comp sci who wants a better understanding of the lowest level computer language, which is x86_64 assembly. It gets you to just do things, and no matter how many books you read, doing will always lend more experience, than reading ever will. Squally manages to make doing assembly, feel like you're just playing a fun RPG. Give it a shot and I hope you enjoy."
770200,4,0,wolfleaderawesome,75,11,1,5.6,"October 2, 2020","My thoughts on the game:The hacking Tutorials are good to learn the basics of memory editing, hex editing and pointers, especially when following Zac's tutorials on GH as he explains it quite thoroughly. however, I do wish there were more challenges to complete for each section and definitely some harder ones as well. (However, I do understand that it is in Beta)The story mode is all about editing simple Assembly code and Hexus is the card game about learning how to count on hexadecimal and binary. I found Hexus extremely useful and it solidified my binary counting skills, however, my Hexadecimal still need some work! The Assembly code editor is a cool concept, however, I do think it could be expanded on to include more game entities to ""hack"" and maybe having to learn some more advanced stuff.TLDR: Besides a maybe adding some more challenges the game is awesome and helps teach the basics of game hacking"

My favorite part is the combat and how there are so many ways to solve a single problem. I remember one time there was a super obvious solution to a problem but there was a more complicated way to do it allowing for me to oneshot all of the enemies which was super satisfying for the extra work I put in. I wasn't a huge fan of the card game hexus but luckily you don't need to do that to progress in the story. All in all it was fun and I feel like a learned a lot.

It has what appears to be basic vector art, which is forgivable since it's meant to be a guided lesson. Which it can't accomplish and doesn't do, yet. Somehow as a 2D game it even manages to lose frames on a PC that can run Red Dead Redemption 2 on high settings at a steady 60 fps. Somebody needs to look at their rendering pipeline.It doesn't appear to even have music yet. I bought this barely functional pile of assets, messily slapped together that is neither functional or punctual to support it's developers in a new tutorial series they're making on Youtube. If you aren't feeling generous and charitable to developers who may or may not take your money and run for the possibility of a game that may or may not be completed for a video series that also may or may not be completed. Do not buy this ""game"". Otherwise, buy it and let it slowly develop in your Steam library hoping it has something to teach you in a couple years.I've written code for a long time, it's one of my only passions. This passion branched off into reverse engineering and I'm already familiar with assembly, but always consider myself a student. I like reading and watching tutorials to see if someone else caught something I missed. I don't need this game to teach me, but I like the concept and hope it is completed to help others.Maybe I could refer a friend to it in the future as an easier introduction than I had. That's why I'm willing to buy this and not refund it for being something I feel I could write better in a week, including writing the engine itself from scratch and using my own ♥♥♥♥, hand-drawn assets and sound effects recorded with my microphone.Too long didn't read: If you're in the market for a game that teaches you how to reverse engineer it or even a playable game.

As a developer proficient in many languages, including assembly, this game probably isn't worth recommending to the least knowledgeable potential programmers. It lacks depth, it lacks explanation, and most, if not all the knowledge gained from this game is not usable without heavy background knowledge.The the implementation of education makes people think that editing a routine / changing a game's function is as simple as changing register values, or adding variable amounts of code to get the desired effect, when in practice is almost never the case - never mind wanting persistence or a more permanent effect.This game is in early development, and I have had high hopes for when it was first announced to use this as a supplement to reverse engineering, but sadly at this point, this is still a waste of people's time and more importantly, if their goal is to truly to learn reverse engineering of games, doesn't do service to those optimistic to learn.I am still hopeful, and am willing to change the review as time tells.
