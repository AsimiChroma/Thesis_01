Does absolutely need work, but that's what you are buying when you buy early access."],["Game have a lotttt of potential ... in about 1hour of Hexus ive been able to calculate binary value in my head cant wait to see the finish product, story line and such... I can only hope it will be close to Hack N Slash ( another game that introduce variable .. ) but for real this time.. would pay again ... in a blink just to get my hand on the complete finished product !on windows I have a lot of issue but its clearly in link with my driver ( the game use opengl ) and my card is limited to opengl 4.4 somehow ... and the new driver are 4.5 had to downgrade and do a lot of debugon linux, lol it run first shot !"],["It's still early access but it already looks interesting, the first look at the story mode looks awesome, hope to see the rest of the campaign soon.A bit of rough edges like in the pointers mini-game, where the holes sometimes render like transparent squares, hard to look at, but definitely playable if you realize you shouldn't  touch the missing parts."],["The game is extremely unstable, it crashes for no reason.Crashes even when I am trying to starting the game.It crashes for almost everything, I have wasted my money over this game.Will not recommend this at this stage, this seems like a good concept though there are more bugs than features, unless the author of the game want us to debug the whole game and handle all those unhandled exceptions to make this thing run properly."],["current price gets you demo purchase if you want to support game."],["Played a little bit, its fun, but definitely not for learning. You can't learn hacking in this game. It just lacks the real world examples and it is so bare bones. A lot need to be added\/changed for it to be good for learning.If you wan't something to goof around with, sure go for it.But if you plan on buying for learning, stop its not worth it. The price is too high for a \"learning\" game. If the game actually learned you how to hack, the price would be solid."],["The idea of the game and implementation are on such different levels.Of course, when one visualized a product, one probably leaps the line a bit, and squally is no exception. As a developer proficient in many languages, including assembly, this game probably isn't worth recommending to the least knowledgeable potential programmers. It lacks depth, it lacks explanation, and most, if not all the knowledge gained from this game is not usable without heavy background knowledge.The the implementation of education makes people think that editing a routine \/ changing a game's function is as simple as changing register values, or adding variable amounts of code to get the desired effect, when in practice is almost never the case - never mind wanting persistence or a more permanent effect.This game is in early development, and I have had high hopes for when it was first announced to use this as a supplement to reverse engineering, but sadly at this point, this is still a waste of people's time and more importantly, if their goal is to truly to learn reverse engineering of games, doesn't do service to those optimistic to learn.I am still hopeful, and am willing to change the review as time tells. Until then, good luck."],["Not a game yet, it's in very early access. It might give you a hint, when it doesn't encounter a bug; Because it's a barely started game. It has what appears to be basic vector art, which is forgivable since it's meant to be a guided lesson. Which it can't accomplish and doesn't do, yet. Somehow as a 2D game it even manages to lose frames on a PC that can run Red Dead Redemption 2 on high settings at a steady 60 fps. Somebody needs to look at their rendering pipeline.It doesn't appear to even have music yet. I bought this barely functional pile of assets, messily slapped together that is neither functional or punctual to support it's developers in a new tutorial series they're making on Youtube. If you aren't feeling generous and charitable to developers who may or may not take your money and run for the possibility of a game that may or may not be completed for a video series that also may or may not be completed. Do not buy this \"game\". Otherwise, buy it and let it slowly develop in your Steam library hoping it has something to teach you in a couple years.I've written code for a long time, it's one of my only passions. This passion branched off into reverse engineering and I'm already familiar with assembly, but always consider myself a student. I like reading and watching tutorials to see if someone else caught something I missed. I don't need this game to teach me, but I like the concept and hope it is completed to help others.Maybe I could refer a friend to it in the future as an easier introduction than I had. That's why I'm willing to buy this and not refund it for being something I feel I could write better in a week, including writing the engine itself from scratch and using my own , hand-drawn assets and sound effects recorded with my microphone.Too long didn't read: If you're in the market for a game that teaches you how to reverse engineer it or even a playable game. This is not for you, yet. If you want to invest in something that may become that in an unknown time span in the future. Feel free to invest in these developers like I have.I will change this review in the future if the developers update the game.","Finished the early access content thus far (right before limestone boss) definitely a little rough around the edges. I'd prefer the game to be more instructive than fun. I found the travel time to be too slow for someone trying to play the parts where they'll learn. The TAB 3 use limit should be removed, found myself stuck at the first trap because I'd spam TAB and no audio\/warning that I'm out of charges. Can't wait for the full release","Great game, its the first of its kind that I have seen on steam. I have a few suggestions and bugs though.S = SuggestionB = BugS1. Add more assembly modification parts, there was not enough in the first part.S2. If you see the video by GuidedHacking he shows all sorts of things he plans to do in his series, I would like to see things other than assembly modification like those in his videos.B1. A lot of times in game after the first village I get a lot of random characters in the dialog and they may even replace the words itself.Besides those, I hope y'all keep developing this game! It has great potential!"],["It would be a good game if it worked the thing is when you get to the castle and you enter it, it crashes and then you try to open it and it crashes the game again. another problem is it randomly crashes and it gets annoying. until these bugs are fixed I would not recommend playing it."],["I wish I was able to play the minigames separately again. Waiting for the main story updates takes quite a while."],["It is pretty fun. Can be explained a lot better in my opinion.  Looking forward for updates!"],["I wouldn't recommend it as of now, the gameplay lacks tutorials, navigation around the map is slow and boring.No BG music! The mini game is quite good though."],["i recently bought this to check it out cause it looked interesting. If you are new to hacking and would like to learn then yes this game is great! Unfortunately for me i already knew most of the stuff they were trying to teach in the game therefore it did not help me! But like i said its great if you are new, In fact when i got into game hacking i wish this game was around!Overall i would say its a 5\/5 stars for newbies but wouldnt recommend if you already have experience"],["The game is poorly made, gives the impression of a slightly enhanced platformer game template. The gameplay looks raw, there are some small bugs, languages are literally google translated, and I'm getting less fps than in minecraft on my Windows 8.1 8GB RAM laptop."],["Even though this game is still in early access, i've thoroughly enjoyed the game!I started this game knowing nothing about assembly language, and now I can confidently say I know how to read and understand operations to some extent! Good thing is, because it's learnt through playing.. I can remember things better..The mini game Hexus was also very fun, and refreshed my memory about binaries and hexes!I definitely recommend this game to anyone looking to learn assembly language and binaries \/ hexadecimal calculations!"],["Haven't finished the game yet but so far its quite enjoyable! As an aspiring game hacker, squally as well as other tutorials made by the same Developer have taught me some new things while keeping me entertained playing through the story mode. It is an early access game but with that said it is going in the right direction. If you plan on picking this up just as a game to play then go for it! If you plan on picking this up to learn game hacking then I recommend you follow along with the Developers CS420 tutorials while playing through the game. Overall it's a fun game that anybody can beat!"],["Good and interesting game with verry helpful content, one advice to everyone who wants to learn the hacking... first finish the game story and then start with Cheat Engine, after that u can continue with IDA Pro and x64dbg and etc. This game is not waste of time for sure. Oh, one more thing... look for tutorials in GuidedHacking, u can find very helpful tutorials there too, also if u are lazy to read, code and etc. dont waste your time with this things, its just not for you :)"],["Pretty cool, tho its too easy if you know how to program already :\/I hope in the end game there would be some really hard puzzles.Really good game if you are just starting with stuff like this, so i fully recommend it",null,"Starts off REALLY slow but gets interesting. While it probably wasn't needed, I constantly had to research a lot of the assembly I was using to get an understanding of what I was doing, which I was fine with. Good game. Cant wait for more levels.","This game is a super fun way to learn assembly. I would much rather play this than watch boring youtube videos! My favorite part is the combat and how there are so many ways to solve a single problem. I remember one time there was a super obvious solution to a problem but there was a more complicated way to do it allowing for me to oneshot all of the enemies which was super satisfying for the extra work I put in. I wasn't a huge fan of the card game hexus but luckily you don't need to do that to progress in the story. All in all it was fun and I feel like a learned a lot. I would seriously recommend it if your interested in learning this kind of stuff."],["I got addicted to the hex card game, honestly. xDDD. It's a fun little game."],["My thoughts on the game:The hacking Tutorials are good to learn the basics of memory editing, hex editing and pointers, especially when following Zac's tutorials on GH as he explains it quite thoroughly. however, I do wish there were more challenges to complete for each section and definitely some harder ones as well. (However, I do understand that it is in Beta)The story mode is all about editing simple Assembly code and Hexus is the card game about learning how to count on hexadecimal and binary. I found Hexus extremely useful and it solidified my binary counting skills, however, my Hexadecimal still need some work! The Assembly code editor is a cool concept, however, I do think it could be expanded on to include more game entities to \"hack\" and maybe having to learn some more advanced stuff.TLDR: Besides a maybe adding some more challenges the game is awesome and helps teach the basics of game hacking"],["Squally has a lot of promise despite being in a very early stage. Some are writing this game off as not very informative, it teaches you in a very unconventional way which is to actually do things related to assembly as opposed to droning on about it in a hour long section in a part of youtube with maybe a few thousand views and an accent you can barely understand. With Squally, I had so much fun, I forgot I was programming. The very reason you should buy Squally is because it teaches you through repetition and actual work as opposed to just giving a lecture. It's fun and I found myself eager to get to the next section of enemies to learn some new thing about assembly language. Hexus makes for a fun little distraction that despite being seemingly pointless is very important, it familiarizes you with opcodes and tasks related to them. All opcodes can be found in your standard x86_64 assembly book that's available for free from intel's site. Squally covers a majority of opcodes in a fun and addictive way. The battles feel like paper mario, but instead, you're hackerman and basically God. The game really deceives you into thinking you're not learning but you actually are. There are a few bugs to be aware of, the game despite being centered around hacking, makes the first cardinal sin of coding which is to assume the user's input. Many things can be input when using squally's ability to hack, therefore things can go horrendously wrong which to average computer illiterate users can be frustrating. There needs to be messages that explicitly state things that the developers might consider common sense but to the newbie won't be so obvious. All-in-all Squally is a buy for the up and coming comp sci student or anyone interested in comp sci who wants a better understanding of the lowest level computer language, which is x86_64 assembly. It gets you to just do things, and no matter how many books you read, doing will always lend more experience, than reading ever will. Squally manages to make doing assembly, feel like you're just playing a fun RPG. Give it a shot and I hope you enjoy."],["This is a great game if you`d like to learn about game hacking and stuff like that , it`s made really nice and has a great game experience !"],["Good Game for learning hacking skils"],["i like gamei recommend gamethis game goodthis game teach a lotme tired, low effort reviewwill update later"],["A definite YES! On second though, don't buy it, the game is broken en there is no support."],["Unique and fun"],["There could be a bug in the game, I have reported for them in their Discord server. But, they are not answering at all. After several days of waiting, I have to rate the game negative."],["At first, I thought the game was boring to be honest, rather slow start. But I kind of expected that coming from a developer background.But today, I didn't feel like playing any fast paced games like first person shooters and decided to dig up some old \"actually think\" games I bought a while ago. Squally being one of them.After giving Squally a serious try, I absolutely love the charm and aesthetic it brings. The calming music, the fun minigames (like the gwent style card game), The interesting rooms to explore, the neat features involved around working with low level computer science. It's all fantastic and you can tell the author or team behind this genuinely put love in the game. It brings me back to the nostalgic kid playing flash games that were just interesting and fun in their own unique way.Truly, thank you. I got 47 minutes now and plan on adding a couple more hours today"],["good game but the mana system is underused really and would be good to touch more on making godmode team specific in hacking tuts"],["It's a good game"],["Sooo... Acctually a great game not even jokingThis game learns you assembly really wellSadly this game is probably only 1\/4 | 1\/3 finished Im waiting for more awesome content"],["Great game for learning how assembly works at a super basic level. People often think this game is gonna make them a pro-haxxor when really its just an intro. Once you beat the game and do the haxing tutorials, then its in your hands to further your knowledge.","Keep it up. Games like this are worth every penny."],["Great game for learning Assembly. It's actually very fun and has a great learning curve. Starts out right at the level of a layperson. Some of the concepts could bear greater explaining, but in the context of the game it tries to keep things fresh. Definitely doesn't detract from the learning experience. I also like the inclusion of the Lexicon and tutorials as nice bonuses."],["As a hacker who's full-time job is web application penetration testing and cloud security engineering, I rarely have time or the desire to learn more assembly or C++.  This game is a really good way to refresh your memory and learn the basics."]]}
