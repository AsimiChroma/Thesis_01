0,2704,Nice for programmers and people who want to begin with programming.
1,2704,"You kknow how at work you get an interesting programming task, which you quickly mash out and then you spend the rest of your time fixing weird bugs?This is that, but cute, so it's fun."
2,2703,Great way to get the creative juices flowing.  Great way to relax and unwind after work.
3,2702,there are less than 7 billion humans in the game
4,2701,"Programming puzzles, love'em!!!"

6,2700,"this is a fantastic game - fun, challenging, and very satisfying."
7,2697,"7 Billion Humans is a much improved sequel to Human Resources Machine, and I'd say one of the better casual programming puzzle games out there. In most puzzle games, there's one predetermined solution, and the tasks are made in a way that would make it impossible to come up with any other approach. This game is not like that - it gives you a set of tools, and you solve the problem as you see fit, no pressure in how you do that - and this is close to an ideal puzzle game for me. And you're not getting lost in this freedom, it is apparent which tools you need to use to reach the goal. You might need to implement a certain solution if you're trying to complete optional tasks, but this is up to you, there's no unlocks besides achievements for doing so.Pretty much all the gripes I had with HRM are fixed in this game - it is longer (it took me around 10 hours to finish the game without optional challenges), it uses more high-level commands so programming does not feel like a chore, the tasks are purposeful and visually comprehensible.I have a few nitpicks though:1) Some mechanics are underutilized, like buttons, sensors and displays in the last few levels. Also, some tasks do not let you use certain commands, which is a shame. Kinda asks for level editor, eh?2) When optimizing a program for execution speed, I wish there was a profiler of sorts to see how long each line takes, or at least a clear way to see a command execution time, without manually checking it with a timer.3) I wish there was an explanation for certain nuances of commands. For example, I was avoiding combining ANDs and ORs in conditionals because it is not explained how they are grouped.  The directional checks are also quite nondeterministic in how they happen in a dynamic environments, like when a box you just checked gets picked up before you can do anything about it, and I get it that multithreading is naturally undeterministic, but sometimes I had to manually tweak the solution around that, hoping that it'll stickTL;DR A nice puzzle game about programming, don't look at big words I randomly threw about, it is really not that hard, try it out"
8,2694,"Cute, not too difficult, and all around good fun . You'll probably know if this is something for you or not. Just wish I could type but the indentation is already a huge step-up."
9,2692,Hilariously fun way to learn basic programming logic! I love this game ^D^/
10,2691,"Going into this game with basically no prior coding knowledge, it was fun and educational while also making me feel smooth-brained. I made it through about a third of the puzzles before my noggin couldn't take it anymore.Bonus points for the story line being cute and entertaining."
11,2690,Probably the silliest programming logic game i have played and provided many laughs on how those office workers are treated.  If you've been looking to play a logic game that doesn't have the serious tone that most of them do this is a good choice for that.If your looking for a chill stream that doesn't stick to one game check me out at https://www.twitch.tv/justthepassenger !
12,2689,"Once again, a great creation from the Tomorrow Corporation. I loved the Human Resource Machine and this is just a great sequel for it."
13,2689,great game with  puzzles [u/]
14,2689,Pretty good and difficult game that has taught me my college degree in Programming is actually total garbage.
15,2688,"A cute, fun, coding puzzle game. I got stumped by one of the concepts, but the game let me skip it, so I still got to reach the end. ;D"
16,2688,Yes
17,2688,Its a relex game after long day of programming.
18,2687,"Great game, if you like programming definitely get this one."
19,2687,theres a reason i havent played this in 2 years
20,2687,Very amusing and satisfying when your program works. Quite a cerebral challenge that I like!
21,2687,Fun casual programming that get's challenging in the latest stages and when optimizing. It's not really aimed at people experienced with programming as the programming aspect itself is pretty basic (drag and drop) and doesn't allow for any QoL features. I already recommended Human Resource Machine and this one is just as fun.
22,2686,Fun and with very nice mechanics.
23,2686,"7 Billion Humans, like its predecessor Human Resource Machine, is a great game. It has a good tutorial. It is short but also cheap. It does a good job teaching programming basics using a GUI block-style system. It also has pretty interesting and cynical commentary on corporations, which I love. I heartily recommend this game.However as a programmer of many years I have 1 major issue with this game. Like every programming game I've played so far, It uses a style of programming which becomes very tedious as the challenges get more complicated. It becomes nearly impossible to logically reason your way through the challenges... you must resort to trial and error. Early in my career I tried to get away from doing programming because most learning materials modeled programming this way. It is a horrendously boring way to solve problems. 7 Billion Humans triggered that same feeling in me and I stopped playing it at that point. I did complete HR Machine to finish the story but for the last handful of levels I looked up solutions. Because it just wasn't fun.My suggestion to the game devs is this: introduce functions in later levels of the game. This one feature would bring the game back from mostly trial and error in latter levels to something more fun and manageable. And like in real programming it provides a sense of progression. You could save solutions from previous challenges as functions to easily reuse them in later levels. You'd additionally have all my respect if you went to functional instead of imperative programming. But you would have to come up with much more complicated puzzles because the game as is would be far too easy.Great game, cheap, must buy. If you are interested in programming, don't let the advanced levels of the game turn you off to it."
24,2686,It's great. Fun and I learned something about programming here.
25,2686,You know what? coding as a game is cool. you should get this.
26,2686,"Nice one to relax, pretty engaging, challenges are well-done. Solid 8.5/10"
27,2685,"The most interesting game in a year! My only wish: Please add Steam Workshop! I would love my son to be able to write his own functions, commands and levels."
28,2684,"Rating:7/10Completion difficulty: 1/10Welcome (again) to the wonderful world of programming! This game goes a little further compared to human resource marchine: instead of just doing basic programming, you will do things that computers execute every day! Defragmenting, for instance. This may seem daunting at first... but the game's aesthetics are clear and not unpleasant to the eyes, which helps to cut down on confusion. The levels also start easy and then ramp up on difficulty until they are very tough. Although if you can't seem to get the optimisation rewards on some levels, you can use one of the guides on the internet with a convenient copy and paste feature. If you're just here for the achievements, this makes the game trivial. Personally, I did not like the story or character design that much (but that is objective and you may like it more. It is in a similar vein to the one in human resource machine, but not the same.) The puzzles are great though. Recommended if you're interested in programming, even if you have no knowledge of it! Although playing human ressource machine first will make the experience more pleasant."
29,2682,I'm only doing this because my dad wants me to do programming so here i am
30,2682,!!!!!
31,2682,What could be better than assembly? SIMD. 10/10.
32,2681,ggood
33,2680,"I enjoyed the predecessor ""HUMAN RESOURCE MACHINE"" a bit more, so I'd suggest getting that first as it has a simpler/more limited set of instructions.But if you liked it, you'll also like this."
34,2677,"My review will be pretty similar to the one for Human Resource Machine, as this game is so alike.Pretty fun/original puzzle game, disconcerting pseudocode but you get used to it, works nice in windowed mode.I'd say the only major difference with Human Resource Machine is that you can skip cutscenes in this one, yay!On the minus side, there is still no sound/volume setting.On the minus side as well, it really feels like there is nothing noticeable new. If you liked Human Resource Machine and want more, go for it. If you feel you're getting bored... give it a pass : it's just ~66 levels of the very same thing."
35,2675,"This game saved my life.I am 46.My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiralling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5  minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.Thank you."
36,2675,Its a great game if you like writing programs
37,2674,"It's an entertaining game involving introduction to programming concepts in a unique (and sometimes surrealist) art form - very similar to World of Goo.Challenge level depends pretty heavily on your experience with programming algorithms, but they also provide a few different type of objectives for each level which is nice for replay (just pass it, least # lines, fastest).I'm still playing through it, but it's a nice relaxing game to play that literally only needs your mouse.I'd recommend trying it."
38,2673,"7 Billion Humans is a programming game that's pretty much a sequel to Human Resource Machine. The game consists in solving programming challenges using visual blocks representing commands to give to each ""person"" on screen.The game can get very challenging, especially if you want to optimize your program. The art style is is charming and the story is minimal, but it doesn't need to be any more than that. It could be more user friendly: you can't copypaste specific parts and programs can become labyrinthic in the later levels.In the end I'd say that if you like programming you are going to like this game."
39,2673,great
40,2671,The challenge are real.  The people are cute.  Good programming exercise!
41,2670,"Pretty entertaining, with the silly scenarios, and the puzzles are probably a reasonable challenge for most people but if you're a programmer this will likely be a bit boring."
42,2670,"It could be much more user friendly: you cannot copy - paste specific parts, or it's not as easy as working on a text program. The language is a little weird and if statements become a labyrinth after a while, but it's the charm of the game."
43,2669,neato
44,2669,"This game was just perfect for me. The core of the game is educational material. Some sort of introduction to computer programming. Don't run away when you hear ""education"" in review! It doesn't feel like it for a second. Is is rather entertaining and often quite challenging collection of puzzles. I would like to give a special praise to the subtle humor. This game is good as a game, but it is even better as an social commentary kind of art. You have to play it just for that."
45,2668,"Very simple, very good game that mixes basic programming with puzzles of all difficulties. Early levels feel like a breeze, but later levels will make you go insane at times."
46,2668,Distributed systems programming has never been so fun.
47,2668,"One of my favourite games ever!I deal for casual gamers who prefers thinking a bit. No pressure - unless you'd like to meet the challenges...Really good:- the whole game design and feeling is the best, smooth quality feeling, scalable window, cool graphics- challenges are really well designed and sometimes looks impossible at first look (at later stages)- tutorial is the game itself, hints are helpful- good sense of humor- motivating: what are the next rooms? new instructions?- my son loves the coffee breaks so muchTo improve: really just for feedback, this game is well done- major: more like this!!! :-)- medium: more than 16x speed- minor: ""step back"" would be nice (as in Human Resource) - minor: once people done, it would be nice to see the whole screen and see the states (can be solved by easily adding an endless loop)- minor: I liked that people have names. Why randomly re-assign those?- minor: sound effects are a bit annoying- minor: Boss text should be skippable as a whole (both in the beginning and when solved)Feature ideas:- IF statement on what's heard & say a number or a variable - subroutines of course- more tabs or save code option to have more versions (5 would be enough)- textual comments, no just I write w/my mouse sg. Keep graphics, really cool as wellThis is the game you buy as you'd like to support the makers to make more like this. So unique and well made.Thank you!"
48,2668,"I enjoy this game a lot. I have software developer education but chose to pursue marketing. Even so I like this game, because it trains my mind. It can be fun and very challenging.If you are a hardcore developer you definitely should complete it by 100%"
49,2667,"I run it for the first time and I played for 11 hrs straight. My brain is burning, but I love this game. I highly recommend!"
50,2666,"It's fun to be encouraged to be a terrible 'clever' programmer, with zero cares about robustness or maintainability.  Also, non-programmers in the house wanted to try - that's a pretty strong recommendation.Recommend avoiding the ""best known"" speed info - those solutions are often just boring brute-force, e.g. unrolled loops, long programs with explicit directions for each meeple.  The in-game speed goals are great for pushing you to be just a bit more creative though."
51,2666,"Enjoyed this game a lot.Having a programming background, the game for me had the perfect balance between having simple fun tasks that you can try to optimize as well as very challenging levels that can easily escalate into a lot of spaghetti code!"
52,2666,"It's a great game if you like programming puzzles, The language is drag and drop so it's more fun than real work :)Humour is good, you learn to love-hate your bosses!"
53,2666,"I'm sure it will be worth it -- it'll be definitely worth it if you are going to be writing some type of code.But if you just want to feel like a programmer to get things done, this works too."
54,2665,1+12
55,2664,"Worthy sequel to Human Resource Machine. This time instead of emulating a simple CPU, you're emulating something more akin to a GPU: you get a whole team of human people, and you have to give them one shared set of instructions that will lead each of them to be doing the things you need them to do to complete the missions. Single Instruction, Multiple Data."
56,2664,"After playing through this game for a while, several things got really annoying to work with. Code can't be shifted around easily, boolean operation precedence doesn't make sense and if you need to move some conditions around, you have to do so manually which gets really frustrating. There are other programming puzzle games on the market that I'd rather spend time on."
57,2664,"In short - Human Resource Machine goes multithreaded, and improves in many ways.As its predecessor, 7 Billion Humans is a design puzzle game, dealing with visual programming tasks. While HRM was single-threaded, in 7BH you need to move multiple operators to complete the objectives - which makes things more chaotic, and consequently, not always faster.The programming ""language"" is improved compared to HRM - while there are only a few additional communication and interaction operations, the ""standard"" operations are more usable, especially the IFs. There are still no loops and no subroutines though - both are problematic if you are an experienced programmer (you'll cringe at seeing your own solutions), and also if you're learning programming (you'll acquire some horrible practices). Best strictly treat it as a game.The challenges are also improved, the difficulty curve is nice and the later levels require some cogitation instead of mindless duplication which was such a significant part of HRM. Also, the game does a good job introducing some of the challenges of multi-threaded programming, and in a funny way.The editor is basically the same as in HRM - navigating big programs is still painful, and there's still no in-program copy / paste, but otherwise it's nice, intuitive and slick. In general, the presentation is very much recognizable Tomorrow Corporation, and thereby excellent.All in all, solid improvement over the already nice previous game, and fun to play - easy to recommend."
58,2664,"Nice, fairly simple game about programming concepts. Gets fairly tough by the end and needs some understanding of math concepts by that point."
59,2663,"Like to rule other people? Or maybe you are beginning programmer? Or you just want to solve some puzzles? Anyway, this the game for YOU! But watch out for shredders!"
60,2662,"Really enjoyable if you want to practice programming and logical statements.  I haven't finished the game yet, but there has been one level that I accomplished the goals in the solution, and it wouldn't mark it as finished.  Don't know what was up with that, but I just re-wrote it better, and it was accepted.  Besides that, really fun and makes you think of creative ways to solve problems."
61,2662,"I'm a programmer. This is the first ""programming game"" I've played and I must say I really enjoyed it.Solving most puzzles was more or less straight-forward (except for the last several levels). But doing the so-called ""optional challenges"" was not. On each level, you are tasked to optimize for time and to optimize for code length (given the target time/length). This tends to get very, very tricky - to the point where occasionally I had to call it quits and get back at it the next day. These challenges aren't impossible though and there are many hints or even complete solutions on the web in case you get completely stuck.The game is very easy to pick up and nicely polished. Definitely an upvote from me, although I must say I felt like the game didn't really use its full potential. It keeps introducing new commands/concepts/tasks all the way through to the end; while it's technically a good thing on its own, I just wish it had some larger, longer, and more complex levels later on. But all in all I'm still happy to have played through it."
62,2661,"This is basically a programming with inconvenient UI and lack of good debugging tools. If you can solve ""puzzles"" in this game then you are probably already a programmer and I don't know why you would do this after programming during the day.Previous game was fun because it was working like assembly language - not often do you get to play with this nowadays. This one however is just a pointless reimplementation of CodeWars"
63,2661,fun and challenging
64,2661,.
65,2661,A+ programming game. Harder than the original and with more levels!
66,2661,More of Human Resources Machine. You already know.
67,2661,"Still not as long or difficult as most Zach-likes, but does get tricky towards the end. Especially if you go for all the optional challenges. (I'm currently 5 or 6 levels away from completion.)"
68,2660,Very good programming game.Perhaps a beginner also can play with that
69,2660,"EDIT: I just learned about a new issue to overcome. Async-spot swapping. Apparently two people won't swap spots without both humans wanting to walk in to each other AT THE SAME TIME. How do I even fix this issue without NOPs or inter-process communications?if (not a programmer){if (already have game && made it really far in the game){Just become a programmer at this point. Programming is 10 times easier then trying to program multi-threaded-esque programs with a sloppy and horribly lacking interface and inadequate debugging tools.}else{Just play Human Resource Machine by the same developers. The UI/Tools used in this game is essentially copy-pasted from that game and its a good fit for it. You don't need much more than what's provided for Human Resource Machine. This game on the other hand should have way more in terms of debugging tools. For the limited programming controls, I've played enough Zachtronics games that having limited controls over solving a puzzle can lead to creative solutions, but this game shows that there is a right and wrong way to do that. This game did it the wrong way and created a frustrating environment to work in.}else{This game just isn't very fun to solve. I find myself getting lost very easily in what I wrote, too scared to write comments because they both take up a lot of valuable screen space and are hard to write because they are stylus based? I guess this game was developed for touch screens maybe? I never used the comments in the previous game.I did enjoy the beginning of the game, but it very quickly started to become a tedious mess instead of an engaging experience once they added in randomness. I was excited about the idea, but the implementation of controls is just so lacking, that you find yourself just wanting to program it correctly instead of with all limbs except one arm tied behind your back. Just goes to show that there's more to making a good programming puzzle game than making limited controls compared to real life and implementing difficult levels.}After all that being said, I still look forward to whatever they make next. I love the developer's work since they used to call themselves 2D Boy, but I'll be more dubious about their next puzzle game."
70,2660,It changes the way you think. Never a bad thing!
71,2660,"Human Resource Machine was great. So is this. If you like programming or logical puzzles, this is a great buy."
72,2660,I am already a person who does a bit of coding. And this is a game i would recommend to to solve tasks and challenges to get the simple idea of programming. Descriptive and fun that it had a story. I am pretty sure someone has use of this game.
73,2660,"Not as solid as its predecessor, Human Resource Machine, due to the new mechanics which introduce random data cubes. The UI is also very cumbersome."
74,2660,"If agent programming is't you job, this game is a fun way to stretch your brain cells a little."
75,2660,"I recommend the other game by the same developers called Human Resources Machine. But this game felt like a chore. If you don't know programming, that game is sufficient. You won't learn anything new here. If you know programming, you are used to things in actual programming that makes this program a chore towards the 2nd half of the game and not fun. I still intend to finish this game because I am a glutton for punishment.... I mean... I don't like leaving things half done after starting to work on it when I know I can finish it. Suggestions for improvement: 1. Allowing copying pasting of code segments. 2. Allowing typing and autofill (instead of having to drag and drop)3. More user friendly loops instead of jump."
76,2660,assembly for idiots
77,2660,Challenging puzzles with some silly humor mixed in.
78,2660,"Not a terrible game, but not as solid as its predecessor. Its pushing the interface to its limits and this can make it difficult to know exactly how anything is going to behave. -This was made significantly worse by the game then introducing random movements, and what really broke me was Level 32 which can not be solved. (Or should I say optimised.) You can get lucky to come under the 6 you need to pass it by just having them wander randomly and hit all the boxes, but it will always have some failures. Id report this as a bug, but given the shoddy random solutions for prior levels I get the distinct impression this is just the best you can do.-When your graphical programming puzzle game has puzzles that are won on dice rolls something has gone very, very wrong. Until this is fixed I wouldnt bother with it. Buy a Zachtronics game instead."
79,2659,"there is a stage named ""  Glory Hole  ""you'll get something completely different if you try to google it for a possible solution (   )"
80,2659,Amazing but hard to join the game on ipad
81,2659,"Very fun game, and relaxing."
82,2658,"A great game in the same vein as Human Resource Machine (one of my favourites).  Lots of good problem solving, excellent introduction to some fundamental programming concepts, and done in a cute, quirky, silly way.Be warned though, this game is hard to 100%.  Getting every level optimised is an exercise in frustration and anger management. :)"
83,2658,"Just as good, and just as frustrating, as Human Resource Machine."
84,2658,Very cool puzzle game.
85,2658,Quite hard but rewarding
86,2658,so good logic game.am I really a programmer?
87,2658,"I really dig Zachlikes (Shenzhen I/O is perhaps my favourite one), and this is one of the few not made by Zach that's still quite good.The difficulty in this is turned way down (until the end), making it more appropriate for a younger audience (or a non-programmer audience). I think if you've ever found the genre a bit unapproachable, this is the perfect place to whet your whistle."
88,2657,I love this game :)

90,2657,Super fun. I loved it.
91,2657,"O jogo  muuuuito divertido e desafiante ao mesmo tempo, at agora estou tentando concluir tudo perfeitamente!"
92,2656,"-Loud and unskippable splash screen whenever you start and exit the game.-Lots of useless and unskippable dialog at the beginning of every level.-Other unskippable animations throughout the game.-Randomly interrupting gameplay to ask if you want a hint.-Honestly really bad BGM that turns itself back on every time you start the game.Considering how many games this developer has made in the past, you would think they would be on top of really obvious stuff like this. They all pile up and turn a great game into an unbearable one."
93,2656,"I wasn't sure about buying this game, as I work as a programmer and thought the puzzles might be too simple for people used to coding and solving these sorts of logic problems. Fortunately, the developers have you covered by including optional challenges to really up the difficulty. It's taken me 25 hours to complete the game with all the optional challenges, so it feels like money well spent (5 minutes of which was going back to get the killbot achievement :P )Recommended for anyone who enjoys the satisfaction of a well crafted system dropping everything into place. If you're the sort of person who wants to tweak things to perfection, you can definitely get your fix here. I've seen some complaints that the ""speed"" challenges are arbitrary on what ""takes time"", but I have to disagree with those sorts of statements. Invalid operations waste time and logic tests (e.g. IFs) are also slow to run... that all makes sense to me. My one complaint is that it feels like some of the speed challenges are most easily completed by simply writing many repeated lines of code. I slogged through them to get to 100%, but I could see people running out of patience and getting disillusioned with the optional challenges because of it."
94,2655,"Description: 7 Billion Humans is an indie programming simulator released by Tomorrow Corporation in 2018, a sequel to their 2015 release Human Resource Machine. The game is able to visualize complex programs through the actions of human workers, adding a level of both engagement and humor to an otherwise boring genre. In this game you generate your own code by arranging pre-fabricated commands and logic gates while trying to complete the objective for that particular floor. As you ascend the tower you unlock more commands and other tools to use, while the challenges get progressively more difficult.Graphics/Art Style: Visually this game is nothing special, but it doesnt need to be. Gameplay comes first in a puzzle game like this, and the unique art style creates an engaging environment to run programs in. The animations and visuals are clear, which aid in understanding what is happening during code simulation. There are very few cutscenes, but they are fun and humorous while describing the limited plot of the game.Audio: There is no voice-acting in 7 Billion Humans outside of a few cutscenes, which is a good decision. Not having voiceover or a narrator helps the player focus on the task at hand. Instead they opt for the Charlie-Brown-teacher method of voice acting, which adds a degree of simplicity and charm. The other sound effects throughout the game are clear and convey their actions well. Music: The music is surprisingly good. Most of the tracks are very mild and do not distract from the programming. Some others are more involved, but they are heard mostly in cutscenes and towards the end of the game.Controls/UI: The user-interface is very simplistic, which is a good thing. You select one of three program tabs then drag and drop the various program commands into the tab then re-arrange them until you have your desired program. There are some nice quality of life features, including being able to copy and paste programs between tabs. My one criticism involves the Jump command, which is this games method of looping and skipping around your program. Functionally it works just fine, but visually it can get very difficult to follow the arrows when troubleshooting large programs.Gameplay/Difficulty:  There are two primary facets to gameplay. There is a primary goal for each puzzle, accompanied by two optional challenges. They involve real world programming challenges: trying to complete the program in the fastest time possible, and also with the fewest lines of code. The standard challenges are balanced and paced appropriately, with difficulty and complexity increasing gradually as you go up each floor. The optional challenges can be exceedingly difficult, which is exactly what you want with optional content in a puzzle game.Replayability: Unfortunately puzzle games inherently lack replay value, and 7 Billion Humans is no exception. I do not see myself going back to play this game any time soon.Writing/Story: N/ALength/Price/Value: 35 hours played, purchased at full price for $15, adding up to 43 cents per hour. The game was paced well, and didnt drag on at any point.Recommendation: I thoroughly enjoyed 7 Billion Humans. If you enjoy programming and puzzle games then I would highly recommend it. Even if you just enjoy puzzles but know nothing about programming this is a great way to learn the basics and have fun while doing so."
95,2654,Very nice game that manages to make programming light and accessible. The idea of programming little men to do something is fun and allows you to learn many of the basic concepts of programming.Even those who already program will find some challenging levels but above all it will be challenging to be able to complete all levels with 3 stars.Obviously recommended only for those interested in logic and programming.
96,2654,"The puzzles just aren't very fun to complete, they're less fun to optimize, and there's not very many of them. Mechanics are used for only a few levels instead of developed over longer stretches of the game.The game doesn't give you constraints on how complex your program can be. This is a problem for making the game fun, since _a_ solution is usually obvious, it would just be laborious to ""type"" by dragging the blocks in place. The main constraint is that the programming language is really bad, and inconsistent. You have a ""nearest"" command that remembers identities of people and blocks, but not the identities of walls. You can compare to blocks on the ground, but you can't calculate based on them. You can walk through employees sometimes but not always.The game offers constraints in the form of optimization challenges. The game doesn't really do a great job at making sure you're actually solving the task and not finding a way to cheat, which makes it less fun knowing you can sometimes easily get a ""better"" score by making a ""wrong"" solution.The speed optimization challenges are frustrating. Since there's no limit on program size, you're encouraged to ruthlessly ""unroll"" and ""inline"" to avoid extra calculations. The timings of individual commands are unintuitive, and so ""synchronization"" has to be done by just knowing the timings and not actually making something very robust.The space challenges are real challenges, but extremely difficult. I beat all of the levels in TIS-100 including ResearchNet, but couldn't bring myself to try the challenges in 7 Billion Humans; they were just too tedious."
97,2654,fun pseudo coding game with neat story
98,2653,great for practicing programming and algorithms in a fun way
99,2652,"Good one for programming n00bs, looking forward chinese"
100,2652,Great if you love writing spagetti code.
101,2652,"Very similar to Human Resource Machine, a programming-based puzzle game where you write pseudo-code that every pawn in the level carries out, with the biggest complexity being that each pawn operates on a single, shared instruction set. In this game the levels are significantly more varied, you no longer have dedicated inputs or outputs, and the operations required by each level are much more free-form and abstract. Definitely a difficulty increase compared to the previous game, but still fun overall."
102,2651,"One of the best (and most literal) games about programming. Charming, simple, and able to offer challenges to both non-programmers and people who code for a living. (I'm the latter.)"
103,2651,"In our high tech world it's sometime hard to remember that computers are fairly simple machines. In this game you need to think like a computer and ask what you want each ""human"" (processor) to do next. Do they step forward? Do they pick something up? What if there's a hole there? Your humans trust you completely and will only do what you tell them to do.My 6 year old is having fun doing the early levels, and my computer programmer husband loves solving and optimizing the higher levels. So I can safely say this is a great game for many ages and skill levels."
104,2650,its basic programming in a fun environment
105,2648,"I started playing the game and it was ok. Then I realized, ""oh, this is just programming."" And I'd probably enjoy learning Python rather than playing this game. So I did. Then I got a job as a Scrum Master, and I lived happily ever after.But really, if you aren't ever going to do real programming, but you like the idea, then maybe you would like the game."
106,2647,My brain hurts.
107,2647,second best work under capitalism simulator i ever played
108,2646,"If you liked Human Resource Machine, you'll love this sequel. I binged it through the first time and I'm already going back through to improve my work and clear the optionals I missed the first time. Five stars."
109,2645,Great programming game
110,2645,Fun game if you know how to program. Impossibly steep learning curve otherwise IMO. It really requires familiarity with a clot of programming concepts.
111,2645,"I really enjoyed this game, but I'm sure it's not for everyone - it's really love it or hate it.Nothing more satisfying than to finally manage to optimize your solution for the achievements after trying for hours."
112,2645,Great intro to programming that's fun
113,2643,IDK
114,2642,"Great game, really makes you think about the programs you make and the challenges are extra hard."
115,2640,Great game!
116,2640,I have not unlocked all 7 billion peoiple but I feel comfortable saying they are all special!
117,2639,Excellent humor.
118,2637,"If you can program a little, this game is really fun at the beginning and too hard on further levels.If you are really good at programming, you will be frustrated about simplicity of this game.Anyways, I recommend :)"
119,2637,"Challenging computing puzzles, many more than in the original Human Resource Machine game."
120,2637,Great game!
121,2636,"I don't have a programming background. With some levels the devs simply did not try giving hints to the solutions. Even if I had the right idea to the solution, executing it got me into an enraging trial & error loop. It gets so frustrating that I had to look up solutions online. Problem is: Those solutions are mostly high end ones getting so abstract, that it's hard to learn any lessons from them. I really want to know the standard solutions the devs had in mind for each puzzle so I can learn lessons the devs wanted to teach me with their puzzles. I hope I could try solving the puzzles on my own again that way. Instead I ended up in a death spiral - learning nothing anymore, only entering solutions from online to proceed. Quality of life is absent as well. Unskippable introductions to puzzles, an absolute copy/paste functions that only copies entire solutions and overwrites anything written before. No audio slider!? AGAIN! Basic stuff.....The worst level is the one where they want you to count upwards in binary. I know how to count in binary, I just want a hint how to execute it. And what is the developer hint for this level? ""If you have problems with this level, look up what binary numbers are online!"" I loved World of Goo, adored Little Inferno and worked my ass off to get through Human Resource Machine. BUT  YOU KYLE, PISS OFF TOMORROW CORPERATION. This is the anti-""World of Goo"" in terms of balancing learning progression. If this game teached me anthing at all about programming, it's that programming must be 1000 problem-solving tricks teached to you by booring books and lectures and I know this can't be true. So absolutely failure this time. Your goal was to advertise programming. You accomplished the exact opposite."
122,2636,"This is dangerously close to being a job, yet still manages to be entertaining.-------------------------The entire game is a series of puzzles that are solved using a visual programming language. It will teach you the basic concepts used in programming logic and then expect you to solve how to use that logic to manipulate people and data cubes into completing a set goal for each level.This could easily be used as an introduction to programming logic concepts and some of the later puzzles are abstract enough to be useful models for ideas like multithreading. It's not going to fully teach you how to be an engineer, but it's a heck of an introductory crash course in the basic concepts.If you like the idea of using a programming language to solve puzzles or want an introduction to the basic logic used, this is a funny and entertaining way to get it. Then again you are getting bossed around by brain dead managers and doing menial repetitive job tasks, after the novelty and humor wear off, it can start to feel like a real job. And if you've ever had a boss that didn't know your job as well as you and relied on you to solve all of their problems, this might feel a bit too much like real life.---While you are here, would you consider following my curator page?Want to read all of my reviews and not just the curated ones?"
123,2636,"Yes, but I prefer the Part 1, HUMAN RESOURCES MACHINE because this more easy than HRM.The good: * This have more levels* This have more fun* This have more uniques levels very cool* The history is bestThe bad:* a bit more easy than HRM"
124,2635,Write a review for 7 Billion HumansPlease describe what you liked or disliked about this game and whether you recommend it to others.Please remember to be polite and follow the Rules and Guidelines.
125,2635,It's fun but they REALLY need to add volume controls to this game.
126,2635,"If you liked Human Resource Machine, you'll love this one too!"
127,2634,love the game
128,2633,I'm using it to illustrate students how business processes are engineered and what typical mistakes are. It's pretty funny and compelling for them to figure out how to build it properly and what real world lessons are.
129,2633,"Relaxing and fun programming game, with some nice nods to office behavior."
130,2633,"this is the game, when you're trying to order a chaos inside of the office building. Good luck with that! :)It is a bit strange learning curve, especfally for those, who already played Human Resource Machine, but anyway, I liked these puzzles a lot"
131,2632,"As someone who enjoys coding, I like this game.Compared to its predecessor Human Resource Machine, it offers new functionalities and thus new puzzles. The optional challenges now also feature the globally best stats, which is a nice addition.From a completionist's perspective: 100% means beating all optional challenges. While most of them are rather generous in their requirements, a few are tough nuts to crack. That is if you don't want to rely on guides, though."
132,2631,you could have a good time in the game
133,2630,Much bigger and more challenging than Human Resource Machine with parallel processing and better testing speed. Screen is still too small for bigger programs though.
134,2630,Good puzzle game.A bit too much like work?!
135,2630,Finally finished the game and optimized all the levels.
136,2630,"The gameplay is great: Algorithm logic puzzles, well explained, gradually rising from the simple to the brain-wrecking. Plus, a fun and extremely nicely realized setting."
137,2630,"Parallel computing is hard, but also very fun."
138,2629,"I'm a computer programmer so at first I thought it was an intro to programming game and that I wasn't the right audience for it. However, the speed and size challenges won me over. It takes this game from good to great. It reminded me what I loved about programming in the first place. I loved getting those little highs from solving the challenges. I definitely recommend."
139,2629,Brilliant game
140,2628,"Use a basic programming language to command multiple people to solve problems. A sequel to Human Resources Machine, the focus here is on using a simple imperative language on very parallel architecture. Solving many of these requires a fair amount of thought but there are also optimisation challenges. As hard as you want to make it. If you enjoy programming games you'll probably enjoy this."
141,2628,"Really smart game, good to learn programming. Some of the puzzles get to be a bit ludicrious, but overall it is quite good."
142,2627,Very fun game and so addictive.It would also make a great introduction to programming if you want to learn.
143,2627,"More semi-assembler like puzzle coding fun, now with multiple threads and some different instructions."
144,2627,"I recommend playing Human Resource Machine first (e.g. mobile version), as introduction to the interface, mechanics and logic. If you enjoy that, 7 Billions Humans won't disappoint you. Except if you really expect more than 50 on a floor. Goodbye!"
145,2627,Sound is unbelivevable loud and there is no way to turn in down.
146,2627,"7 Billion Humans is a game of programing puzzles. If like puzzles or like programing	Then like 7 Billion Humans	Else don't buy 7 Billion Humans; The only drawback I have to the game is that whenever someone watches me play it, they inevitably or invariably try to backseat code the puzzles.  Some of the puzzles get pretty complicated, after you solve the puzzle there are 2 additional challenges, one to solve it with less steps, and 2 to solve it faster,  Sometimes you can satisfy both at the same time, sometimes not."
147,2627,"Incredible coding game. It stays light, but has a lot of depth.Very cute, very well done, even funny.Very interesting to try to optimize your solutions, it's like a second layer of depth in every puzzle."
148,2627,If you like human resource machine then you will like this game. That's honestly exactly as much as I can say about this game.
149,2626,"Great game! Beware, it can be quite difficult if you want to meet all the challenges.Don't listen to ""I'm a IT pro, where's the manual? Wrong game"". This is a game and not a programming language, take the time to play around and figure out the mechanism of how the GAME works."
150,2625,"This game is absolutely intellectually simulating. For those who would want to pick up coding, this is a must have!"
151,2625,It is a fun game. Pretty Challenging.
152,2625,"I didn't get very far into the game before dragging around code blocks became frustrating, especially the way it creates ""else"" blocks as you drag over an if statement. I'm not sure the game wants you to work on solutions, as you have to click through dialog and wait for the simulated solutions each time. Maybe there were ways to speed this up, but I didn't care enough to find them. There are simply better games to solve these challenges in."
153,2625,"Liked the Human Resource Machine?There's more, much more!"
154,2624,"Fun and challenging game, I wans't expecting I would play it this longThe OCDs were getting to me some times and couldnt rest untill I solved it.Pros:Good ramp up in difficultyMost levels are funCons:No priority  in conditional statements Some speed OCDs required me to hardcode lots of code, and this gets tedious with drag and drop and no way to copy short bits of code"
155,2624,"Very cool programming game, enjoyed a lot"
156,2624,I picked this up after seeing it recommended in a Stack Overflow blog (seriously!) I've already put 5 hours into it (had it less than a day).  So simple but addictive :)
157,2624,"The puzzles presented here have a nice twist from the previous game in that you order multiple humans around. The difficulty is fairly high - especially if you try to pass the optimization challenges. Not all humans should do the same actions, but they all share one task list, so some code in later levels must be used to differentiate - that clutters up the task list.Memory slots and communicating signals between the humans further complicates things and written code gets really hard to read. Thankfully the drag-and-drop system is well polished and makes it hard to do the wrong thing or something destructive.The music can be disabled but the environment sound still plays, so the windows mixer must be directly used to mute the game - a shame since that should be an easy option to implement."
158,2624,Nice casual programming game during the lockdown for programming challenges and quirky humor. This can make you stressed out if you go for the optimization challenges to the problems. I just played the game to find a solution which works and did not go into the optimization route. Fun game if you like programming challenges. The interface though where commands are given is not as efficient as an IDE!! But the level is casual enough and in my 3 hour playtime till now U did not find any challenges to be too complicated to just get it working. The animations are great as expected from the creators of world of goo.This is not like any zachtronics games where the levels get too complicated later atleast until now and new commands get introduced frequently. Hope the difficulty is consistent as is during these initial stages which gives a fun and relaxing experience.
159,2624,This is a great puzzle game. It uses programming concepts to make a really interesting and unique game
160,2623,"Lots of fun, but one thing I hate is the  music. comes on at 1000% volume and you can't mute it till the menu loads. (It does not save your mute over reboots)"

164,2623,Really fun game. It's funnier if you program for a living. I'm breezing through the first few challenges but it's still really funny and engaging. I have a feeling it's about to get difficult. If you are a noob who wants to LEARN TO CODE buy this game ASAP and play through it.Great game!!!! Buy it!!!
165,2623,"I'm enjoying this game, but I'm not sure it's worth the buy. There's at least two reasons to be interested in this game, so I want to get into both.One major group is people who like programming. I'm a programmer at [tech company], and when I get tired of the sad programming I do at work, I like to relax with some happy programming, particularly in a game like this. And this game is tricky enough to really tickle the brain (parallel programming is hard, yo!). But if you want to enjoy this game you have to avoid the speed and size challenges. The game claims they are HARD, but what they really mean is the programming language is ESOTERIC and OPAQUE, which means the challenges are UNINTUITIVE.Maybe you, the reader, want to benchmark the language, google all of its hidden features, and find a way to turn the challenges into true puzzles. But for lazy folks like me, the challenges will be forever elusive, because the game doesn't give you the tools to understand them. Check out this thread https://steamcommunity.com/app/792100/discussions/0/1733210552679860283/ for discussion of a challenge where MORE instructions take LESS time to execute. (n.b. if the devs ever release a detailed manual or specification for the execution model, all of this is moot and I will change to a recommendation)What about people who have less experience with programming, and want to try something new? I still wouldn't recommend this game. This game is hard to get into; as of April 2020 less than 5% of players have completed it. The prequel, Human Resource Machine, is easier to understand, and probably a better entry point. Games by Zachtronics (like SpaceChem or Infinifactory) also teach you to think like a programmer, and they have much better documentation. (If you're into retro, games like Shenzhen IO and TIS 100 come with printable manuals.) Casting a broader net, the wikipedia category Programming Games (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Programming_games) is pretty sparse, but contains gems like Baba is You and Hackmud.

213,2615,awesome puzzle game
214,2615,There are too many humans
215,2613,"Great little puzzle game with decent brain teasers.Much like Zachtronic games, the optimization goals provide a good incentive to come back to a given puzzle more than once."
216,2613,This games makes you think and is fun at the same time. I would recommend it to anyone.
217,2613,"After level 20: I liked Human Ressources Machine a little bit better, but it's still a great game!"
218,2612,"One line review:If you would like to spend level after level creating psudocode, directing minions to do your bidding, then this series of logic puzzles is for you!"
219,2612,"It took me hours to realize why this game is so much more frustrating than it seemed like it should be. I've written assembly programs before. I didn't realize at first why I was writing duplicate code so much more often than I do when actually programming. But I've figured it out about 4/5ths into the game. There's no jump return. This is an absolute killer when it comes to what programmers like doing - cutting problems into parts and isolating each part in it's own method. In this game, if you section off code for a specific purpose, there's no way to return to where you called the method. So you can't call a method from multiple places outside specific circumstances. Which means you're forced to write duplicate code over and over, which is both tedious and feels wrong because normally that's a warning sign that you're writing bad code. This is all frustrating because actually solving the puzzles is fun, and turtle programming, assembly, and multithreading is a combination you'll probably never encounter outside this game, which means these are all puzzles you've never seen before, but that missing jump return means actually implementing your solution is a chore nearly every single time.Plot wise, I didn't finish it, but this is obviously weaker than, for example, world of goo in that aspect, for one major reason. In world of goo, you are very involved in the story during gameplay. Lots of the levels feature plot taking place as you solve the level (most of the chapter finales, for example). In 7 billion humans, the story of the game and the levels are completely isolated."
220,2612,"I liked the puzzles, seems tricky to get through some of the answers, being a software developer doesn't hurt, and my kids seem to like it."
221,2612,If O(1) is very good and O(n!) is very bad this game is O(logn).
222,2612,Fun game. It's a computer programming puzzle game that looks at parallel processing rather than the usual single thread and branches. The game is humorous and pokes fun at large corporate mentality. The game is a worthy successor to the Human Resource Company.
223,2612,I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoyed Human Resource Machine or likes puzzle games in general.
224,2612,I had fun.
225,2612,"It's harder than human resources, and also more challenging. Not very hard to complete, but hard to achieve all goals."
226,2612,It's simply rewarding to find the shortest and the fastest solutions and it's in clever and funny animation.
227,2611,Another fun little programming game.
228,2611,"This is basically a game to teach programming. The twist compared to Human resource machine, is that the code controls many workers parallel.If you are more of a casual gamer, then this is a puzzle game. There is a set of commands and a task, and the small code you write needs to solve the task."
229,2611,its good
230,2610,"This is a 5/10. Human Resource Machine was better / lasted longer for me. This does have enough differences to not feel like a 'part 2' of that game, but some of the levels feel more like you're fighting against the way the game is set up rather than solving the problem"
231,2610,"This is a fun puzzle/coding game.  If you liked Human Resource Machine you will surely like this one even more.  You write assembly-like programs to perform complex tasks with little people on a grid.  Some of the challenges are classic computer science problems, but can be very hard with the limited primitives provided."
232,2610,"I thoroughly enjoyed this game. If you like solving logic problems, this is the game for you."
233,2610,Really a lot of fun
234,2610,Think-tank addiction
235,2610,"Just like its predecessor, it's a cute little puzzle and logic game with its own charm. I would think that if you're trying to learn programming languages, this is a great game to train your mind in the right patterns.At the same time I have to say that the puzzles do quickly increase in difficulty, and if you're not fully committed to the logic behind it, you won't have much of a chance to beat the level goals aside from 'manage it somehow'"
236,2609,Great problem solving game! It's also interesting to watch workers walking around :-) .
237,2609,How to kill 7 Billion Humans simulation.
238,2609,"Really fun, low-level programming! I would recommend it for anyone who likes problem-solving :)"
239,2609,"This adds more advanced control flow compared to the original Human Resource Machine, so you don't get stuck on the same repetitive stuff. But, it still manages to be challenging - dare I say even more so than the original? Absolutely awesome little game, I wish there was a sandbox with these little guys running around following whatever you want to happen."
240,2609,"It's a neat game, but the interface is such an enormous pain to use that it saps the fun out of it for me. There's also no tools at all to help you understand what's taking the time in your solution, making it obnoxious to try and go for the speed challenges."
241,2609,The basics of parallel programming are in there but it would be nice to have the code match an open source library.  It would be also nice to show some optimization tips.  This is still a great way to understand what is happening in some algorithms.
242,2608,Genuinely a lot better than Human Resource Machine.  Ends up being a lot less spaghetti code with a million jumps making it impossible to read.
243,2608,Big brain game
244,2608,"The only thing I didnt like about this game is that it ended,"
245,2608,I am enjoying the game so far. I've heard it was a programming game for non-programmers. I guess that is fair!I am a former programmer and wish there were more facilities like the ability to write functions for repetitive tasks. I suppose I have the ESP32 and Arduino IDE for that. All-in-all I am very happy with my purchase.
246,2608,"Welcome to 7 Billion Humans, the game where the humans act like robots and the robots act like humans. Watch in awe as the humans follow their Assembly instructions and walk into a shredder while the robots engage in workplace banter and perform a synchronized calisthenics routine."
247,2608,"While HRC focused on processing, 7BH focuses on parallel processing.  You need to write code for the little peons under your control to get them to do trivial meaningless tasks for their robot overlords.This isn't as good as the Zachtronics games - far too much depends on undocumented and/or effectively non-deterministic behavior.  Because of that, near the end I gave up on the extended (OCD) goals and just settled for any working solution.  But even with that caveat, it was pretty fun and worth the time, and as usual Tomorrow Corporation games have a great sense of humor."
248,2608,code people. get jobs
249,2608,I enjoyed it.
250,2608,"Great follow up to Human Resource Machine.  If you enjoyed that game or if you enjoy games made by Zachtronics, such as TIS-100 or SpaceChem, you should purchase 7 Billion Humans."
251,2608,"Very good sequel to the original game - if you liked the original, then get this one too."
252,2608,"The game is for the technically minded, so hopefully you know at least a very little about coding so you're familiar with the base logic involved. It's not a requirement, but without it you might be shocked about the level of logic required going past the beginning. Beyond that, the game is good. Every day I think I've maxed out how far I can get, but every next day I come back and make advances. I seem to have figured out my mind works better in the morning/daytime. Very addictive and highly recommended."
253,2608,I like that the optimization goals are all realistic. The challenges are pretty narrowly defined so there aren't a whole lot of different ways to solve them if you are going for the fastest time or fewest number of lines. It's nice knowing that you can do better and working towards that. And very rewarding when you beat the goals. I also enjoyed the humor throughout! I'd say this was definitely a step up from the HR machine. This took me almost 40 hours to optimize all the levels.
254,2608,This is a fairly unique programming game which builds on the series.
255,2608,"One of the best puzzle games I've ever played. Even as a programmer, this game can be quite challenging at times. Especially the extra challenges (every level has a speed and a size challenge) can be very hard to figure out.  But it never gets to the point where it seems impossible to do, so it always remains fun."
256,2608,Multi threading programming with a lot of goto statements. What's not to like?
257,2608,I love programming now.
258,2607,Very well written puzzle/coding game. Good for kids and adults.
259,2607,its good
260,2607,Simple idea with great graphics and complex interactions.
261,2607,my brain hurts
262,2607,"7 Billion Humans is meaningfully distinct from Human Resource Machine, but your opinion on the former will probably be the same as your opinion on the latter.  Wouldn't recommend to anyone who isn't already decently familiar with programming."
263,2607,A fun little puzzle game for people who like programming/logic puzzles.
264,2607,"EDIT: Changed to Negative now that I have replayed it. 7 Billion Humans is not a good parallel programming puzzle when the best solutions involve destroying all workers aside from 1 at the start. At least the first half of a game is still nice.Oh wow, I actually did it. I beat this nice big brain boi. I now have the big brain. Fear my brain and call it Brian, for otherwise it will rip my head off.This was quite a change from the prequel. Where in prequel, Human Resource Machine, it was rather down-to-Earth assembly, with many puzzles being something that were rather been-there-done-that for my student experience, this one shot straight for parallel (a word which I hate for I can't remember which consonant is double) programming, something that I have zero experience. And boy, I fear parallel programming now. John Carmack said nothing wrong... if I remember right. Something about being disappointed in multicore?...Wait, no, he never claimed that he hated multicore, just checked. F for my anecdote.Well, it's not just parallel programming that is new. The language is now a small-time high-low level programming mess. But it works. But now it's less fitting to PC archtecture, for now workers can move over any space in the room and you have to account for time it takes for the workers to perform an action, otherwise everything may desynchronize, so much for your parallel programming skills. Okay, you probably have to do the latter in real programming too but it's never about ""worker"" moving across whole ""room"", get it?Still, half of time puzzles and solution are beautiful and another half of time they are ugly to look at and I just want to forget they existh. In a sense of hackyness, I mean. But puzzles actually made me stumble and think a lot, so that was great. I also would often look into guides to see other people solutions for optional challenges and learn a bit from them. There are still space and performance optional challenges, yas. This time around, it's performance challenges that often lead to nice beautiful code. Performance now takes into account the time itself instead of commands. Randomized values may bite you there. Size of code requirement is bloody ugly 99%, each worker often having to perform same codes that often have obsolote operation for them. For example, you will have to deal with witnessing one of the workers complaining that he has nothing to pick up all because others do have to pick up a datacube.Rules weren't always clear enough however. Whether worker moving into another worker's will swap places with him or get blocked never seemed clear enough. Also, there is now ""if"" command that can multiple ""or"" and ""and"" operators. I don't think that game has implemented logic operators priorities either. And in code size challenge, they all count as a single piece of code, with ""else"" being seen as another line that impacts the size challenge.Overall? Worth it!Something big is coming... Could it be?.. Biggg Data!Bwaha!Give me more of that music like Lady Sky track! Free soundtrack included, great!Oh, and plot wasn't painfully boring this time. There is barely a spoon of it but it was cute and funny."
265,2607,-
266,2607,Dystopian swarm programming. Lovely.
267,2606,Great programming game.
268,2606,If only there was more... lots more.
269,2606,it's good
270,2606,"Excellent Tomorrow Corporation quality game play with similar play style and looks as Human Resource Machine. If you liked that game, you'll like this as well."
271,2606,Writing command lists to be executed by your little workers in an office concurrently. Can be surprising even for programmers!  Good fun for kids too.
272,2606,"The 60+ levels are mostly really fun to solve, can recommend to anyone that likes to program.The only bad thing I would say is that I am not a fan of the smallest and fastest solution.It could be that I am just a bad programmer but sometimes the fastest solution (especially when you arrive at the read levels) is just to make  a really long if else if else ... program which is not only not something that is fun but when you then do this using the UI and the debugger it quickly is a chore to do it without any enjoyment or satisfaction which is why I stopped there.I also looked up what other people did to get the fastest solution because I was going crazy in one level and then I found ""hacks"" like dividing by zero to kill the human instead of walking to a hole which I am also not a fan of but this is not as bad as if else blocks (I still find it dumb that the exercise is to go into a hole and killing the human is the same which I consider not the same).All in all only considering the levels without the later (sometimes) really complicated ones it was a really fun time to debug and solve because the editor/debugger are nice to use as long as there are not like 30 or more commands where scrolling and moving code quickly stops."
273,2606,"Another fantastic programming game by Tomorrow Corp. The size/speed challenges will test your brain guaranteed, while less program-savvy players should still be able to complete the main levels."
274,2606,"Recommended if you're into puzzle games, especially ""programming"" games/Zach-likes. Fairly gentle learning curve so far (on year 33), and the visual nature of the interface makes more intuitive sense to me than something like TIS-100 (which I also love, but it is so hard)."
275,2606,"This is a challenging and fun game to play.  I like that you can continue without achieving the challenge objectives, although I do try to get as close as I can."
276,2605,"I love essentially every game I've played from Tomorrow Corporation, ranging from Little Inferno, Human Resource Machine to this 7 Billion Humans. If you enjoyed Human Resource Machine, you MUST get this one. If you want to try one of their coding games, I'd say this one is the better of the two. Cut-scenes are fantastic, and the puzzles are challenging and thought provoking."
277,2605,Sequel to the already great programming game! If you're a programmer I think you'll like this game a lot! There are very hard stages from time to time (the last of the two levels that branch to the left) that requires a lot of thinking. These turing machine-esque puzzles strikes the sweet spot between coding and gaming for me!
278,2605,"A GREAT FUN GAME!! Game is quite hard, but yayyyy I just finished all challenges"
279,2605,A fun little coding puzzle game. Not as much burning things as I wanted but there is plenty of shredding :)
280,2605,"Highly recommended even if you have just superficial knowledge of programming  it can be a lot of fun, and feels more like a logic puzzler then coding. Even if you haven't coded anything at all it eases you in slowly. On top of that everything is held together by a humorous story and neat graphics. 5/5"
281,2605,What? 60% discount for prequel owner? mkay why not.look like they shifted difficulty curve a little. I like this a bit more.
282,2605,"Great fun!The early levels will be trivial if you already program, and it could be a bit more clear about memory storing both locations and integers, but it still provides a challenge at the later levels (solving the task usually isn't too difficult, but solving it within the command limit and/or within a certain time can be very tricky)"
283,2605,"its very good. if you're new to psuedo-programming puzzle games, id suggest playing human resource machine first, as this naturally builds on that game. either way, recommended"
284,2604,As strange and beautiful as anything the Tomorrow Corporation has made.
285,2604,An addictive brain-blaster for those of us who genuinely enjoy programming.
286,2604,"Fantastic programming sim puzzle game. The later levels were quite challenging, but I thoroughly enjoyed the ride. All the usual Tomorrow Corp humor and ridiculous cut-scenes are here. I could nitpick, but I won't. I recommend you take on Human Resource Machine first."
287,2604,"Great to have sequel, but it seems they talk just a bit too much...a little minus for lack of sound control(also had some glitches in the background, but turning off full screen fixed it)"
288,2604,"Being a programmer myself, I have to recomment this game. For me, ""developing"" the algorithms for solving these levels is a lot of fun, and it remembers me of the fun part of programming. Getting to a solution is easy enough, but thinking of ways to optimise the solutions with the constraints of the provided ""programming language"" provides you a nice challenge.But if you have never done any coding before, playing this game will teach you lots of usefull skills. First and foremost you'll improve your problem solving skills. Besides this you get to know some of the stuff/constructs programmers have to deal with (code branching, loops, multithreading problems). Good stuff!I personally have just one negative thing to note about this game: the interface is pretty much developed in a mobile first manner (for example, you are able to add comments to your ""code"", but you would have to draw the letters with your mouse... really, really awkward).Thats said... I still absolutely recomment this game to anyone remotely interested in programming and/or puzzles. Just... if you have the possibility to play it on your phone/tabled, just buy this game in the appstore (currently only available on iOS) and play it on these devices."
289,2604,good game
290,2604,"Engaging and fun. Definitely a challenge even for advanced programmers, at least to conquer the efficiency challenges. Can be frustrating if one is a perfectionist and wants to complete all efficiency challenges. But that also means a lot of long hours of entertainment."
291,2604,"very good, like algorythm"
292,2603,Highly recommended.. Great programming sim. There is multiple solutions to the problem.
293,2603,Wonderful game. A worthy successor to The Human resource Machine. The basic premise is the same; make a little program to achieve the arbitrary goal in each level with multiple humans at the same time. it's programming the little humans while keeping in mind the all have the same simple instructions. So if it works for one human it may not work for them all.The challenges are great and seem impossible sometimes and then you find that one jump instruction that's not necessary. Because why let the humans survive?Great puzzle game as an introduction to programming.
294,2603,good
295,2603,"In this game, you have to drag and drop instruction to solve parallel programming mini puzzle.A fun programming game. Each puzzle is well defined and can require quite a bit of thinking to solve. Would recommend to programmer and non programmer alike."
296,2603,"bought this game on day one cause their the first game human resource machine was good, this one is just as good. if you want to be a programmer or are interested in giving it a go i highly recommend this game and human resource machine, they are great for practicing that style of thinking. start with human resource machine first then move on to this one."
297,2602,"Recommend  9.5ProsThis is a fun sequel to Human Resource Machine, expanding on the original by adding parallel processing.  If you liked the first game, youll like this one.  It does require you to think differently when trying to solve the tasks in a parallel way, but I enjoyed it all the way through.ConsInterface is still the same, which means as the code gets longer, using a mouse to drag and drop commands can be a little tedious and tricky, especially long jump commands.  Similarly, tracing code within the small view can be tricky.  I would have like the ability to zoom out to view more lines of code on the screen at once.OverallI would recommend this game to anyone new to coding (and wants to learn parallel processing concepts) or to someone who just wants to play a casual coding game.  If you program professionally, you may find it frustrating that you do not have access to all of your typical debugging tools, but it can still be entertaining."
298,2602,Excellent intro to writing basic A.i. algorithms. Don't get too hung up on optimization you might lose sight of the fun.
299,2601,epic sequel; now multithreaded
300,2601,"This is basically the scratch programming language, but with an aesthetic that says ""work is a grind"" and the trappings of a logic game. Outstanding. Really really stellar art direction ties the whole thing together."
301,2601,"I loved Human Resource Machine and I'm so glad it got a sequel. This game introduces completely new mechanics, it's great for anyone who loves programming or automation."
302,2600,"Dark humor, cute graphics, and programm-y puzzles. Runs great on Linux.---After playing through a number of their competitors, I want to praise the Tomorrow Corporation programming games (Human Resource Machine and 7 Billion Humans) for having, hands down, the best user interface in the genre:- multiple profiles (3)- easily delete profiles through the UI (no rummaging about in the bowels of the directory tree)- defined optimization goals (no relying on friends-based leaderboards)- level selection clearly shows which levels have met the optimization goals- the requirements for the optimization goals are easily accessed from within the level- each level has multiple solution saves (3)- solutions can be copied and pasted between solution saves, levels, and even external editors- solution saves can be easily clearedAlso, bonus points for bright, cheery colors; a sense of humor; and eschewing the whole ""cyberpunk hacking"" cliche."
303,2600,Great logic puzzles. ALmost like a very simplified programming enviroment with graphic inputs.
304,2600,Fun little programming game BUT could have been a lot better if they weren't so lazy with the number of levels used to introduce new concepts which results in a very sharp learning curve for younger players.A steal while on sale in any case whether you want to start learning programming concepts or use what you know to program funny little office workers to do weird things!
305,2600,"Only played 46 mins so far but I know there are a few hours ahead of me!  I love thinking games and this one makes you think, I can programme already and this is like programming using if then statements etc.  It would be a  great tool to help budding programmers hone their skills but it gets quite difficult quickly and might turn them off if they are not resilient.  Great game, makes my head hurt, but that's what I love about it!!"
306,2599,It's like a Zactronics game. Not actually a game but a programming-style 'game'8/10 Would recommend.
307,2599,...
308,2596,"Great game for those looking for a challenge!Has plenty of those ""EUREKA"" moments that's pretty rewarding when you figure out the solution of a puzzle.It starts off pretty easy, up to the point it's gets hard enough that you have to sleep on it and try another day.It took me about 15h to finish to complete the game, now I'm going back to complete all challenges (some of which seem impossible at times).Also it's a fun game for my girlfriend, even though she has no idea on how to do programming.PROS:- very challenging- cute- helps train your logical skillsCONS (or, more accurately, ""WISHLIST""):- could have a Level Editor or Steam Workshop to extend the game- could have leaderboards to ""compete against your friends"""
309,2594,"If you love logic and want to spend up to a hour a day to solve optimization problems in the code, then it's best game for you. Definitely have to try this game if you are familiar with a programming and doesn't hate it (don't have to love it also).  A good music also."
310,2594,brillant corporations critics
311,2592,Awesome programming game. The presentation from cute little worker and music  makes assembly programming fun.If you interested in learning programming in general you can start here!

313,2591,nice sequel to the human resource machine! I like tackling these little programming puzzles...
314,2590,"Great game.I can't stand the french traduction though, looks ugly as hell."
315,2590,"I'd like to thumbs down this one for flaws I mention below, but honestly it's a good concept and pretty fun to mess with and inexpensive, so no point dissing it.I like the concept, and I guess as an intro for people that are just trying to get their head around how programming kinda works its pretty good.But it actively encourages garbage code.  For instance most of the fastest solutions have far MORE instructions than the slower ones... This is because its counting time for the animations against you... So if you are adding to a counter or something, that few seconds while your cute little dude visualizes that math is time you're being penalized for... Mean while if you 'hardcode' it, with inflexible garbage, it will actually run much faster and get you the speed awards.This rather sends the wrong message to new coders I think, tidy code is fast code.  Teach that.It would be nice if it had some concept of subroutines, maybe it does at higher levels, I'm at about 49 so far and it's slow to deliver new commands.   It encourages use of the 'Jump' command as a work around for all kinds of things.. Jump is pretty much a 'Goto' and really, I spend enough time cleaning up that kind of code in the real world.  It ain't funny man.  Anyhow, other than the fact that it teaches you to be a pretty gawd awful coder, it does deliver on some of the basics that a person might want to get their head around if they are heading down that road (don't do it!  For the love of God, just become a fence painter or something, it's not worth the pain)."
316,2590,"I'm about half-way through the game. I think it's a pretty damn good follow-up to Human Resource Machine. The puzzles are challenging but doable. Finding optimized solutions is so rewarding when you finally figure them out. Great music, fun little cutscenes and dialogue. If you like this sort of game or the original, it's a no-brainer. Buy it."
317,2588,"A really fun game for the wannabe programmer. Cute, smart and funny."
318,2586,"Programming game, roughly a multi-processing version of ""Human Resource Machine"" (play that game first).8/10 for the humor and interesting solutions. Minus a point or two for timing and collision questions, and some of the puzzles might be a little too easy for the main storyline. Flow can get a little tricky to follow, but the more optimal solutions are better than those in Human Resource Machine. Recommended."
319,2584,"Great game and great sequel. This one is far more difficult, in my opinion, so I would definitely recommend playing Human Resource Machine before this one.It's all logic just like the first one and there are many ways to solve the basic stuff.It has the same challenges as the first game, but this uses a bit more advanced techniques, You'll need to have an understanding of IF, AND, OR, XOR............ etc. or you'll have a hard time just starting.I'll reiterate that you should play the first one thoroughly before this one or you'll probably get stuck pretty quick.If you liked the first game then you'll love this one! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
320,2583,"Interesting puzzle game and I might just be stupid, but its very hard."
321,2583,"I loved the ""a-ha"" moments that this game gave me. I am a computer programmer, and the two special challenges per level (shortest program and fastest execution) made me wake up some mornings with a new fun solution to try. On the PC, the click/drag scrolling was sometimes annoying, so I found myself copying the programs and editing them in a text editor (which is a nice ability). The art, music, and dark sarcastic style gave the game a nice tone."
322,2583,Makes my head hurt in the best way possible.
323,2583,Very funny game and it gets really complex. Not just fun for computer scientist but also people interrested in logic challenges.
324,2583,You'll soon learn the pains of programming in Assembly.
325,2583,10/10
326,2583,Expands on what Human Resource Machine got right.
327,2583,"Great sequel to Human Resource Machine, the parallelism is a really nice next step. The optimizations are a fun way to improve or change your solutions."
328,2583,Just as infuriating as actual programming.
329,2582,This game is good for helping you practice logic and progamming very fun
330,2582,"A worthy successor to ""Human Resource Machine"" with the same great humor and more persons to ""program"" in parallel. And everybody knows more people = more fun :D"
331,2582,"This game is just as much fun as their first game, highly recommend."
332,2582,fun
333,2582,Fun game if you want to work on some basic programming skills
334,2582,nice little puzzle game.

336,2582,what a great game
337,2582,Human Resource Machine + multiple processes
338,2582,"Spend all day coding, come home and spend all night playing this. Immensely fun!"
339,2582,good
340,2582,"Such Code, Many Humans. Kill them all, start again. 10/10"
341,2582,"Best game for programmers or puzzle game lovers. What you are doing in this game is drag and drop programming in a really fun way. Game teaches you the basics and gets progressively harder and more interesting. You can do each solution ""your way"" so in essence this game forces creativity out of you BY not forcing you to do something in a linear path - you are free to do anything your way.Beating optional challenges can be a real mind twister. Great game!10/10."
342,2582,Accurate representation of corporate work.
343,2582,"If you're into programming, you'll enjoy this game.If you're new to programming, this is a fairly fun way to learn some basics and hopefully teach you a couple things which may help with classes"
344,2582,",."
345,2582,"Excellent puzzles, excellent aesthetic"
346,2582,"This is a fantastic game!If you have played Human Resource Machine, and enjoyed it, I highly recommend this game.However, if you are interested in this game but have never played, or heard of Human Resource Machine, go check it out first before getting this game."
347,2582,10/10 fantastic
348,2582,Definitely a good way to get yourself introduced to programming with a difficulty that ramps up exponentially in my personal opinion.
349,2582,Great and interesting programming game with sarcastic humour in the style of World of Goo.Update: after a time hard as hell :D
350,2582,"Do you know how to code? Yeah, me neither, welcome aboard. If you like open-ended logic puzzles where creativity is king, and are ready to climb the corporate ladder in a lifelong grind towards the heavens of higher management, you might just enjoy this."
351,2582,Great
352,2582,"Its a programming puzzle game, fuelled with abundant dark humour.  If that is at all attractive to you, you'll find enough initial ease and ultimate complexity to keep you entertained for hours.  If you get stuck, there is a large and helpful community."
353,2582,Such a great pseudo-programming game. Great graphics.
354,2582,"If you are looking for game, where you must think logically and a little like programmer it's perfect game for you.Must have if you liked Human Resource Machine."
355,2582,"Fun game that while won't make a quite good programmer think too much, can be a great way for others to learn problem solving and simple programming. Its easy, fun and with those delightful animations and textures that made World of Goo so cute. Definitely a worthwhile purchase."
356,2582,"After Human Resource Machine, which ist about programming, this game extend to parallel programming. You write one piece of code and every little human follows.It is harder than the first part, but you were lead through many levels, learning new techniques."
357,2582,tired of seeing trump in games
358,2582,"If you love programming, then this is the game for you. It starts very simple but gets harder as you go along. Only spent around 2 hours and enjoying it at the moment."
359,2582,good
360,2581,"Nice little game. If making calculations, loops and command lines meets your concept of great entertainment, this game may offer some amusement for a while."
361,2578,Makes me feel like a genius when it's not making me feel like a cow
362,2576,A great game that you should definitely play if you enjoy programming.
363,2576,-WHY DID I BUY THIS I'M TERRIBLE AT ALGORITHAMS-MATH IT UP FUZZBALL-FINAL BOSS IS JUST THE ENTIRE NUMBER THING OF PI GOOD LUCK-MURDER OF COURSE-SYNCHRONIZED LINES
364,2575,a delightful challenge
365,2574,"Maybe the best purchase this year (I also bought Dark Souls 3) with a very nice comic design.The best I've seen so far regarding very funny games full of algorithms.Thanks to the optional challenges even demanding if you are experienced with programming.Mostly like that:Start""Just a few more minutes, the next idea has to be the ultrafast solution... naaah it crashed. Maybe if I change this...""Jump to Start"
366,2574,Gets very hard very quickly so satisfying when you finally solve the puzzle
367,2574,"I write code for a living, so I thought finishing a ""programming"" game couldn't be that hard. Boy was I wrong !It made me tie my brain into knots for hours in a surprisingly pleasant way. My only regret is that there aren't any more levels.Plus, the graphic design & subtle hints of humor are like the icing on the cake.10/10 would totally recommend (and I did)"
368,2573,They did it again ... The funniest way to learn programming.
369,2572,"If you enjoy programming, want to get in to it or just love a good puzzle - this game is for you. It's like having a textbook made in to a game with excellent humor and lovable characters."
370,2571,"This is a spiritual sequel to another game, Human Resource Machine, by the same company, though they are two separate coding games that you can play in any order (though for people new to coding, Human Resource Machine is a better starting place). You use drag-and-drop code to control multiple workers (unlike HRM where you only controlled one person), to pick up items, drop them, and occasionally plunge them off cliffs or order them to jump into shredders. All of the levels have optional goals of using the fewest number of steps or the least lines of code for added challenge. Because you have to control multiple works using the same code, yet sometimes have the workers do different tasks, it requires a lot of lateral thinking to get them to work independently, which is an added challenge. The artwork is cartoonish, and it has a doofy premise where robots have taken over the planet and put all humans out of a job...so humans get put to work doing the monotonous, routine tasks for the robots.Overall, if you enjoy coding for ridiculously dumb reasons, this game is for you. Or if you want to learn coding logic, play Human Resource Machine and then play this one."
371,2570,great sequel
372,2569,"It is absolutely hilarious! Fun and educational, what more can you ask?"
373,2564,"Your workers have done something (making debugging impossible and giving intentionally vague feedback) that makes this scenario (giving a positive review) now impossible, start over!"
374,2563,Very nice game to learn you in a funny way the basics of programming.
375,2563,A much more challenging sequel of Human Resource Machine. Does an excellent job of teaching and visualizing random walks and parallel programming.
376,2562,"One of those on the fence reviews.This isn't a real game, its a practice for people who want to learn coding/syntax logic in a fun and quirky environment.I recommend getting on sale (like i did)"
377,2562,"An excellent sequel to the, very fun, Human Resource Machine, now with parallel programming."
378,2562,"I don't really know if this is a Puzzle gameOr if its a teaching tool.Honestly, you could consider it either, it does a fantastic job showcasing basic modern programming for practically every language, nothing gets too specific although due to this you have to start using more round-a-bout methods for more complex ""functions"" but it does get challenging, very challenging.If you like programming, or think you might enjoy it, for whatever reasongive it a shot!"
379,2561,Great challenges. I had a lot of fun.
380,2561,"My Brain hurts. Already spent twice as long as I did on the first game (I got all the achievements on HRM). I just now did my last puzzle without the optional stuff on this one. It's fun. I sorely miss some sort of cut and paste of blocks of code after entering an over 100 step solution multiple times (my thinking was wrong). it is fun grinding up the workers and sending them down the pits really gets some of that aggravation out. Perhaps these guys play angry humans. I'll keep at it until the i get my 100%, Just not tonight. I have to get up in the morning so I can write programs at work. without the cute little helpers."
381,2561,"Absolutely addicting. Missing some quality of life upgrades to make playing smoother, however."
382,2561,Neat little game. BUT HOLY  SOME OF THE CHALLENGES ARE HARD AF
383,2561,If you want something to make you relax this is the game for you
384,2560,"One of the most comprehensible, accessible & funny programming game I ever tried. Yet offer good challenge and side objectives for the hardcore gamers."
385,2560,A wonderful entree into the world of programming.Clever satire wrapped around basic programming design puzzles.  I'm astonished there are 30 reviews to date in 6mo of release.  Have been of Zachtronic-style engineering-problem puzzle games and this one holds a unique spot.  Sure to be underrated.  Fully worth it at full price.
386,2560,"Awesome puzzle game, even as someone who was never very good at programming despite studying CS in college. I've always been a big fan of 2D Boy/Tomorrow Corporation since the World of Goo days. World of Goo was my favorite game as a kid, I wish they'd release a sequel."
387,2560,Got a job in Google after playing this game. 10/10 would buy again
388,2558,I enjoyed this game. Playing it almost allowed me to forget that I failed the only programming course I took in University.
389,2558,Great game!Although I mistakenly pressed the x button next to my profile and deleted all my work in 2 seconds!
390,2557,"The game is great, but seriously, a volume control setting cannot be that hard to program"
391,2557,"A nice follow up to Human Resource Machine. It uses a new programming language that challenges you by using multiple workers simultaneously at parallel processors. It is a nice twist on the original concept, and a worthy follow up. I would recommend Human Resource Machine over this one slightly just because it is a tighter package, but if you have already played HRM, pick this one up. You won't be dissapointed."
392,2557,"After four hours into 7 Billion Humans I feel too stupid to even finish the purple path, let alone optimization, but I'm grateful enough to leave a positive review. I like the game for its really difficult puzzles, which mostly have several solutions, but the best one is always tricky. It aroused my interest in programming: I am 28 and have just enrolled on Harvard's CS50. Perhaps, one really needs IT classes to beat the game. There's hardly a puzzle this smartif you know one, please share in the comments."
393,2557,"Finally, I beat the game.I like this ending.:)"
394,2557,"I like it a lot better than the first game. The tasks seem a lot more varied an interesting this time around.I really enjoyed the wacky artstyle and the funny cutscenes. The whole game has a very whimsical vibe to it.As for complaints, It's kind of frustrating that there's an undo button, but no redo button. And no keyboard shortcuts. It only became a problem for me in the later levels though.If you like programming games, I think you'll enjoy this game. I certainly had fun with it."
395,2556,I wonder how many players tried to pick up the plants in the corner at first in level Year 1p.s. to dear developer I'm Chinese and I want to help in Chinese translation  for some funny talks I need Google Translate
396,2556,yeah it's alright
397,2556,"This game is all about programming logic.  If you want to try some programming puzzles with a humorous theme, this is a great game for you.  I had a lot of fun with it and the theme makes me giggle a bit."
398,2555,"The game play is good. The quests in game are great and teach you a bit about programming and they do a good job of challenging the mind. My biggest problem is that it seems like the company just took Human Resource Machine, slapped a few new graphics and a new name on it and re-released it. In that regard I'm dissapointed. It's a great game if you have never played Human Resource Machine, if you have however, you will be much dissapointed."
399,2555,"Positives:1) Amazing art style combined with a some humorous moments provide a very pleasant overall atmosphere.2) Appropriate range of difficulties - the game can be enjoyed by casual players while trying to tie the best known solutions can be challenging even for experienced programmers. You can also skip up to 5 levels at a time.3) If you want an extra challenge, you can try to tie or beat the current world record - the players on the forum keep track of those.4) The game achieves a very good balance between explaining the mechanics and letting the players explore the details on their own.5) You won't encounter any bugs in the first ~150 hours, and ones that are present are pretty minor and easily avoidable.Negatives:1) Lack of proper sound controls.2) Some parts of the game run slower than they need to, for example the automated tests don't take full advantage of your PC's computational resources.3) Lost opportunity: A level editor + Steam Workshop could easily quadruple the fun, but the developers decided to not do it.In conclusion, the positives outweigh the negatives by an order of magnitude. If you enjoy puzzle games, then this one is a must play."
400,2555,Very enjoyable... and challenging.The game provides a logical progression through the different concepts of programming.
401,2555,"Love these developers. Been aware of them since 08 'World of Goo' when they were 2D Boy games i think it was. 7 billion Humans is similarly cute and quirky like WOG was . It starts out somewhat difficult, but when you get to the later levels you'll realize those first levels were like learning to walk. I was near the end and somehow i loaded the game in Spanish. Admist the confusion I accidently deleted my save. Hit the power switch on PC right away lol, but it was gone so I did it all over again. 10/10 great casual game."
402,2555,"If you liked Human Resource Machine then you will love this.You can get trough the story in under 8 hours if you already are good at programming. But finishing it 100% or getting all the extra goals is a lot longer even if you are good. There is no single best way to beat levels, you are free to aproach it any way you want, some of the thousands of possible solutions are simply more optimal than others."
403,2555,Good puzzle game!
404,2555,"Some of the puzzles feel unfair, mainly because you have to coordinate different humans doing different operations but there's no clear yardstick for how long those operations take. That can lead to a lot of frustration where something that feels like a valid solution falls apart because of timing: How were you supposed to know that a ""Calc"" instruction takes more time than a ""Pick Up"" instruction? Contrast it to EXAPUNKS, where every instruction takes 1 cycle and you can burn excess cycles using the NOOP instruction. EXAPUNKS is challenging, but you always feel rewarded when you think a puzzle through. By contrast, 7 Billion Humans sometimes makes you guess what kind of solution the developers had in mind.Still, on the whole, this is a fun programming game and a worthy sequel to Human Resource Machine. Just don't feel embarrassed if you have to look up some of the puzzle solutions on YouTube."
405,2554,"Plenty of fun, levels, puzzles and brain workouts. A very well thought-out and unique style. The game has its own programming language. But it is not compelling enough to make it enjoyable for experienced programmers."
406,2553,"I 100% this game in 11 hours of purchasing. I was away from my keyboard for part of that time aswell, so... yeah."
407,2551,"This game is arguably much more challenging than Human Resources Machine.  As seen in the game, they now allow some failures but still pass your solution.  Just remember:  Multi-tasking is very different from simple sequential programming."
408,2551,Totally worth it!
409,2551,"Good game, fair price, though it doesn't add too much to the concept of Human Resource Machine. But, if you liked that game and want more drag-and-drop programming goodness, grab it for sure."
410,2551,"Great game, if you liked HRM you'll love this."
411,2551,fun
412,2551,A very good pseudo-programming game. Very fun even for non-programmers!
413,2551,Is good. Me write review for badge procurement reasons.
414,2551,Game of the year nominee..
415,2551,This is a fun little programming puzzle game. Very similar to or a spiritual successor to human resource machine. If you like logic puzzles then this game is for you.
416,2551,"If you liked Human Resource Machine, you'll love 7 Billion Humans. Fantastic programming puzzles in a cute art style with silly commentaries. Be warned though: you'll be thinking about how to solve those pesky challenges all day and night! :P"
417,2551,"In this game you give instructions to a bunch of little dudes so they can complete your goal for each level.  It's a game about programming but with a fun packaging and a light background story. It will challenge you  and make you think using a certain form of logic but it's a nice and pleasing challenge and you can avoid the harder puzzles.In brief, it's a pretty cool game."
418,2551,"If you liked Human Resource Machine, this is 7 billion times even better."
419,2551,top notch
420,2551,"7 Billion Humans is a wonderful ""sequel"" to Human Resource Machine. The challenges start out very easy but the difficulty curve is satisfying, if a little unforgiving to people with little or no programming experience. The optimization challenges add a nice bonus, and optional levels bring more difficult options into the mix for a little extra difficulty. On top of it all, the charming art style makes this game a wonderful final product that I would 100% recommend to anyone who enjoys programming or logic puzzles."
421,2551,"Here we go again, telling mindless humans how to do their job properly.The perfect sequel of Human Resource Machine."
422,2550,"Another great programming puzzle game. Makes you have to think in parallel but isn't as harsh as some others. There's multiple ways to approach almost every level. For the most part eases you in to most of the features, and if you get frustrated with a level you can skip it and come back to it later."
423,2550,"If you want to teach yourself programming, you'll love it. If you are working as a programmer already, and you want to relax after work, you'll hate it, because it's just more programming."
424,2550,Pros:- ArtsyCons:I'm not a good programmer.10/10 would play again.
425,2550,"This is a fantastic programming puzzle game with enough complexity to make you think, but not too much to be overwhelming. Do not be intimidated if you have no programming experience."
426,2550,Shoo-in for the the Most Fun with a Machine award
427,2550,A fun puzzle game.
428,2550,The Most Fun with a Machine Award
429,2550,
430,2550,Excellent game to learn coding ... even if you know coding it will be a challenge to complete the optimization in every level
431,2549,"It's Human Resource Machine, now with multithreading! And more variety!This game features a new programming language which is more ""high level"" instead of being directly analogous to machine code like in the first game. Simple tasks using nearby tiles are easier, but navigating to a specific tile is much harder. More importantly, the multithreading turns everything on its head. You have to account for several people executing the same code at once, and/or have a worker detect at the start that they should be shunted off to a different loop.There's a lot more variety in the available commands and the tasks you're asked to solve. Maybe a third of the levels are math-based as opposed to nearly all in the first game, and there's always a position component. I found the puzzles in this game MUCH harder than the first game, especially the later levels.The plot's a bit of a downgrade, but dialog is still pretty funny. And you can click on every worker to learn a little something about them, which is neat.Overall, a very worthy sequel to the first game. I would recommend playing them in order, the first game is trying to trick you into learning the fundamentals while this game is trying to trick you into learning more advanced concepts."
432,2549,"This is very similar to Tomorrow Corporation's last game Human Resource Machine, but where are that was more conserned with memory operations with a single person, 7 Billion Humans is more about multy threaded tasks by allowing you to write a large program for lots of people and then have them all assist in completing the task. If you have been doing computer programming for a while you will breeze through this game. The drag and drop programming interface is cool and I haven't seen any other programming simulation game attempt to cover multithreaded programming before.3/5"
433,2549,"Tomorrow Corporation took everything that made Human Resource Machine great and turned it up to 11! I absolutely love the humor of this game. Made me giggle lots of times. And no, you're not supposed to pick up a printer. :D"
434,2547,Not an easy challenge. Expect to spend many weekends designing and optimizing code. Amazing soundtrack tho and the puzzles keep you coming back for more.
435,2546,Good game to emulate programming
436,2546,Very good follow up of Human Resource Machine. I liked the more programmy feel.
437,2545,Are you a logician? Or maybe a budding programmer? Or maybe an experienced programmer who loves shredding office workers? If so.... buy this game! It's great fun
438,2545,"Just amazing. If you played Human Ressource Machine and liked it you probably already know you'll love this one. If not you may want to try that first, instead. Getting the hang of programming your little agent before getting into coordinating multiple agents, synchronization issues, etc. is probably a good idea. If you jump straight into the game the problems will probably still be solvable just fine, but your learning curve will be somewhat steeper.The concept is the same as in HRM and randomness now which allows for fancy ""almost certainly solves the problem"" solutions - especially fun when optimizing for size. Unfortunately the time limit is somewhat low - I would've wished for a higher speedup-factor when playing it and some higher bar on the runtime in exchange. Also the ""parallelism"" is weirdish: all agents run in lockstep which makes up for some very awkward solutions in OCD land that simply shouldn't work.Solutions only have to work 50% of the time allowing for speed optimization by not working in cases that'd be slow - something that turned out to be really fun when squeezing out some extra seconds. Unfortunately getting those deliberately non-robust solutions accepted by the game is somewhat tedious. First you have to be somewhat lucky in the run you're making. Second after getting a run through it forces the RNG to a seed that failed until you pass again which forces you to run some other solution in between.Finally at some points it would've been nice to set breakpoints while debugging - maybe in the next game.Gameplay aside the visuals and sounds are absolutely lovely. And the cutscenes with their little story even more so.As usual with Tomorrow Corporation: I didn't run into any bugs whatsoever! (I played all their games.)All things considered I had a blast while playing and don't regret getting this at full price at all - 9.5/10Note: I'm a professional programmer with over a decade of experience. If you have little to no programming experience you should probably not try to OCD the game as some of those challanges are *really* hard. Even so you may have quite some fun solving the puzles."
439,2545,Amazing. I like the humor!
440,2543,"Great game!Really enjoyed the puzzles and the soundtrack.I was happy to see that the difficulty level was raised since Human Resource Machine and more levels were added.Enjoyed every single thing about the game except the horrible Polish translation,which seems to have been done using Bing Translator...But unless you exclusively speak Polish, you're good! o3ob"
441,2542,"Good game, with puzzles ranging from very easy to extremely difficult. Due to the more limited commands I would even argue that this is harder than EXAPUNKS or TIS-100Only complaint is that randomization isn't communicated very well - e.g. some boxes are obviously random, some boxes are obviously static, and other boxes change between different tests and you have no way of knowing that until you produce a solution that depends on the values and fails on some of the test runs. Similarly, you are never really told if maze-like levels always have the same layout so you have to work it out by trial and error. A way to step through the possible test cases (e.g. like you can in EXAPUNKS) would be much appreciated."
442,2542,This game seems to blur the lines between my inherent sadism and my inherited stupidity
443,2541,Put an option for completely muting the game. I want to play while listening to music or a speech.
444,2541,One of us one of us *brzzt*
445,2541,"Initial impressions so far: Excellent in every aspect except one - I understand the need to simplify the game but please at least add a hardcore mode with more realistic multi process logic. I'm able to get away with some algorithms that would be disastrous in real life (e.g. processes seem to deterministically run sequentially). If you do, I'll change the review to positive, print out a T-shirt, and promote your game everywhere I go :)"
446,2541,A absolut worthy successor to Human Resource Machine. Challenging in the end trying to get all Achievements. Big thanks for the Linux Version and the update with cloud storage support!
447,2541,"Excellent just like Human Resource Machine was, and renew the interest. I just wish the storyline of robots/humans was deeper."
448,2541,I really enjoy this game.  The stretch challenges are fun.The only disappointment is that it doesn't do steam saves.  And it's so small that seems like it should be easy.[Months later and they added cloud saves - woo!]
449,2540,Cute
450,2540,I can't feel the Computer Science degree inside me anymore.
451,2540,"If your thinking about buying this game, wait no further and buy it. I heard about this game from a friend of mine, and as someone who dabbles in programing, I love this game. Its fun and easy, for the beginers but later you unlock tasks that challenge you to complete the scripts with fewer lines of code or to execute it faster. The game is solid whether your a seasoned programmer just learning or even if you have no background writing code. The humor is sly and the mechanics are solid. TLDR: Buy the game its 9/10"
452,2540,"Very challenging. I was fine for most levels until around the end. You have to make sure not to over complicate the solution in your mind and if a solution isn't working, don't be afraid to try and completely new solution. The optional challenges can be quite a pain, I've got this challenge where it needs to be beated in 50 seconds or less but I'm stuck on 51 seconds. Highly recommended"
453,2540,7 Billion Humans is great game for teaching yourself to code.  It makes you think outside the box. Sometimes the answers aren't as they seem.
454,2540,"It has some good ideas.I enjoy games like this, but would point out a couple of things that might throw people off.There are no settings to speak of: No resolution options, no volume sliders, only thing you can toggle is full screen and music. Even if you toggle off the music you will hear a humming brown noise sort of thing at any volume.The forced long drawn speech bubbles are more a nuisance than anything, and the cutscenes are an autoskip for me every time.I can live with these thing, but there are some frustrating things in terms of the gameplay and teaching thereof. Some things are just not explained or counter intuitive if you know programming even. Like their IF modules, you can have AND and OR combinations, but how that works make no sense really, it's not order specific and there are no explanation for how it determines what makes sense. Nor are there parentheses. So if you are trying to make something simple and short happen, you might like me end up fighting the approach used more than trying to solve the puzzle.You can of course attempt to do it in other ways in which case your solution becomes a mess.It's fine having challenges, but the game promotes fairly simple solutions to fairly complex puzzles with no guidance, I would almost say it doesn't feel quite polished.I hope some updates come in the future to give people proper options, and that allow a better help system, because as a programmer I find it like having to write AI in BASIC but only have 15 lines of code available to me at times.I would recommend it, though I find the 12 EUR maybe a little much when games much more complex are less than this, but it's cheap anyway so I guess that's alright."
455,2540,"If you liked 'human resource machine' you will definitely going to love this one! The programming challenges are based on parallel programming. You provide the instructions via a limited programming language, the features of which can change per puzzle. There are points for solving the puzzle, having the smallest program and having the fastest program.Highly recommended!"
456,2540,"10/10, Would OCD again"
457,2540,"No volume settings, sounds play at full volume.No operator priority in conditional statements.Otherwise not bad."
458,2540,"This is a great puzzle game, not just a new level pack for Human Resource Machine.Puzzles feel less fiddly.  In Human Resource Machine, eventually there were puzzles that felt like they would only be solvable to someone who had done enough programming to recognize the pattern that they should use.7 Billion Humans looks similar visually, but feels like discovering problem-solving algorithms rather than playing with memory/iteration semantics.  Very satisfying."
459,2540,"Full Review --   Curator Site Video Review: https://youtu.be/_3g2wxqNR-k7 Billion Humans is the latest from Tomorrow Corporation, who have developed Human Resource Machine and World of Goo previous to this. Both of those games are unique and interesting concepts, so does 7 Billion Humans live up to that legacy? Lets take a look.7 Billion Humans starts by informing the player that robots have taken all their jobs, and its the age of the singularity, and we have benevolent robot overlords who make everyones lives easier and let them do what they want. But humans want jobs and as such the robots, including a really obvious but humorous political caricature, gives all the human jobs.So all 7 billion humans are told to show up for their jobs at a monolithic office building. This is just a simplistic storyline for why humans are following orders from the player and their robot overlords but it works and is a bit humorous. In fact, the game does have a good sense of humor, and there are a number of scenes that made me laugh.The core of the game, however, is instructing humans how to solve simplistic tasks such as lining up data cubes, writing new data cubes, using printers and shredders and more. The player is limited in how they can instruct the humans, and the game slowly gives the player more and more instructions with which to write their scripts.So yes, this is a programming game, and a sequel to Human Resource Machine, but unlike Zachtronics games and others where you are writing programs, 7 Billion Humans tackles programming in a different way. The interface is similar to Scratch programming, a drag and drop language where programmers dont have to really understand the program themselves, they instead just order the instructions and the correct code is generated behind the scenes. Here, its the same, if you want your humans to step to the right, pick up an object, and then drop it, you drag and drop each instruction into your program in order and the humans will follow those orders until they reach the end of the program or an end instruction.The drag and drop interface makes the game a bit more user-friendly, but personally, I always feel like the enjoyment I have in them becomes tedium before the end, as there are so many steps Im required to drag and drop into place. Sadly, 7 Billion Humans isnt an exception here. Once I reach 20-30 commands in a program it creates that tedium, but even when its early in the game and I have to do four different conditional statements, I feel like I want to have the ability to copy and paste a single block of code, rather than the entire code block.The tasks the game require you to solve are interesting at first. There are simple tasks such as picking up a block and moving it down two spaces, or lining up all the datacubes (which are representations of information). However as the game goes on, I found myself returning to old levels often to copy a solution and then return to the current level to paste that solution in. It wouldnt solve the levels, but many of the solutions were 95 percent complete in a previous level, and only a small change is being asked for. When it happened in EXAPUNKS, I found myself to enjoy the experience because I was using a small amount of my code (Around 30 percent) that had already been optimized, and theres a new addition to the problem that requires almost double the code to solve the additional problem. In 7 Billion Humans, I found Im mostly reusing the majority of code because Im being asked to do something similar with a small twist.The good news though is 7 Billion Humans pushes multithreading, hard. Where Human Resource Machine was a similar game to 7 Billion Humans, Human Resource Machine focused on a single human. Every level of 7 Billion Humans contains more than one human. In the early part of the game, they can each run their own script and ignore the other workers. Once the game gets going though theyll eventually have to look for other workers, run synchronized programs, and eventually communicate with each other.The unfortunate fact though is the multithreading is limited to that. There are the ability to observe other workers, and passing objects between them, and even simple wait for communication instructions, but theres nothing beyond that. The ability to communicate without halting execution until communication occurs doesnt exist here and it limits the problem space that can be handled by the game.That doesnt mean there are not good puzzles here, its just that theres a limit to the complexity of them to the point that many of the final problems have very short code, and rather simplistic multithreading. Theres also the problem of randomized code here, where a few floors require a solution that relies on randomized instructions, and honestly, I found those puzzles to be more frustrating than worthwhile.Its not that I hate 7 Billion Humans or the puzzles involved in it. Its just that it doesnt reach a depth of code where I can say I felt that rewarded with my solutions, especially near the end of the game. I dont want to spoil some of the final tasks, and a couple of the final puzzles are very clever. However the final puzzles felt a touch too easy for my taste, and I could have gone with something a little more challenging at that point in the game.Having finished the majority of the 68 levels in under 7 hours, I wonder if it was a situation where my skills as a programmer tipped the scales in my favor, and I believe that could be part of the problem, however I feel that games like 7 Billion Humans is already aimed at those of us who enjoy programming. So its a game that wants programmers but only will challenge the beginners in the field. A shame the game is so laser targeted at that group because its such an enjoyable game as you play it.I then turned to the idea of optimization to play a little more, but ultimately I didnt find optimizing programs here as rewarding as I expected. The game does have very reasonable lower limits, and in fact the player is able to even go below the optimized goal at times, however most of these programs are rather short, and knowing theres a 10 instruction lower limit, when your program is only 11 instructions, usually means theres an obvious extra instruction (often I needed to remove an else statement).At the end of the day, I finish 7 Billion Humans, and I struggle to judge it. It is a programming game, and I admit those are a niche category, but I also look at my enjoyment with it, and I realize that I have just reviewed a second programming game, EXAPUNKS, and I wonder if part of the reason I struggle to really find the same love of 7 Billion Humans, is due to playing a different game right before it. Its definitely possible.If you want to read more and see a final score, you can see the full review with pictures and video athttps://kinglink-reviews.com/2018/09/06/7-billion-humans-review/.

460,2540,Incredible good game. But its really difficult at some times.
461,2539,A really great game. It has a great comcept and is very easy to understand. It gives a good insight in programming too.
462,2539,"It's good and all, but it's not as good as e.g. Zachtronics' games -- although it is probably better for beginners. If you are going to get it, I'd recommend getting it on Switch or other touchpad devices, as the click-and-drag interface is a bit annoying on PC."
463,2539,"At first I thought I woudln't like it as it sounded like too much work and close to my day job, but it's a puzzle game with the highest entertainment value."
464,2539,Do you like puzzles and great music?This is your game! What are you waiting for? Youre going to be late for work!
465,2539,"So far seems quite fun, and a good successor to Human Resource Machine.BUT WHY IN THE BLOODY  SHOULD I DIG THROUGH SETTINGS FILES JUST TO CHANGE THE BLOODY VOLUME!THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN A MENU YOU LAZY BASTARDS!This wouldn't even have been such an issue IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE DEFAULT VOLUMES THAT TRY COMPETE WITH MUSIC CONCERTS AND JACKHAMMERS!"
466,2539,A great logic game with lots of personality and humor. Helps you think like a programmer using limited tools.
467,2539,"I bought this because the trailer made me laugh. If you like games that make you think, this is for you. I'm about halfway through the game as of writing this review.So far, there isn't a steady increase in difficulty. Instead it gets more difficult until they introduce a new ability or item, which causes it noticeably to scale the difficulty back. After one or 2 scenarios with a new item the difficulty creeps back up. Aside from trying to solve the scenarios, there is some humor sprinkled throughout the game. If you liked what you saw in the trailer, then you will like the humor in the game."
468,2539,"This is more feedback to the devs than a review.I really like this game and find it very enjoyable, especially the challenges.Since it is so new, and the devs are reading the reviews, this is a great chance to make the game even more enjoyable.In my opinion there needs to be a few additions and changes to improve the playability, especially if solving the challenges is important to the player.A real time cycle counter, or at least seconds counter to monitor progress without having to run the level to the endto see if there is any improvement.Breakpoints.The ability to step back in the code, like in Human Resource machine.The ability to turn off the moving background graphics, leaves crossing the playing area for example or rain.An easy way to skip the end of run speech, without clicking the mouse 7 times or so, I don't mean pressing the escape buttonwhich does that, I know.Detachment of the undo button from the code window, so it doesn't leap up and down out of reachof the mouse after every undo with longer code. I can't even see where the undo actually happened, and can't keep trackof what has been changed either.Speed slider could also be clickable and not just draggable."
469,2539,Great little game about programming. As someone with zero programing knowledge I would recomend to start with the first game; Human resource machine as the difficulty in this one escilates quickly. That being said it is well worth the money.
470,2539,A huge step up from the Human Resource Machine. Highly recommended.+ A lot more levels than HRM+ Much less tedious coding experience+ Works great under Linux- No cloud save feature
471,2539,"Here a quick review:Target group:People who like to code. I personally did not learn coding, so everything is self-tought. Despite that I have coded some things before in different coding languages for fun. If you consider buying this game, either you should have written some lines of code before, be a programmer (if you like the optimization challenges), or buy the predecessor HRM first which had a slower learning curve and was therefore (at least in my opinion) easier.How long is the gameplay:This obviously depends on your skill level. I have finished the game/main story in barely under 15 hours - without skipping levels or looking up solutions. I did optimize some levels for fun in the beginning and have yet to do about 4-5 ""Side-Quest-Levels"". For me this took one week because I only played about 2h every evening - then my brain needed a break. The gameplay time can be immensely increased by optimizing all 60+ levels (If this is something you enjoy - great!)Gameplay:I personally would have liked the game to get a bit more complex in the end. The second-last duplication-level took me 2 days to sleep over the solution to get it. What a great feeling to have it finally solved, but after that...game finished... If there is to be a part 3, I would be thrilled to have to use For-loops in more variety and most of all procedures. Of course one can make it more complex by optimizing but for me the main fun is to ""get it working somehow, only holding together by duct tape"". But this exactly is the great thing about this game: You are allowed to do this - there is nothing stopping you to send 8 workers to rest and let one guy do the job if it is working in a reasonable time span (By the way: There should be an achievement for ""We can't wait all day for your program to finish""). Be creative and do it your way - or be skilled enough to challenge yourself with the optimizations.Story,  Music:As in HRM - The story is pointless and fun, just what I expected - great. The music is just perfect, no need for a volume slider to turn it down.Recommendation:If (you like to code and already played HRM and enjoyed HRM) {Buy it; No-brainer };Else: My recommendation would be to start with HRM and afterwards buy and play this great game!"
472,2539,"A good puzzle game. The game is more interesting, fun and diversified than the first game, Human Resource Machine. The gameplay is adapted to everyone: whether you are used to programming or not, there is a progressive learning of the different aspects of the game. For neophytes, some levels may discourage them, not counting the challenges (maximum number of lines and time challenge), but if you take the time to solve a level, it's not insurmountable. We can go through levels and come back later. In the worst cases, the discussion forum is active and there is already a guide with all the solutions.For people who are used to programming: don't worry, some levels require a good understanding of the environment of each level, otherwise you will stay stuck (parallel programming). Many of the levels may seem simple, but it's the challenges that interest you."
473,2539,"Great game! As always from this studio, enjoyed a lot!"
474,2539,"Every time I calculate 2+2, something seems to explode.Smashed through the challenges to the finale far quicker than I expected to, some puzzles were optimised on the way, if I were to go back and aim for the optimisation challenge I am sure I could easily triple my playtime, but I would prefer there were workshop puzzles! if (pram ; istrue = computernerd)1001/1010elseNulPuzzles were far more accessable than Shenzhen I/O, would recommend to anyone with basic understanding of programming logic and wants a fun way to practice, or anyone who just wants to learn from scratch if they have had no prior experience. Probably too basic for professional code monkeys to enjoy."
475,2538,"I did parallel programming at a post-grad level many years ago, and apparently I've forgotten ALL of it.If you liked Human Resource Machine, you'll like this.  As before some of the 'stretch goals' are punishing, and not always contemporaneous (A short program isn't necessarily a quick program, and vice versa), but that's all part of the fun.I'm going to be a while getting to all of them."
476,2538,INPUT: 7 billion humansOPERATION: solve threading puzzlesOUTPUT: 0 humansCongratulations! Humanity is now extinct! * EVIL LAUGHTER *
477,2538,"Being a programmer myself I initially very enjoyed this game but very fast I realized that this game is not focused on building perfect algorithms in general. It is focused for building a particular solution for a specific situation. In some cases it is ""better"" to just hardcode commands e.g ""left left left down right"" instead of building of a conditional solution that will work in all cases.Not fun anymore."
478,2538,What a great little game! 100% recommend for anywone who at least has programming curiosity.
479,2538,I'm too stupid for this game but it is a lot of fun
480,2538,Great fun trying to figure out each one.  Figured one out while sleeping .. Crazy game had me coding in my sleep.10/10  wish it was longer
481,2538,"A solid programming puzzle game. You can find some challenge in this game but I feel like the games main flaw is the starting levels can be mind numbingly easy for people who can solve the later levels and the later levels would be too much of a challenge for people who need the early levels.  I can agree with why this progression is necessary to teach the players, but at the same time I feel like there should be a ""I'm experienced"" option to skip the early levels.Also the idea that the foreach command can find a square with nothing in it and then telling the human to step to that square with nothing does nothing is a baffling decision. Nothing should be a coordinate, not literally null."
482,2538,"If you played Human Resource Machine and enjoyed it, i'd recommend picking this up.If you played Human Resource Machine and enjoyed it but thought it was a little too difficult, still may be worth the shot.I think the biggest change from HRM to 7 Billion Humans is that the difficulty curve is a lot shallower, in the sense that it introduces you to new concepts slowly and makes sure you have them down before moving, it's a much smoother transition from simple puzzles to complex puzzles.I love the new style as well with the little swarms of humans running around instead of an individual. It's a joy to watch all of them scramble to fulfill your commands.A word of warning to people who want to pick this up to learn programming; the concepts are similar but the programming language used in this isn't anything used today, so it's not a substitute for actually learning something like Python. That said if you want a fun puzzle game that implements many of the general concepts from programming, this is a great one."

484,2538,"I have not finished, but this game is great.I played through all of human resource machine, and optimized a lot of the solutions for size and time.I have written software for over 30 years, mostly paid to do it.  And I still found this fun.  My software doesn't result in people walking into shredders when it fails to work, which is a pretty good feature...in a game ;)I love the added challenge of having to move my workers around the ""map"" and having to have one set of instructions for all workers.  The multiprocessing aspect is great.  I have written quite a few deadlocks so far, not on purpose, but it's a really nice way to visually see deadlocks when multiple people are keeping each other from moving ( yes I know that two people trying to move towards each other will swap.)The language is much improved, and thank you for not making me program in ""machine language"" this time.  Nested if/else statements, compound if statements...this is not far removed from PASCAL or C, or whatever 3rd Gen language you want to compare it to.I was pleased to see the game gave some early programs that were not trivial to write.  Mostly HRM programs were simple for experienced programmers, with the challenge being in optimizing ( some of the last ones took a fair amount of time, like sorting.)  Dangerous Spreadsheets took me a bit of time to figure out ANY solution for example.  But I think people of reasonable intelligence with motivation to solve problems will figure out the puzzles I have solved so far.Money well spent!This game is more challenging than HRM.   Oh, one nitpick.  I didn't see any audio mixer settings, and the music is way too loud.  Maybe they will patch the game if enough people complain about the music hurting their poor ears ( mainly I am talking about the very loud start up music.)  You might want to adjust the game's mixer level in windows."
485,2538,If I was to say this is the best thing since sliced bread I would be lying. There is one thing better than this game... This game AND sliced bread! Amazing game if you enjoy problem solving. This game will leave you sitting there for a long period of time trying to figure out how to do a simple task in the most entertaining of ways.
486,2538,"I found a bug, where workers can walk over holes anyway, it is a really good game, it's a must buy if  you like coding and/or puzzle games"
487,2538,"A parallel-programming version of Human Resource Machine.As a programmer myself, these are the kind of games that give you that joy of finding the solution, the understanding of each individual element, the ability to optimise your code, and something I would have *adored* when I was learning programming some decades ago.Between this, Human Resource Machine, TIS-100 and SpaceChem, you can truly see whether you have the aptitude and attitude to enjoy programming."
488,2538,"Human Resource Machine for parallel algorithms. I love it so far. The interface and the gameplay are not very different from the first one, but the puzzles require different thinking.Graphics are cute and music has not been annoying yet (but I fear that it might get annoying the longer I play). The story is completely unnecessary but quite funny.From gameplay perspective, I sometimes struggle a little to drag the commands to the right if / else branch that I intend, but nothing serious. It would be helpful to have a copy/paste of just a piece of code, rather than overwriting the whole thing from the clipboard. And it would also be nice to know the target program length and speed challenges beforehand, not only when the level has been solved. However, those are not big problems."
489,2538,"22i wanna report a crash bug, the game will crash after go through 22th level,i wonder if the problem was just  happened on me...."
490,2538,Tomorrow Corporation is my favorite company.
491,2538,love it.

493,2538,"For those just interested in gameplay: https://youtu.be/IVgtriukg2k7 Billion Humans is a great way to introduce family and kids, especially younger ones, to the world of CODING! It does a great job at making the activity easy to understand and fun at the same time. On top of the adorable artistic design, it is shaping up to me one of my favorite coding games currently available.A surprisingly fun game."
494,2538,"Puzzles in this sequel are so good. Highly recommended for programmer or even beginner who wants to explore the concept of programming. Great visual and sounds, the story is a bit ridiculous (but after knowing HRM who came here for storyline anyway). Totally worth it. Awesome game"
495,2538,"Engaging logic puzzles for those who like (learning to) program. Not ""develop"" as it's known nowadays, but actually program. It's not as down-to-the-core as Human Resource Machine (which they tell me is assembly-ish) but it's more basic-ish. And this time around, your script has to work for multiple workers at the same time and requires much more planning. And speed is not measured in steps but in seconds, and operations cost time. It's hard to explain, really, but come on, it's a programming/logic/puzzle game with a definite 10/10 for charm. And the music absolutely rocks! Can't wait for a proper soundtrack - this is instant car driving music for me.It's fun trying to come up with the intended good solution for normal people, which is often hard enough as it is if you want to meet the OCD requirements. Then there's the ""best known"" solution, which is OCD on steroids. Apparently, russian hackers, 64k-demo-designers and speedrunners have been testing this pearl and coming up with crazy hacks to finish levels even smaller or even faster, and their results have been added so you can play against their ghosts as well.I'm I don't know how many hours in and I'm only to level 12, but I'm the kind of completionist who really wants to 100% a level before moving on. If you're like me, make sure to free up some serious time.What's not so cool:- The commands can be a bit fiddly. Especially with complicated if statements, you may want to juggle around some details (the order of operations is not math-standard), and though the GUI tries to make it as insightful as possible, there's a lot of clicking and dragging involved. After a level or 7, I started writing copypasting my scripts between the game and a Notepad++ window so I could edit there. Although it's somewhat fun to have that 4th-wall-breaking detail and it's cool to be able to use your favourite editor for an actual in-game goal, a less clicky way to work with the language would be much appreciated. I get that it's readied for mobile/touch use, but I can't imagine how fiddly that would be with an if statement with complicated terms.- The constant bobbing and weaving of the background. Luckily there's now a config setting to turn it off. But why there's no simple in-game menu for these things, I'll never understand.Being somewhat fiddly to work with is a bad thing for a game, even when it's programming, and it's easy to lose focus. Then again, the music stays on in the background and it taskswitches seamlessy, so why not check your mail every once in a while to clear your mind :)Anyway, awesome game again. Like always."
496,2538,"If you have very basic knowledge of programming, then this game is really neat and you'll probably like it. Really neat game!!"
497,2538,"Pretty awesome so far. It took me a little bit to really get into the game (which was the same for the previous to be honest) but after doing a few puzzles it quickly builds up to what Human Resource Machine did so well. It even adds a couple features like memory (which the only game only sort of had with squares), now each worker can memorize up to 4 objects on the screen,  which allows you to do easy and quick memory management.If you liked the previous game, this game should be just as good if not better"
498,2538,"If you liked Human Resource Machine: this one is even better! If you haven't played HRM before, you may want to do that before going for this one (and it's free if you're quick) It's not required and you can surely play it without knowing about HRM, but I guess going back to HRM after this will feel a bit strange... 7B/7B from me!"
499,2538,"Even better than the first one, just great!PS: On the technical side, there could be some improvements: Ultrawide-support, gamma-setting, independent volume for effects and music, maybe some graphics improvements."
500,2538,Good game very fun. I like this game developer.
501,2538,"7 Billion Humans is a worthy successor of Human Resource Machine, It is longer, more variety, the humor is a bit more refined. If you loved Human Resource Machine, 7 Billion Humans is precisely what you want."
502,2538,"first few levels""Go ahead and have your workers move A to B""last few levels""Just  write a 100 line long code that sorts 100 data cubes from prime numbers to odd to even numbers and if a male worker picks up a data cube thats a multiple of 2 then they explode""10/10"
503,2538,Feels like work but fun.
504,2538,"Finished the game in 21 hours(8/27/2018),  spent my long weekend playing this game!!High Reco!!"
505,2538,"A well-made, unique, and very compelling game.  Easy at the beginning, difficult at the end.The main story is not super long, but there are plenty of optional challenges along the way to keep a fan playing for a long time.I got a little frustrated toward the end when I was hampered by limitations and idiosyncracies in the tools I was given, but this was made up for by the joy of watching my minions finally solve each puzzle.  I enjoyed the experience and I'm very glad I played it!"
506,2538,A+
507,2538,Basically Human Resource Machine 2.
508,2538,so smart!
509,2538,Works great on Linux!
510,2538,"Such fun, so hard..."
511,2538,Great game if you like to do some programming as a hobby... especially after a work's day of...programming.I don't know why I do this to myself...
512,2538,It's amazing. It's everything HRM was but better.
513,2538,"This is a sequel to Human Resource Machine - if you liked that game, you'll love this one even more. From the get go, the expanded commands and multithreadedness will both fascinate and frustrate you. Don't give up, as the game just offers more and more with each new chapter."
514,2538,"This game is like popcorn shrimp, I just keep playing and playing and  the puzzles are fun.If you have no computer science background you might find the learning curve a little difficult but once you get it you get it."
515,2538,Awesome game
516,2538,"My expectations were very high going into this game. They were surpassed. 7 Billion Humans uses Human Resource Machine as a point of departure, but quickly becomes wildly different. Wow! My brain is on fire. 10/10."
517,2538,"Have you ever wanted to write multithreaded programs full of data races in BASIC-y language whose only control structures are simple if-else and jumps? Me neither.But you should try it, cause the game is great.The programming language for your office workers gets introduced slowly, so even without any prior programming experience one should manage to follow it, the main tasks-puzzles are doable, and optimizing challenges get hard (and still often it is possible to go much below what the challenge asks for). Also, the game runs flawlessly on Linux."
518,2538,played for some h now and I think its better than the first game!
519,2538,"Not as fun as it's predecessor. Doesn't clearly indicate the order in which commands are processed or how performing an operation on a cell changes its state, leaving you to work out precedence and output through trial and error, which isn't much fun in a logic game. Hope future updates clarify the function of commands."
520,2538,Amazing game and teaches you basics of logic gating
521,2538,a fun and challenging game. cant reccomended it enough :)
522,2538,"Hilarious, witty and challenging. Boy is it a good feeling when all your little humans do exactly what you wanted them to. Difficulty scales up nicely as you go along and the levels constantly throw something new at you!"
523,2538,"If you have ever played Human Resource Machine, which is made by the same guys who made this game, the premise is the same; You have a task to do, and you can accomplish it using a variety of commands. The ""catch"" with 7 billion humans is that now you control multiple humans! The UI and generally the gameplay of 7 billion humans is similar to that of HRM, with the difference the language you use to control the humans no longer resembles an Assembly-like language, but it is closer to more modern languages, like C++ or Java (but of course much simpler that the afore-mentioned).In terms of complexity, the challenges of this game are noticably more difficult than those of the previous game. The optimization challenges are especially very difficult and require you to think ""out of the box"". The humour of the game I found to be funny and I loved the constant references to automation and robots, considering this is the main ""theme"" of the game.In general, this game took everything that made HRM great and made them even better!The only thing I found somewhat annoying is the fact you are unable to copy specific commands directly from a programme you made in the game and paste them on a programme without deleting all the other commands."
524,2538,Another beautiful game from Tomorrow Corporation. A must buy for everyone who likes a puzzle challenge and solid game design in a weird world that might not be so far away.
525,2538,"Guys, don`t you know that GOTO considered harmful? This ""jump"" command really annoys me, otherwise great game! I also didn`t figure out where to look what optional objectives are.,    ,   GOTO  ?  """"   ,    !"
526,2538,"I've just finished this game (admittedly skipping a puzzle or two), and I have to say, I'm disappointed.TL;DR: Try Human Resource Machine first. If that game isn't perfect in your eyes, don't even THINK about getting this game. Otherwise, give it a try!I've played quite a few puzzle games thus far - a lot of Zachtronics games, and some other lower-level games like Silicon Zeroes and Prime Mover. Human Resource Machine was one of  the first ones of these that I saw. It looked pretty neat, so I decided to pick it up. Despite having a clunky interface that's clearly made so it's easily portable to tablets, it was an alright game! So naturally, I was on the lookout for the sequel (this game!), and picked it up on launch day. However...It's a  totally different experience. Outside of the tutorial puzzles (about 20 of the 64ish levels), you're usually given a huge pile of data, and an amount of workers, and have to do something with that data. For example, one of the levels involves taking a line of datacubes, and putting them all into a shredder. This is a pretty straightforward puzzle - just think about how you'd do this with one person and one line of data:Note the location of the nearest shredderMove upwards until you find some dataPick it upPut it into the shredderRepeat ad infinitumPretty straightforwards, and those are usually nice puzzles to solve, since you can think of them as doing a simple task to some data like you do in HRM. I loved those puzzles! Some other puzzles include doing something on a set of data that's made easier with parallelization (the first sorting puzzle comes to mind)... however, there are other puzzles where parallelization just makes things worse, much worse.The main issue I have is that you have zero control over your workers. One of the puzzles requires you to write the numbers 0 - 99 on datacubes, in any order. You're given a 10x10 grid of them, as well as 10 workers. Pretty simple algorithm... or it would be, if all the workers started off in a line. They don't though, they're in a jagged line, which makes syncing them up an absolute nightmare. It's still doable, but just so... irritating.Another issue is that there's zero way to communicate between workers until you get to the last dozen or so puzzles, which is limited to ""wait until I hear this word"" and ""tell everyone/the person in this direction this word"". So you can't transmit data between workers, and you REALLY have to sync things up, because it works completely different to other ""transmission"" implementations.There's also no real ""fast forward"" button. There's up to x12 speed, but x1 speed is PAINFULLY slow. The solutions are measured in seconds (which is insanely ambiguous to the extent where I'm not going to bother optimizing puzzles), some of them take ~5 minutes to run at real time, which is still about 30 seconds sped up to full speed. It's just agonizing!You're also only SOMETIMES told if you do something wrong. One puzzle has you doubling a number digit by digit, and writing that sequence to a screen (1, 2, 4, 8, 1 6, 3 2.... and so on). You're not told if this goes wrong. At all. Given that this puzzle takes AGES to run through, you might be tempted to put it on full speed and grab a snack. Nope. If your solution goes wrong, you'll not know about it at all!The hint system is... awful. Only some puzzles have hints, and of those that do, the hint is usually just straight up telling you the solution, which completely ruins the fun!Thankfully, you're allowed to skip puzzles; you can have up to 5 puzzles skipped at any one time, which was nice, at least. Besides that though, this game doesn't have a lot going for it. I praised the dance cutscene in my previous joke review, and I do like the cutscenes (they're surreal in Tomorrow Corp's signature manner), but that's about all the credit I can give this game. Finish HRM first, then get this game if you loved that!"
527,2538,"Plays just like the Human Resource Machine, only far more detailed/complex puzzles and programming options.Great educational game."

Despite having a clunky interface that's clearly made so it's easily portable to tablets, it was an alright game! So naturally, I was on the lookout for the sequel (this game!), and picked it up on launch day. However...It's a  totally different experience. Outside of the tutorial puzzles (about 20 of the 64ish levels), you're usually given a huge pile of data, and an amount of workers, and have to do something with that data. For example, one of the levels involves taking a line of datacubes, and putting them all into a shredder. This is a pretty straightforward puzzle - just think about how you'd do this with one person and one line of data:Note the location of the nearest shredderMove upwards until you find some dataPick it upPut it into the shredderRepeat ad infinitumPretty straightforwards, and those are usually nice puzzles to solve, since you can think of them as doing a simple task to some data like you do in HRM. I loved those puzzles! Some other puzzles include doing something on a set of data that's made easier with parallelization (the first sorting puzzle comes to mind)... however, there are other puzzles where parallelization just makes things worse, much worse.The main issue I have is that you have zero control over your workers. One of the puzzles requires you to write the numbers 0 - 99 on datacubes, in any order. You're given a 10x10 grid of them, as well as 10 workers. Pretty simple algorithm... or it would be, if all the workers started off in a line. They don't though, they're in a jagged line, which makes syncing them up an absolute nightmare. It's still doable, but just so... irritating.Another issue is that there's zero way to communicate between workers until you get to the last dozen or so puzzles, which is limited to ""wait until I hear this word"" and ""tell everyone/the person in this direction this word"". So you can't transmit data between workers, and you REALLY have to sync things up, because it works completely different to other ""transmission"" implementations.There's also no real ""fast forward"" button. There's up to x12 speed, but x1 speed is PAINFULLY slow. The solutions are measured in seconds (which is insanely ambiguous to the extent where I'm not going to bother optimizing puzzles), some of them take ~5 minutes to run at real time, which is still about 30 seconds sped up to full speed. It's just agonizing!You're also only SOMETIMES told if you do something wrong. One puzzle has you doubling a number digit by digit, and writing that sequence to a screen (1, 2, 4, 8, 1 6, 3 2.... and so on). You're not told if this goes wrong. At all. Given that this puzzle takes AGES to run through, you might be tempted to put it on full speed and grab a snack. Nope. If your solution goes wrong, you'll not know about it at all!The hint system is... awful. Only some puzzles have hints, and of those that do, the hint is usually just straight up telling you the solution, which completely ruins the fun!Thankfully, you're allowed to skip puzzles; you can have up to 5 puzzles skipped at any one time, which was nice, at least. Besides that though, this game doesn't have a lot going for it. I praised the dance cutscene in my previous joke review, and I do like the cutscenes (they're surreal in Tomorrow Corp's signature manner), but that's about all the credit I can give this game. Finish HRM first, then get this game if you loved that!"
530,2538,"Plays just like the Human Resource Machine, only far more detailed/complex puzzles and programming options.Great educational game."
531,2538,"Very well presented puzzle game that teaches programming fundementals and efficiency. I am enjoying it and assume this would be a great learning tool for kids, or all ages really."
532,2538,"This is a programmer ass programmer game. Love it. I'm only on the 11th elevator, must buy for programmers though. You'll have a ball with this puzzle game."
533,2538,"Edit: Great quick fix! I like programming assembly, and I like parallelization. I beat HRM and enjoyed it. However, in this game the constant swaying in both the elevator and on the puzzle levels makes me so motion sick I can't continue playing."
534,2538,"I'll preface this by saying this has been on my wishlist for months! Honestly, a truly great puzzle game. Certainly up there with Human Resource Machine with Tomorrow's trademark humour. Follows a very similar format albeit with a few new twists, and many more puzzles than its predecessor. Thoroughly recommend!"
535,2538,A worthy sequel to Human Resource Machine
536,2538,"As Puzzles go, it's a bunch of fun.However, can't recommend on the grounds that there's NO  VOLUME SLIDER! (That I can find...)"
537,2538,"If you know Human Resource Machine, you've got a good idea what you get here (if not, do get HRM now!). In 7 Billion Humans, we're not programming a single worker, but a whole bunch working in parallel. The options at hand are more complex and even more programming language like. It seems to me the optimization tasks, which I had a love-hate relationship with in HRM, are even harder here.It is a great game! Huge! Believe me!PS: As usual with Tomorrow Corporation, the game runs flawlessly (and natively) on Linux."
538,2538,"Excellent game, fun to keep optimising! Even better than Human Resource Machine, which was also excellent. Love the music (soundtrack is free with the game), gameplay and graphics. It's rare to see a game this polished on release.The puzzles are addictive, and cover a lot of the different thinking parallel computing needs - shared resources, cooperation etc.The game is very open to novices, explaining each new thing as it comes along. But there is a lot of depth in the tweaking you can do to optimise the best you can for program length or speed.If you haven't played the first game, make sure you do that too."
539,2538,"A deserving sequel. Absolutely fantastic. Stunning art, music, and puzzle design.I recommend playing Human Resource Machine before playing this game, but if you enjoyed HRM (which, how could you not?) then I am positive you will love this game."
540,2538,"Nice level design. I can imagine it would be very friendly to people with no prior programming knowlege. Not sure if it's because I barely had any assemly language experiences before, I did find a lot of HRM levels a little challanging. Had to stop and think for a while before coming up with a solution. And the usual case is, as long as i could come up with a solution in HRM, I could easily pass through the optimisation&efficiency challanges without thinking. Things are a little different with 7BH. The levels (at least the early levels) are easier to pass. 7BH uses Object-oriented language, which is much more instinctive to use for human brains. I've only played the game for 10 minutes or so and now up to the 14th year. I could baiscally drag out a solution instantly after reading the instructions. But optimisation and efficiency seems to be an issue. At least i could not finish those two challanges with one go as I previously did in HRM.Overall I think it's much easier than HRM so far. I might change my opinion as I further progress through the game tho."
541,2538,"I have been a big fan of this company since it's first game, World of Goo. All of their games, from Human Resource Machine to Little Inferno are all wonderful. They have a polish to them that is rarely seen these days. 7 Billion Humans is no ecxeption.The game is challenging, rewarding, and most importantly, a joy to play."
542,2538,Great puzzle game
543,2538,"Really great game if you're into the genre. Very polished and the cut scenes are hilarious. I liked Human Resource Machine, but I think this one is even better. The puzzles are much more interesting with a horde of workers running around!"
