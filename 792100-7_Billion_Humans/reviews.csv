In most puzzle games, there's one predetermined solution, and the tasks are made in a way that would make it impossible to come up with any other approach. This game is not like that - it gives you a set of tools, and you solve the problem as you see fit, no pressure in how you do that - and this is close to an ideal puzzle game for me. And you're not getting lost in this freedom, it is apparent which tools you need to use to reach the goal. You might need to implement a certain solution if you're trying to complete optional tasks, but this is up to you, there's no unlocks besides achievements for doing so.Pretty much all the gripes I had with HRM are fixed in this game - it is longer (it took me around 10 hours to finish the game without optional challenges), it uses more high-level commands so programming does not feel like a chore, the tasks are purposeful and visually comprehensible.I have a few nitpicks though:1) Some mechanics are underutilized, like buttons, sensors and displays in the last few levels. Also, some tasks do not let you use certain commands, which is a shame. Kinda asks for level editor, eh?2) When optimizing a program for execution speed, I wish there was a profiler of sorts to see how long each line takes, or at least a clear way to see a command execution time, without manually checking it with a timer.3) I wish there was an explanation for certain nuances of commands. For example, I was avoiding combining ANDs and ORs in conditionals because it is not explained how they are grouped.  The directional checks are also quite nondeterministic in how they happen in a dynamic environments, like when a box you just checked gets picked up before you can do anything about it, and I get it that multithreading is naturally undeterministic, but sometimes I had to manually tweak the solution around that, hoping that it'll stickTL;DR A nice puzzle game about programming, don't look at big words I randomly threw about, it is really not that hard, try it out"

I've written assembly programs before. I didn't realize at first why I was writing duplicate code so much more often than I do when actually programming. But I've figured it out about 4/5ths into the game. There's no jump return. This is an absolute killer when it comes to what programmers like doing - cutting problems into parts and isolating each part in it's own method. In this game, if you section off code for a specific purpose, there's no way to return to where you called the method. So you can't call a method from multiple places outside specific circumstances. Which means you're forced to write duplicate code over and over, which is both tedious and feels wrong because normally that's a warning sign that you're writing bad code. This is all frustrating because actually solving the puzzles is fun, and turtle programming, assembly, and multithreading is a combination you'll probably never encounter outside this game, which means these are all puzzles you've never seen before, but that missing jump return means actually implementing your solution is a chore nearly every single time.Plot wise, I didn't finish it, but this is obviously weaker than, for example, world of goo in that aspect, for one major reason. In world of goo, you are very involved in the story during gameplay. Lots of the levels feature plot taking place as you solve the level (most of the chapter finales, for example). In 7 billion humans, the story of the game and the levels are completely isolated."

At least the first half of a game is still nice.Oh wow, I actually did it. I beat this nice big brain boi. I now have the big brain. Fear my brain and call it Brian, for otherwise it will rip my head off.This was quite a change from the prequel. Where in prequel, Human Resource Machine, it was rather down-to-Earth assembly, with many puzzles being something that were rather been-there-done-that for my student experience, this one shot straight for parallel (a word which I hate for I can't remember which consonant is double) programming, something that I have zero experience. And boy, I fear parallel programming now. John Carmack said nothing wrong... if I remember right. Something about being disappointed in multicore?...Wait, no, he never claimed that he hated multicore, just checked. F for my anecdote.Well, it's not just parallel programming that is new. The language is now a small-time high-low level programming mess. But it works. But now it's less fitting to PC archtecture, for now workers can move over any space in the room and you have to account for time it takes for the workers to perform an action, otherwise everything may desynchronize, so much for your parallel programming skills. Okay, you probably have to do the latter in real programming too but it's never about ""worker"" moving across whole ""room"", get it?Still, half of time puzzles and solution are beautiful and another half of time they are ugly to look at and I just want to forget they existh. In a sense of hackyness, I mean. But puzzles actually made me stumble and think a lot, so that was great. I also would often look into guides to see other people solutions for optional challenges and learn a bit from them. There are still space and performance optional challenges, yas. This time around, it's performance challenges that often lead to nice beautiful code. Performance now takes into account the time itself instead of commands. Randomized values may bite you there. Size of code requirement is bloody ugly 99%, each worker often having to perform same codes that often have obsolote operation for them. For example, you will have to deal with witnessing one of the workers complaining that he has nothing to pick up all because others do have to pick up a datacube.Rules weren't always clear enough however. Whether worker moving into another worker's will swap places with him or get blocked never seemed clear enough. Also, there is now ""if"" command that can multiple ""or"" and ""and"" operators. I don't think that game has implemented logic operators priorities either. And in code size challenge, they all count as a single piece of code, with ""else"" being seen as another line that impacts the size challenge.Overall? Worth it!Something big is coming... Could it be?.. Biggg Data!Bwaha!Give me more of that music like Lady Sky track! Free soundtrack included, great!Oh, and plot wasn't painfully boring this time. There is barely a spoon of it but it was cute and funny."

For me, ""developing"" the algorithms for solving these levels is a lot of fun, and it remembers me of the fun part of programming. Getting to a solution is easy enough, but thinking of ways to optimise the solutions with the constraints of the provided ""programming language"" provides you a nice challenge.But if you have never done any coding before, playing this game will teach you lots of usefull skills. First and foremost you'll improve your problem solving skills. Besides this you get to know some of the stuff/constructs programmers have to deal with (code branching, loops, multithreading problems). Good stuff!I personally have just one negative thing to note about this game: the interface is pretty much developed in a mobile first manner (for example, you are able to add comments to your ""code"", but you would have to draw the letters with your mouse... really, really awkward).Thats said...

If you liked the first game, you’ll like this one.  It does require you to think differently when trying to solve the tasks in a parallel way, but I enjoyed it all the way through.Con’sInterface is still the same, which means as the code gets longer, using a mouse to drag and drop commands can be a little tedious and tricky, especially long jump commands.  Similarly, tracing code within the small view can be tricky.  I would have like the ability to zoom out to view more lines of code on the screen at once.OverallI would recommend this game to anyone new to coding (and wants to learn parallel processing concepts) or to someone who just wants to play a casual coding game.

For instance most of the fastest solutions have far MORE instructions than the slower ones... This is because its counting time for the animations against you... So if you are adding to a counter or something, that few seconds while your cute little dude visualizes that math is time you're being penalized for... Mean while if you 'hardcode' it, with inflexible garbage, it will actually run much faster and get you the speed awards.This rather sends the wrong message to new coders I think, tidy code is fast code.  Teach that.It would be nice if it had some concept of subroutines, maybe it does at higher levels, I'm at about 49 so far and it's slow to deliver new commands.   It encourages use of the 'Jump' command as a work around for all kinds of things.. Jump is pretty much a 'Goto' and really, I spend enough time cleaning up that kind of code in the real world.  It ain't funny man.  Anyhow, other than the fact that it teaches you to be a pretty gawd awful coder, it does deliver on some of the basics that a person might want to get their head around if they are heading down that road (don't do it!  For the love of God, just become a fence painter or something, it's not worth the pain)."

You use drag-and-drop code to control multiple workers (unlike HRM where you only controlled one person), to pick up items, drop them, and occasionally plunge them off cliffs or order them to jump into shredders. All of the levels have optional goals of using the fewest number of steps or the least lines of code for added challenge. Because you have to control multiple works using the same code, yet sometimes have the workers do different tasks, it requires a lot of lateral thinking to get them to work independently, which is an added challenge. The artwork is cartoonish, and it has a doofy premise where robots have taken over the planet and put all humans out of a job...so humans get put to work doing the monotonous, routine tasks for the robots.Overall, if you enjoy coding for ridiculously dumb reasons, this game is for you.

You can also skip up to 5 levels at a time.3) If you want an extra challenge, you can try to tie or beat the current world record - the players on the forum keep track of those.4) The game achieves a very good balance between explaining the mechanics and letting the players explore the details on their own.5) You won't encounter any bugs in the first ~150 hours, and ones that are present are pretty minor and easily avoidable.Negatives:1) Lack of proper sound controls.2) Some parts of the game run slower than they need to, for example the automated tests don't take full advantage of your PC's computational resources.3) Lost opportunity: A level editor + Steam Workshop could easily quadruple the fun, but the developers decided to not do it.In conclusion, the positives outweigh the negatives by an order of magnitude.

It does a good job teaching programming basics using a GUI block-style system. It also has pretty interesting and cynical commentary on corporations, which I love. I heartily recommend this game.However as a programmer of many years I have 1 major issue with this game. Like every programming game I've played so far, It uses a style of programming which becomes very tedious as the challenges get more complicated. It becomes nearly impossible to logically reason your way through the challenges... you must resort to trial and error. Early in my career I tried to get away from doing programming because most learning materials modeled programming this way. It is a horrendously boring way to solve problems. 7 Billion Humans triggered that same feeling in me and I stopped playing it at that point. I did complete HR Machine to finish the story but for the last handful of levels I looked up solutions. Because it just wasn't fun.My suggestion to the game devs is this: introduce functions in later levels of the game. This one feature would bring the game back from mostly trial and error in latter levels to something more fun and manageable. And like in real programming it provides a sense of progression. You could save solutions from previous challenges as functions to easily reuse them in later levels. You'd additionally have all my respect if you went to functional instead of imperative programming. But you would have to come up with much more complicated puzzles because the game as is would be far too easy.Great game, cheap, must buy. If you are interested in programming, don't let the advanced levels of the game turn you off to it."

This game goes a little further compared to human resource marchine: instead of just doing basic programming, you will do things that computers execute every day! Defragmenting, for instance. This may seem daunting at first... but the game's aesthetics are clear and not unpleasant to the eyes, which helps to cut down on confusion. The levels also start easy and then ramp up on difficulty until they are very tough. Although if you can't seem to get the optimisation rewards on some levels, you can use one of the guides on the internet with a convenient copy and paste feature. If you're just here for the achievements, this makes the game trivial. Personally, I did not like the story or character design that much (but that is objective and you may like it more. It is in a similar vein to the one in human resource machine, but not the same.) The puzzles are great though. Recommended if you're interested in programming, even if you have no knowledge of it!

They are now both 4 years old.When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiralling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.Thank you."

That can lead to a lot of frustration where something that feels like a valid solution falls apart because of timing: How were you supposed to know that a ""Calc"" instruction takes more time than a ""Pick Up"" instruction? Contrast it to EXAPUNKS, where every instruction takes 1 cycle and you can burn excess cycles using the NOOP instruction. EXAPUNKS is challenging, but you always feel rewarded when you think a puzzle through. By contrast, 7 Billion Humans sometimes makes you guess what kind of solution the developers had in mind.Still, on the whole, this is a fun programming game and a worthy sequel to Human Resource Machine.

And more variety!This game features a new programming language which is more ""high level"" instead of being directly analogous to machine code like in the first game. Simple tasks using nearby tiles are easier, but navigating to a specific tile is much harder. More importantly, the multithreading turns everything on its head. You have to account for several people executing the same code at once, and/or have a worker detect at the start that they should be shunted off to a different loop.There's a lot more variety in the available commands and the tasks you're asked to solve. Maybe a third of the levels are math-based as opposed to nearly all in the first game, and there's always a position component. I found the puzzles in this game MUCH harder than the first game, especially the later levels.The plot's a bit of a downgrade, but dialog is still pretty funny. And you can click on every worker to learn a little something about them, which is neat.Overall, a very worthy sequel to the first game.

If not you may want to try that first, instead. Getting the hang of programming your little agent before getting into coordinating multiple agents, synchronization issues, etc. is probably a good idea. If you jump straight into the game the problems will probably still be solvable just fine, but your learning curve will be somewhat steeper.The concept is the same as in HRM and randomness now which allows for fancy ""almost certainly solves the problem"" solutions - especially fun when optimizing for size. Unfortunately the time limit is somewhat low - I would've wished for a higher speedup-factor when playing it and some higher bar on the runtime in exchange. Also the ""parallelism"" is weirdish: all agents run in lockstep which makes up for some very awkward solutions in OCD land that simply shouldn't work.Solutions only have to work 50% of the time allowing for speed optimization by not working in cases that'd be slow - something that turned out to be really fun when squeezing out some extra seconds. Unfortunately getting those deliberately non-robust solutions accepted by the game is somewhat tedious. First you have to be somewhat lucky in the run you're making. Second after getting a run through it forces the RNG to a seed that failed until you pass again which forces you to run some other solution in between.Finally at some points it would've been nice to set breakpoints while debugging - maybe in the next game.Gameplay aside the visuals and sounds are absolutely lovely. And the cutscenes with their little story even more so.As usual with Tomorrow Corporation: I didn't run into any bugs whatsoever! (I played all their games.)All things considered I had a blast while playing and don't regret getting this at full price at all - 9.5/10Note: I'm a professional programmer with over a decade of experience. If you have little to no programming experience you should probably not try to OCD the game as some of those challanges are *really* hard. Even so you may have quite some fun solving the puzles."

Due to the more limited commands I would even argue that this is harder than EXAPUNKS or TIS-100Only complaint is that randomization isn't communicated very well - e.g. some boxes are obviously random, some boxes are obviously static, and other boxes change between different tests and you have no way of knowing that until you produce a solution that depends on the values and fails on some of the test runs. Similarly, you are never really told if maze-like levels always have the same layout so you have to work it out by trial and error. A way to step through the possible test cases (e.g. like you can in EXAPUNKS) would be much appreciated."

792100,2,0,mrdingodile,3,2,1,13.9,"September 8, 2018","It has some good ideas.I enjoy games like this, but would point out a couple of things that might throw people off.There are no settings to speak of: No resolution options, no volume sliders, only thing you can toggle is full screen and music. Even if you toggle off the music you will hear a humming brown noise sort of thing at any volume.The forced long drawn speech bubbles are more a nuisance than anything, and the cutscenes are an autoskip for me every time.I can live with these thing, but there are some frustrating things in terms of the gameplay and teaching thereof. Some things are just not explained or counter intuitive if you know programming even. Like their IF modules, you can have AND and OR combinations, but how that works make no sense really, it's not order specific and there are no explanation for how it determines what makes sense. Nor are there parentheses. So if you are trying to make something simple and short happen, you might like me end up fighting the approach used more than trying to solve the puzzle.You can of course attempt to do it in other ways in which case your solution becomes a mess.It's fine having challenges, but the game promotes fairly simple solutions to fairly complex puzzles with no guidance, I would almost say it doesn't feel quite polished.I hope some updates come in the future to give people proper options, and that allow a better help system, because as a programmer I find it like having to write AI in BASIC but only have 15 lines of code available to me at times.I would recommend it, though I find the 12½ EUR maybe a little much when games much more complex are less than this, but it's cheap anyway so I guess that's alright."

792100,9,0,Kinglink,321,651,1,6.8,"September 7, 2018","Full Review --   Curator Site Video Review: https://youtu.be/_3g2wxqNR-k7 Billion Humans is the latest from Tomorrow Corporation, who have developed Human Resource Machine and World of Goo previous to this. Both of those games are unique and interesting concepts, so does 7 Billion Humans live up to that legacy? Let’s take a look.7 Billion Humans starts by informing the player that robots have taken all their jobs, and it’s the age of the singularity, and we have benevolent robot overlords who make everyone’s lives easier and let them do what they want. But humans want “jobs” and as such the robots, including a really obvious but humorous political caricature, gives all the human jobs.So all 7 billion humans are told to show up for their jobs at a monolithic office building. This is just a simplistic storyline for why humans are following orders from the player and their robot overlords but it works and is a bit humorous. In fact, the game does have a good sense of humor, and there are a number of scenes that made me laugh.The core of the game, however, is instructing humans how to solve simplistic tasks such as lining up data cubes, writing new data cubes, using printers and shredders and more. The player is limited in how they can instruct the humans, and the game slowly gives the player more and more instructions with which to write their scripts.So yes, this is a programming game, and a sequel to Human Resource Machine, but unlike Zachtronics games and others where you are writing programs, 7 Billion Humans tackles programming in a different way. The interface is similar to Scratch programming, a drag and drop language where programmers don’t have to really understand the program themselves, they instead just order the instructions and the correct code is generated behind the scenes. Here, it’s the same, if you want your humans to step to the right, pick up an object, and then drop it, you drag and drop each instruction into your program in order and the humans will follow those orders until they reach the end of the program or an “end” instruction.The drag and drop interface makes the game a bit more user-friendly, but personally, I always feel like the enjoyment I have in them becomes tedium before the end, as there are so many steps I’m required to drag and drop into place. Sadly, 7 Billion Humans isn’t an exception here. Once I reach 20-30 commands in a program it creates that tedium, but even when it’s early in the game and I have to do four different conditional statements, I feel like I want to have the ability to copy and paste a single block of code, rather than the entire code block.The tasks the game require you to solve are interesting at first. There are simple tasks such as picking up a block and moving it down two spaces, or lining up all the datacubes (which are representations of information). However as the game goes on, I found myself returning to old levels often to copy a solution and then return to the current level to paste that solution in. It wouldn’t solve the levels, but many of the solutions were 95 percent complete in a previous level, and only a small change is being asked for. When it happened in EXAPUNKS, I found myself to enjoy the experience because I was using a small amount of my code (Around 30 percent) that had already been optimized, and there’s a new addition to the problem that requires almost double the code to solve the additional problem. In 7 Billion Humans, I found I’m mostly reusing the majority of code because I’m being asked to do something similar with a small twist.The good news though is 7 Billion Humans pushes multithreading, hard. Where Human Resource Machine was a similar game to 7 Billion Humans, Human Resource Machine focused on a single human. Every level of 7 Billion Humans contains more than one human. In the early part of the game, they can each run their own script and ignore the other workers. Once the game gets going though they’ll eventually have to look for other workers, run synchronized programs, and eventually communicate with each other.The unfortunate fact though is the multithreading is limited to that. There are the ability to observe other workers, and passing objects between them, and even simple wait for communication instructions, but there’s nothing beyond that. The ability to communicate without halting execution until communication occurs doesn’t exist here and it limits the problem space that can be handled by the game.That doesn’t mean there are not good puzzles here, it’s just that there’s a limit to the complexity of them to the point that many of the final problems have very short code, and rather simplistic multithreading. There’s also the problem of randomized code here, where a few floors require a solution that relies on randomized instructions, and honestly, I found those puzzles to be more frustrating than worthwhile.It’s not that I hate 7 Billion Humans or the puzzles involved in it. It’s just that it doesn’t reach a depth of code where I can say I felt that rewarded with my solutions, especially near the end of the game. I don’t want to spoil some of the final tasks, and a couple of the final puzzles are very clever. However the final puzzles felt a touch too easy for my taste, and I could have gone with something a little more challenging at that point in the game.Having finished the majority of the 68 levels in under 7 hours, I wonder if it was a situation where my skills as a programmer tipped the scales in my favor, and I believe that could be part of the problem, however I feel that games like 7 Billion Humans is already aimed at those of us who enjoy programming. So it’s a game that wants programmers but only will challenge the beginners in the field. A shame the game is so laser targeted at that group because it’s such an enjoyable game as you play it.I then turned to the idea of optimization to play a little more, but ultimately I didn’t find optimizing programs here as rewarding as I expected. The game does have very reasonable lower limits, and in fact the player is able to even go below the “optimized’ goal at times, however most of these programs are rather short, and knowing there’s a 10 instruction lower limit, when your program is only 11 instructions, usually means there’s an obvious extra instruction (often I needed to remove an else statement).At the end of the day, I finish 7 Billion Humans, and I struggle to judge it. It is a programming game, and I admit those are a niche category, but I also look at my enjoyment with it, and I realize that I have just reviewed a second programming game, EXAPUNKS, and I wonder if part of the reason I struggle to really find the same love of 7 Billion Humans, is due to playing a different game right before it. It’s definitely possible.If you want to read more and see a final score, you can see the full review with pictures and video athttps://kinglink-reviews.com/2018/09/06/7-billion-humans-review/.

792100,4,0,equesneci,183,2,1,15.8,"August 31, 2018","Here a quick review:Target group:People who like to code. I personally did not learn coding, so everything is self-tought. Despite that I have coded some things before in different coding languages for fun. If you consider buying this game, either you should have written some lines of code before, be a programmer (if you like the optimization challenges), or buy the predecessor HRM first which had a slower learning curve and was therefore (at least in my opinion) easier.How long is the gameplay:This obviously depends on your skill level. I have finished the game/main story in barely under 15 hours - without skipping levels or looking up solutions. I did optimize some levels for fun in the beginning and have yet to do about 4-5 ""Side-Quest-Levels"". For me this took one week because I only played about 2h every evening - then my brain needed a break. The gameplay time can be immensely increased by optimizing all 60+ levels (If this is something you enjoy - great!)Gameplay:I personally would have liked the game to get a bit more complex in the end. The second-last duplication-level took me 2 days to sleep over the solution to get it. What a great feeling to have it finally solved, but after that...game finished... If there is to be a part 3, I would be thrilled to have to use For-loops in more variety and most of all procedures. Of course one can make it more complex by optimizing but for me the main fun is to ""get it working somehow, only holding together by duct tape"". But this exactly is the great thing about this game: You are allowed to do this - there is nothing stopping you to send 8 workers to rest and let one guy do the job if it is working in a reasonable time span (By the way: There should be an achievement for ""We can't wait all day for your program to finish""). Be creative and do it your way - or be skilled enough to challenge yourself with the optimizations.Story,  Music:As in HRM - The story is pointless and fun, just what I expected - great. The music is just perfect, no need for a volume slider to turn it down.Recommendation:If (you like to code and already played HRM and enjoyed HRM) {Buy it; No-brainer };Else: My recommendation would be to start with HRM and afterwards buy and play this great game!"

For neophytes, some levels may discourage them, not counting the challenges (maximum number of lines and time challenge), but if you take the time to solve a level, it's not insurmountable. We can go through levels and come back later. In the worst cases, the discussion forum is active and there is already a guide with all the solutions.For people who are used to programming: don't worry, some levels require a good understanding of the environment of each level, otherwise you will stay stuck (parallel programming).

You can find some challenge in this game but I feel like the games main flaw is the starting levels can be mind numbingly easy for people who can solve the later levels and the later levels would be too much of a challenge for people who need the early levels.  I can agree with why this progression is necessary to teach the players, but at the same time I feel like there should be a ""I'm experienced"" option to skip the early levels.Also the idea that the foreach command can find a square with nothing in it and then telling the human to step to that square with nothing does nothing is a baffling decision.

It's a joy to watch all of them scramble to fulfill your commands.A word of warning to people who want to pick this up to learn programming; the concepts are similar but the programming language used in this isn't anything used today, so it's not a substitute for actually learning something like Python.

My software doesn't result in people walking into shredders when it fails to work, which is a pretty good feature...in a game ;)I love the added challenge of having to move my workers around the ""map"" and having to have one set of instructions for all workers.  The multiprocessing aspect is great.  I have written quite a few deadlocks so far, not on purpose, but it's a really nice way to visually see deadlocks when multiple people are keeping each other from moving ( yes I know that two people trying to move towards each other will swap.)The language is much improved, and thank you for not making me program in ""machine language"" this time.  Nested if/else statements, compound if statements...this is not far removed from PASCAL or C, or whatever 3rd Gen language you want to compare it to.I was pleased to see the game gave some early programs that were not trivial to write.  Mostly HRM programs were simple for experienced programmers, with the challenge being in optimizing ( some of the last ones took a fair amount of time, like sorting.)  Dangerous Spreadsheets took me a bit of time to figure out ANY solution for example.  But I think people of reasonable intelligence with motivation to solve problems will figure out the puzzles I have solved so far.Money well spent!This game is more challenging than HRM.   Oh, one nitpick.  I didn't see any audio mixer settings, and the music is way too loud.

It's not as down-to-the-core as Human Resource Machine (which they tell me is assembly-ish) but it's more basic-ish. And this time around, your script has to work for multiple workers at the same time and requires much more planning. And speed is not measured in steps but in seconds, and operations cost time. It's hard to explain, really, but come on, it's a programming/logic/puzzle game with a definite 10/10 for charm. And the music absolutely rocks! Can't wait for a proper soundtrack - this is instant car driving music for me.It's fun trying to come up with the intended good solution for normal people, which is often hard enough as it is if you want to meet the OCD requirements. Then there's the ""best known"" solution, which is OCD on steroids. Apparently, russian hackers, 64k-demo-designers and speedrunners have been testing this pearl and coming up with crazy hacks to finish levels even smaller or even faster, and their results have been added so you can play against their ghosts as well.I'm I don't know how many hours in and I'm only to level 12, but I'm the kind of completionist who really wants to 100% a level before moving on. If you're like me, make sure to free up some serious time.What's not so cool:- The commands can be a bit fiddly. Especially with complicated if statements, you may want to juggle around some details (the order of operations is not math-standard), and though the GUI tries to make it as insightful as possible, there's a lot of clicking and dragging involved. After a level or 7, I started writing copypasting my scripts between the game and a Notepad++ window so I could edit there. Although it's somewhat fun to have that 4th-wall-breaking detail and it's cool to be able to use your favourite editor for an actual in-game goal, a less clicky way to work with the language would be much appreciated. I get that it's readied for mobile/touch use, but I can't imagine how fiddly that would be with an if statement with complicated terms.- The constant bobbing and weaving of the background. Luckily there's now a config setting to turn it off. But why there's no simple in-game menu for these things, I'll never understand.Being somewhat fiddly to work with is a bad thing for a game, even when it's programming, and it's easy to lose focus. Then again, the music stays on in the background and it taskswitches seamlessy, so why not check your mail every once in a while to clear your mind :)Anyway, awesome game again. Like always."

The UI and generally the gameplay of 7 billion humans is similar to that of HRM, with the difference the language you use to control the humans no longer resembles an Assembly-like language, but it is closer to more modern languages, like C++ or Java (but of course much simpler that the afore-mentioned).In terms of complexity, the challenges of this game are noticably more difficult than those of the previous game. The optimization challenges are especially very difficult and require you to think ""out of the box"". The humour of the game I found to be funny and I loved the constant references to automation and robots, considering this is the main ""theme"" of the game.In general, this game took everything that made HRM great and made them even better!The only thing I found somewhat annoying is the fact you are unable to copy specific commands directly from a programme you made in the game and paste them on a programme without deleting all the other commands."

Not sure if it's because I barely had any assemly language experiences before, I did find a lot of HRM levels a little challanging. Had to stop and think for a while before coming up with a solution. And the usual case is, as long as i could come up with a solution in HRM, I could easily pass through the optimisation&efficiency challanges without thinking. Things are a little different with 7BH. The levels (at least the early levels) are easier to pass. 7BH uses Object-oriented language, which is much more instinctive to use for human brains. I've only played the game for 10 minutes or so and now up to the 14th year. I could baiscally drag out a solution instantly after reading the instructions. But optimisation and efficiency seems to be an issue. At least i could not finish those two challanges with one go as I previously did in HRM.Overall I think it's much easier than HRM so far.

If that game isn't perfect in your eyes, don't even THINK about getting this game. Otherwise, give it a try!I've played quite a few puzzle games thus far - a lot of Zachtronics games, and some other lower-level games like Silicon Zeroes and Prime Mover. Human Resource Machine was one of  the first ones of these that I saw. It looked pretty neat, so I decided to pick it up. Despite having a clunky interface that's clearly made so it's easily portable to tablets, it was an alright game! So naturally, I was on the lookout for the sequel (this game!), and picked it up on launch day. However...It's a  totally different experience. Outside of the tutorial puzzles (about 20 of the 64ish levels), you're usually given a huge pile of data, and an amount of workers, and have to do something with that data. For example, one of the levels involves taking a line of datacubes, and putting them all into a shredder. This is a pretty straightforward puzzle - just think about how you'd do this with one person and one line of data:Note the location of the nearest shredderMove upwards until you find some dataPick it upPut it into the shredderRepeat ad infinitumPretty straightforwards, and those are usually nice puzzles to solve, since you can think of them as doing a simple task to some data like you do in HRM. I loved those puzzles! Some other puzzles include doing something on a set of data that's made easier with parallelization (the first sorting puzzle comes to mind)... however, there are other puzzles where parallelization just makes things worse, much worse.The main issue I have is that you have zero control over your workers. One of the puzzles requires you to write the numbers 0 - 99 on datacubes, in any order. You're given a 10x10 grid of them, as well as 10 workers. Pretty simple algorithm... or it would be, if all the workers started off in a line. They don't though, they're in a jagged line, which makes syncing them up an absolute nightmare. It's still doable, but just so... irritating.Another issue is that there's zero way to communicate between workers until you get to the last dozen or so puzzles, which is limited to ""wait until I hear this word"" and ""tell everyone/the person in this direction this word"". So you can't transmit data between workers, and you REALLY have to sync things up, because it works completely different to other ""transmission"" implementations.There's also no real ""fast forward"" button. There's up to x12 speed, but x1 speed is PAINFULLY slow. The solutions are measured in seconds (which is insanely ambiguous to the extent where I'm not going to bother optimizing puzzles), some of them take ~5 minutes to run at real time, which is still about 30 seconds sped up to full speed. It's just agonizing!You're also only SOMETIMES told if you do something wrong. One puzzle has you doubling a number digit by digit, and writing that sequence to a screen (1, 2, 4, 8, 1 6, 3 2.... and so on). You're not told if this goes wrong. At all. Given that this puzzle takes AGES to run through, you might be tempted to put it on full speed and grab a snack. Nope. If your solution goes wrong, you'll not know about it at all!The hint system is... awful. Only some puzzles have hints, and of those that do, the hint is usually just straight up telling you the solution, which completely ruins the fun!Thankfully, you're allowed to skip puzzles; you can have up to 5 puzzles skipped at any one time, which was nice, at least. Besides that though, this game doesn't have a lot going for it. I praised the dance cutscene in my previous joke review, and I do like the cutscenes (they're surreal in Tomorrow Corp's signature manner), but that's about all the credit I can give this game.

While HRM was single-threaded, in 7BH you need to move multiple operators to complete the objectives - which makes things more chaotic, and consequently, not always faster.The programming ""language"" is improved compared to HRM - while there are only a few additional communication and interaction operations, the ""standard"" operations are more usable, especially the IFs. There are still no loops and no subroutines though - both are problematic if you are an experienced programmer (you'll cringe at seeing your own solutions), and also if you're learning programming (you'll acquire some horrible practices). Best strictly treat it as a game.The challenges are also improved, the difficulty curve is nice and the later levels require some cogitation instead of mindless duplication which was such a significant part of HRM. Also, the game does a good job introducing some of the challenges of multi-threaded programming, and in a funny way.The editor is basically the same as in HRM - navigating big programs is still painful, and there's still no in-program copy / paste, but otherwise it's nice, intuitive and slick.

This tends to get very, very tricky - to the point where occasionally I had to call it quits and get back at it the next day. These challenges aren't impossible though and there are many hints or even complete solutions on the web in case you get completely stuck.The game is very easy to pick up and nicely polished.

I was excited about the idea, but the implementation of controls is just so lacking, that you find yourself just wanting to program it correctly instead of with all limbs except one arm tied behind your back. Just goes to show that there's more to making a good programming puzzle game than making limited controls compared to real life and implementing difficult levels.}After all that being said, I still look forward to whatever they make next. I love the developer's work since they used to call themselves 2D Boy, but I'll be more dubious about their next puzzle game."

Fortunately, the developers have you covered by including optional challenges to really up the difficulty. It's taken me 25 hours to complete the game with all the optional challenges, so it feels like money well spent (5 minutes of which was going back to get the killbot achievement :P )Recommended for anyone who enjoys the satisfaction of a well crafted system dropping everything into place. If you're the sort of person who wants to tweak things to perfection, you can definitely get your fix here. I've seen some complaints that the ""speed"" challenges are arbitrary on what ""takes time"", but I have to disagree with those sorts of statements. Invalid operations waste time and logic tests (e.g. IFs) are also slow to run... that all makes sense to me. My one complaint is that it feels like some of the speed challenges are most easily completed by simply writing many repeated lines of code. I slogged through them to get to 100%, but I could see people running out of patience and getting disillusioned with the optional challenges because of it."
792100,0,0,76561198031996920,359,73,1,34.8,"November 23, 2020","Description: 7 Billion Humans is an indie programming simulator released by Tomorrow Corporation in 2018, a sequel to their 2015 release Human Resource Machine. The game is able to visualize complex programs through the actions of human workers, adding a level of both engagement and humor to an otherwise boring genre. In this game you generate your own code by arranging pre-fabricated commands and logic gates while trying to complete the objective for that particular “floor”. As you ascend the tower you unlock more commands and other tools to use, while the challenges get progressively more difficult.Graphics/Art Style: Visually this game is nothing special, but it doesn’t need to be. Gameplay comes first in a puzzle game like this, and the unique art style creates an engaging environment to run programs in. The animations and visuals are clear, which aid in understanding what is happening during code simulation. There are very few cutscenes, but they are fun and humorous while describing the limited plot of the game.Audio: There is no voice-acting in 7 Billion Humans outside of a few cutscenes, which is a good decision. Not having voiceover or a narrator helps the player focus on the task at hand. Instead they opt for the Charlie-Brown-teacher method of voice acting, which adds a degree of simplicity and charm. The other sound effects throughout the game are clear and convey their actions well. Music: The music is surprisingly good. Most of the tracks are very mild and do not distract from the programming. Some others are more involved, but they are heard mostly in cutscenes and towards the end of the game.Controls/UI: The user-interface is very simplistic, which is a good thing. You select one of three program tabs then drag and drop the various program commands into the tab then re-arrange them until you have your desired program. There are some nice quality of life features, including being able to copy and paste programs between tabs. My one criticism involves the Jump command, which is this game’s method of looping and skipping around your program. Functionally it works just fine, but visually it can get very difficult to follow the arrows when troubleshooting large programs.Gameplay/Difficulty:  There are two primary facets to gameplay. There is a primary goal for each puzzle, accompanied by two optional challenges. They involve real world programming challenges: trying to complete the program in the fastest time possible, and also with the fewest lines of code. The standard challenges are balanced and paced appropriately, with difficulty and complexity increasing gradually as you go up each floor. The optional challenges can be exceedingly difficult, which is exactly what you want with optional content in a puzzle game.Replayability: Unfortunately puzzle games inherently lack replay value, and 7 Billion Humans is no exception. I do not see myself going back to play this game any time soon.Writing/Story: N/ALength/Price/Value: 35 hours played, purchased at full price for $15, adding up to 43 cents per hour. The game was paced well, and didn’t drag on at any point.Recommendation: I thoroughly enjoyed 7 Billion Humans. If you enjoy programming and puzzle games then I would highly recommend it. Even if you just enjoy puzzles but know nothing about programming this is a great way to learn the basics and have fun while doing so."

The idea of programming little men to do something is fun and allows you to learn many of the basic concepts of programming.Even those who already program will find some challenging levels but above all it will be challenging to be able to complete all levels with 3 stars.Obviously recommended only for those interested in logic and programming.

Mechanics are used for only a few levels instead of developed over longer stretches of the game.The game doesn't give you constraints on how complex your program can be. This is a problem for making the game fun, since _a_ solution is usually obvious, it would just be laborious to ""type"" by dragging the blocks in place. The main constraint is that the programming language is really bad, and inconsistent. You have a ""nearest"" command that remembers identities of people and blocks, but not the identities of walls. You can compare to blocks on the ground, but you can't calculate based on them. You can walk through employees sometimes but not always.The game offers constraints in the form of optimization challenges. The game doesn't really do a great job at making sure you're actually solving the task and not finding a way to cheat, which makes it less fun knowing you can sometimes easily get a ""better"" score by making a ""wrong"" solution.The speed optimization challenges are frustrating. Since there's no limit on program size, you're encouraged to ruthlessly ""unroll"" and ""inline"" to avoid extra calculations. The timings of individual commands are unintuitive, and so ""synchronization"" has to be done by just knowing the timings and not actually making something very robust.The space challenges are real challenges, but extremely difficult. I beat all of the levels in TIS-100 including ResearchNet, but couldn't bring myself to try the challenges in 7 Billion Humans; they were just too tedious."

Problem is: Those solutions are mostly high end ones getting so abstract, that it's hard to learn any lessons from them. I really want to know the standard solutions the devs had in mind for each puzzle so I can learn lessons the devs wanted to teach me with their puzzles. I hope I could try solving the puzzles on my own again that way. Instead I ended up in a death spiral - learning nothing anymore, only entering solutions from online to proceed. Quality of life is absent as well. Unskippable introductions to puzzles, an absolute copy/paste functions that only copies entire solutions and overwrites anything written before. No audio slider!?

It's not going to fully teach you how to be an engineer, but it's a heck of an introductory crash course in the basic concepts.If you like the idea of using a programming language to solve puzzles or want an introduction to the basic logic used, this is a funny and entertaining way to get it.

If like puzzles or like programing	Then like 7 Billion Humans	Else don't buy 7 Billion Humans; The only drawback I have to the game is that whenever someone watches me play it, they inevitably or invariably try to backseat code the puzzles.  Some of the puzzles get pretty complicated, after you solve the puzzle there are 2 additional challenges, one to solve it with less steps, and 2 to solve it faster,  Sometimes you can satisfy both at the same time, sometimes not."

Maybe there were ways to speed this up, but I didn't care enough to find them. There are simply better games to solve these challenges in."

792100,0,0,Tickle-Me-Elmo,208,68,1,9.7,"April 19, 2020","The puzzles presented here have a nice twist from the previous game in that you order multiple humans around. The difficulty is fairly high - especially if you try to pass the optimization challenges. Not all humans should do the same actions, but they all share one task list, so some code in later levels must be used to differentiate - that clutters up the task list.Memory slots and communicating signals between the humans further complicates things and written code gets really hard to read. Thankfully the drag-and-drop system is well polished and makes it hard to do the wrong thing or something destructive.The music can be disabled but the environment sound still plays, so the windows mixer must be directly used to mute the game - a shame since that should be an easy option to implement."
792100,0,0,CortanaDoomGuy,334,71,1,20.0,"April 18, 2020",Nice casual programming game during the lockdown for programming challenges and quirky humor. This can make you stressed out if you go for the optimization challenges to the problems. I just played the game to find a solution which works and did not go into the optimization route. Fun game if you like programming challenges. The interface though where commands are given is not as efficient as an IDE!! But the level is casual enough and in my 3 hour playtime till now U did not find any challenges to be too complicated to just get it working. The animations are great as expected from the creators of world of goo.This is not like any zachtronics games where the levels get too complicated later atleast until now and new commands get introduced frequently. Hope the difficulty is consistent as is during these initial stages which gives a fun and relaxing experience.

There's at least two reasons to be interested in this game, so I want to get into both.One major group is people who like programming. I'm a programmer at [tech company], and when I get tired of the sad programming I do at work, I like to relax with some happy programming, particularly in a game like this. And this game is tricky enough to really tickle the brain (parallel programming is hard, yo!). But if you want to enjoy this game you have to avoid the speed and size challenges. The game claims they are HARD, but what they really mean is the programming language is ESOTERIC and OPAQUE, which means the challenges are UNINTUITIVE.Maybe you, the reader, want to benchmark the language, google all of its hidden features, and find a way to turn the challenges into true puzzles. But for lazy folks like me, the challenges will be forever elusive, because the game doesn't give you the tools to understand them. Check out this thread https://steamcommunity.com/app/792100/discussions/0/1733210552679860283/ for discussion of a challenge where MORE instructions take LESS time to execute. (n.b. if the devs ever release a detailed manual or specification for the execution model, all of this is moot and I will change to a recommendation)What about people who have less experience with programming, and want to try something new? I still wouldn't recommend this game. This game is hard to get into; as of April 2020 less than 5% of players have completed it. The prequel, Human Resource Machine, is easier to understand, and probably a better entry point. Games by Zachtronics (like SpaceChem or Infinifactory) also teach you to think like a programmer, and they have much better documentation. (If you're into retro, games like Shenzhen IO and TIS 100 come with printable manuals.)
