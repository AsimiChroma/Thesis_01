0,2705,"It's nice and fun to get into, but it's got that enticing complexity that just makes me want to dive into it completely. I love it!"
1,2704,If(javaScript.isFun(you)){    const buy = this.game}
2,2704,"Look, I like programming, okay? Also, as a computer science student, as long as I get my work done, my teachers do not care for one second about me playing this. In fact, they love it."
3,2703,"The perfect game to keep your skills sharp or to create a whole new skill set. Screeps provides the rules for how your Creep colony sustains, and you must implement the code to support its growth. It is up to you to read the docs, test your code, and continually evolve/organize your code to find just the right solution to each problem you face.For more seasoned programmers/players, the fun really starts when you hit your assigned CPU time and/or memory limits. These limits are quite likely to make you learn something new about the game, programming, or both - no matter how experienced you are.Anyways, Screeps is an excellent game for anyone interested in computer programming at any level of skill."
4,2703,Excelent game for learning situational and automated programming in a fun way
5,2703,very fun but also educating. TRY NOW!
6,2703,if only I was smart enough to play this
7,2702,"easy to get into (with programming experience), nice API and - for me at least, having little previous experience with it - a nice entry to javascript."
8,2701,"I like the idea. I like the challenge. Still, I fail to write maintainable code in this game, and I have about 30 years of coding experience, so that is a humbling experience. That doesn't stop me from coming back and back, trying to figure out a nice coding pattern for managing my colony. I recommend it, but be warned that it takes quite a bit of thinking to get things working past the basic room :)Now, I'm off to try and create an automated road system with cached pathing for all routes."
9,2701,"fun, i write eveything in purescript then compile to javascript and it works just fine.  i would highly recommend if you are looking to boost scripting skills"
10,2700,I love the game omg
11,2699,Haz codez
12,2696,eehehe - uh oh
13,2696,is gud
14,2695,Do i like it? YES I LOVE IT.But its expensive... 100 for unlocked cpu ...
15,2695,"Good, if complex. Not a quick play."
16,2694,One of the greatest game ever
17,2694,"Too many work for simple actions, it will be better with community open code support and modding"
18,2693,"One-of-a-kind. Very fun, even when you're surrounded by stronger players."
19,2693,yes very very good yes
20,2692,Developer wanting too much money!
21,2692,My day job is a programmer. My game is programming.
22,2691,"Are ya coding, son?"
23,2691,"Best game to learn game development fundamentals if you already know JavaScript.Why JavaScript? this is because the game was created with this particular language, however there are ways to play with other programming languages they are not recommended if you are brand new to programming in general as they require a few workarounds with Node.js.Now that this is out of the way I can continue by stating this won't teach you how to make games, but it can teach you the basics of game ai and the game loop which are a huge part of modern game creation."
24,2691,"very fun but disappointing when you get destroyed by tigga, private servers are pretty cool tho"
25,2689,PE
26,2689,"Bad graphics but unreasonably addictive. Shard3 is filled with many players who have quit long ago, their ancient empires continuing to stumble forth on their own.Edit: After a hundred hours in, some issues are starting to show. The most annoying one are the vast number of lazy players who just slap on a slightly modified or unmodified open source bot and gain an unfair advantage. Wish there was some way to police it, because I put in hours making my code *good* and I have to face down someone who spent 3 hours in game copying bots from github."
27,2689,Has been a great way to work on my coding skills
28,2688,I so freakin love this game. - Still too much of a challenge to me but love the freedom to do and design what you can imagine.
29,2688,"Pros: It's a very interesting concept, and art is pretty niceCons: I could make a better game :D JK. But speaking seriously, devs here milk too much money from their playerbase. They really need to chill out"
30,2687,"I was not told that you need to pay more after buying the game.The fact that you can buy ""dlc"" to unlock CPU means jack nothing to people that didn't play the game."
31,2687,"As a retired coder, i was excited to see this sort of game. Alas, the business model is somewhere between incoherent and totally opaque. ""CPU unlocks"" bought on Steam don't show up in the game... I just wanted to take a look.... <sigh>"
32,2686,i'm not very well at javascript and some of programming software lol. but it is really great and fun game and i'm recommend this game for any programmer or someone who want to create AI. just try demo from website before buy it on steam.
33,2686,"#Discussions_QuoteBlock_AuthorScreeps is a MMO RTS sandbox game where you can learn, practice and improve your programming skills having a fun withthe most used language in the world, the JavaScript. The game has a lot of content, and its verybeginner friendly. They have a good support, and a great solid community behind the scenes. If you enjoycoding, I really recommend this game! One of the features that I should mention is flexibility, you canplay through a browser or client, you can play alone, or in official servers, community servers or youcan have your own server, which you can tune everything to your own way. Even talking about code, youcan find the files and use all them inside your favorite IDE. For VSCode users I have a suggestion, insome repositories on GitHub, you can find support to implement Intellisense for better experience. Ihope you enjoy the game, it worth each penny.Useful Links: Official Website: https://screeps.com/ Game Documentation: https://docs.screeps.com/ API Documentation: https://docs.screeps.com/api/COST x BENEFIT    There is no ""price"" that could represent it    Spare some money, you shouldn't lose this.

34,2686,"I was a fairly seasoned JavaScript developer before this... Or so I thought...Playing Screeps learned me that my code was horribly in-efficient and that I caused far more bugs due to silly oversights than I initially thought.All in all, I do enjoy this game quite a lot, though it may be very daunting for new players that don't have any experience with JavaScript."
35,2685,"Boring, pay even after you bought the game, and nothing interesting to it. Yeah sure, if you like to code you may enjoy this game, but I didn't and I enjoy coding."
36,2685,"Screeps is a kind of game I've dreamed about for a long time, but never found time to implement it myself. Ultimate programmer's challenge. Visually simplistic but it offers unrivaled possibilities for intellectual joy and achievement. Reasonably complex game mechanics are coupled here with real programming language and all power it brings to you. It might be a somewhat challenging for non-programmers to get into it, but for experienced programmers it will be non-issue. On other hand it saves players from predicaments of using toy languages lacking mature abstractions.I'am now 10 hours into the game but I'am only scratching the surface of it's tasks and possibilities trying to get my basic colony online. Even after few iteratons I see a lot of potential for improvements to my programs and that is just managing basic resource gathering and construction. Defense and conquer is still something for me to grasp and master.This is a great game for experienced programmers and for people, who want learn basics of programming and javascript."
37,2685,"Steep learning curve and I can only recommend this if you have some programming knowledge. I'm a working software engineer and I struggle trying to make this game work at times. It's a highly complex and rewarding experience.If you plan to play on official servers, this is kind of like an EVE Online plex model type MMO. You can run out of CPU cap eventually so there is an incentive to be efficient with your code."
38,2685,"First off, I liked this game, as a hobbyist Python coder, I found this to be an interesting way to branch my skills out.Secondly, and this is personal preference, but I think a more fleshed out tutorial would have been nice figuring out how to programmatically place construction sites was a bit tough, though I may not quite be at the skill level expected for the target audience."
39,2684,Excellent game if you like the RTS genre and programming.
40,2683,"Always liked automation games, this one takes it up a few levels more. COMPLETELY automate everything and improve your programming skills in the process."
41,2683,"Screeps is a Real Time Strategy game (RTS) in which players create minions called creeps that mine energy, build walls, towers, mineral extractors, etc. Build bases in a grid of players. Screeps does not hold your hand and you need to do a lot of research to play the game. Is it worth it? Yes. You can learn real world usable Javascript code since all code is done in javascript. Of course if you look slightly further, you can also learn Typscript since its nearly the same thing. The satisfaction you should get from creating your first creep, to mining to building fully automated bases and building economies that can support hit and run death squads. If you can write the code, the creeps will do it. To a fault. You'll find problems fast as your creeps are just as dumb as you programmed them to be. They're simple and only do what you told them. Every moment playing this game is pure learning and creativity. I'd recommend this to anyone interested in Automation games like Dyson Sphere Project and Factorio to consider the true coding experience of this game in comparison. I warn everyone again, however, THIS GAME WILL NOT HOLD YOUR HAND. Be prepared for hours of pouring over the internet and documentation and watching other people and reading their code. You're learning javascript now. Oh and there's a game. But you're learning javascript. You will be better at life after having learned javascript. It will be pain to learn javascript. You will feel like a god when you learn javascript (if you've not coded much before). You will be able to will your creeps to be born into existence and command them to build vast colonies to take over the shards of the ether. You will be able to trade with your allies for powerful drugs to buff your creeps. If you're looking for gameplay, this game has it, the thing is: you just need to write the code for it."
42,2683,"Imagine you favorite game: Legaue of Legends, Tarkov, Dead By Daylight, etc- this game is better than all of those. Graphics are the same though."
43,2682,"Default font is far too small to play the game comfortably and there is no way to increase it.For a game that depends on reading and writing code, this renders the game unplayable."
44,2681,"Play the free tutorial/sandbox online before you buy it.If you do buy it, don't get a subscription, just get the game on Steam and play in Shard 3. In Shard 3, everyone else is also new to the game (subscriptions aren't allowed). Once you feel comfortable, consider getting a subscription so you can step into the big boy shards.Oh, and don't worry about losing your base. Starting from scratch is just another way to write better code. It's fun!Side note: If you're considering not trying the game because you hate JS, there are bindings you can use to write in basically any other language"
45,2681,"Great game, helps you not get bogged down in JavaScript and definitely has addictiveness!If you can't program under stress, you'd better think your script through. The invaders (PVE & PVP) will come and if you are not prepared it will cost you a lot of resources.The game can also be ""played"" via the browser. If you're addicted, you can even get e-mail notifications about just-in-time attacks, and then quickly push code on the go. Provided you have enough skill.Great game, NO pay to win, the better code wins!"
46,2680,"I do like this game but I do not know if I can say I love this game. I wanted to find a programming game that would allow me to sharpen my coding skills which this game does do. However, I am not really a PVP type of game player. I still do highly recommend this game however. The game is just not for me because of the PVP nature of the game."
47,2679,This offers a good way for people to practice their JavaScript skills and it's really fun
48,2679,"This is a great game for learning and practicing how to use the Javascript programming language which is the most widely used language in Internet browsers. Even if you're already familiar with JS, it's a great way to challenge yourself by writing efficient and optimized code due to CPU and memory constraints that will require caching and other advanced techniques. The back-end server runs on Node.JS which is also widely used in server-side Internet services and is all open source making it another great learning resource. I've had a blast over the last 4 years battling others code vs code, highly recommended!"
49,2678,"It's not a game. It is a programming learning application. If not so you can't imagine how a game without SFX, BGM can have so many players. I would recommend this ""game"" but still I hope the developers can make it more like a game."
50,2677,Probably the only game with such depth and programming.
51,2677,"A really well done API; it almost feels like it's actually a part of JavaScript. The functions are optimized to the point of a casual player not worrying too much about efficiency, and the servers run as smooth as butter. Overall 9.8/10 would reccomendI've removed .2 points for the in range not working where it should under very specific circumstances, but I'm sure it'll get sorted out eventually."
52,2676,This game can be really fun. However I do not recommend to play this on a mac. Although the game isn't too intense it can sometimes crash on a mac. It is much smoother and neater on Windows.
53,2676,"Who wants to program Javascript?  Oh maybe I should ask who DOESN'T want to program in Javascript?  Hmmm???  Can you even think of anything you would rather do than program?Maybe get your teeth pulled?  Or visit your friendly proctologist?  Do your taxes?It really begs the question, why hasn't a ""do your taxes!"" video game never come out before...But here it is... in all its blinding glory and dripping with fun!  Program in Javascript like it's 1999 baby!Honestly, I avoided playing this for at least a year after buying it.  I just COULD.  NOT.  BRING MYSELF to playing a game involving straight programming in Javascript!But something motivated me.  I wanted something to force me to practice coding more - and this was just sitting here waiting to be looked at again.The game-play involves writing code that has no automatically persistent variables, that is called once every second (or however you want to configure the frequency).  The point is... your code will sort of work at first, but because the variables don't persist from one second to the next, a HUGE puzzle emerges that forces you to write some very clever code, and it does very quickly go deep down the rabbit-hole of writing something you can be satisfied with.This game is not for the faint of heart.  It is brutal.  It is brilliant.  And if you know anything about coding, it will hook you, if you give it enough of a chance to clean that first tutorial pile of  you wrote to make it half-way decent...  oh yes... you just can't help yourself...  Should you serialize everything into the persistent memory object, or can you have the objects rename themselves if they detect one got destroyed to prevent a melt-down?  UGH!The debugging tools are not obvious either - there is a lot of hit-and-miss and guesswork - I inspect variables by having the creeps say their values.  No breakpoints.  There is a memory map though, and I imagine that everything can be stored in persistent memory, but the game doesn't hand you this.  It's designed to run on a cloud-server that becomes a multi-player MMO of sorts.  I have only played it so far on my own private server on localhost.  And the map -- it's alive.  Sure on a shared server, other players will have code that keeps running 24/7 - while you ... no me... I'm frantically trying to debug my stuff!  Even running on localhost - the AI is consuming the map right before my eyes, while I fix coding errors, or try to re-write the algorithm for naming things.There is a very deep beauty to be found here.  But again... only few people will be able to see it or appreciate it.I can only say I am very grateful to have gotten far enough to want to keep playing.If  you aren't sure - the whole thing can be played for free from the screeps.com website - it just won't save your code and you'll be in some strange mode - but the game-play is there to get your feet wet.  Just close the ""Sign in"" dialog, and there may be some holes - but if you ask the community I'm pretty sure they will be very enthusiastic and helpful.UPDATE: What really gets in the way of enjoying the game, is the poor documentation.  Try to read about ""Memory"" and understand what they are talking about without asking anyone in forums.  It's impossible.  This kind of poor quality becomes a roadblock, because why should you, the paying customer, play QA to the developer's poor documentation?  You shouldn't.  And relying on tribal knowledge means an endless battle just trying to understand how to play efficiently.So I have to hesitate in recommending this.  Poor documentation in a coding game == ""don't waste your time""."
54,2676,"Screeps is like a weird mashup of Robocode and Warcraft (for anyone who remembers those), with some of the distributed programming concepts from Exapunks thrown in.  Instead of coding one tank to pit against others in an arena battle, you're tasked with coding an entire faction in a persistent MMO RTS world.  It's challenging to get started (I'm on day 2? 3? and have yet to build the defense towers teased in the tutorial) but enjoyable if you're someone who does programming for fun."
55,2676,"Won't teach you how to program, learn the basics of programming (Preferably in Javascript) first"
56,2676,"This game is god for programmers, overwise it will be hard for beginners."
57,2675,"console.log(""yes"");"
58,2673,"I *want* to like this game - it's super innovative, and I can (conceptually) see how it would be fun.  I went through the tutorial, but that didn't put me anywhere NEAR what I needed to know to write my own scripts.  It's entirely possible I'm just... massively missing something, but it doesn't seem like it.Tutorial 3: ""upgrade these extension points that we've already built for you"" - well, before you can build the extension points even in the simulation, you apparently have to claim the control point, but to claim the control point you need to build something that has the ""claim"" ability, which requires 600 energy, which you can't do with a single spawn point.  How do you build a second spawn point?  Not in the tutorial.Ramparts?  Walls?  Roads?  Not in the tutorial.I don't want to be spoon-fed, and the documentation is decent - but I'm someone that learns from examples.  Showing part of what's needed is almost worse than showing nothing."
59,2672,Very fun way to learn JavaScript. Gameplay has depth and the API documentation is great.
60,2672,This is a great way to apply your JavaScript in new and interesting ways.
61,2670,absolutely amazing game
62,2670,"There are not many games around like Screeps.  It provides a rich environment that the players share.  You interact with the environment by writing code.  The most similar game I can think of is Core War: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_War The tutorial system provides a good introduction to get you started, and the forums provide answers to many of the questions you'll have when learning the game. Beyond the basics, the team has provided a rich set of game mechanics like additional resources beyond ENERGY and a market system for trading that allows you to continually have interesting progressive challenges."
63,2669,11/10 would recommend
64,2669,I would have loved this but unfortunately it is java script.
65,2668,I really like the game. It hardly stagnates.
66,2668,"Easy to start, nice to beginners, hard for ""hardcore players"""
67,2668,"Very fun, great that one can use programming languages other than JS too (like Rust)"
68,2668,Ideal game for off-grid players.
69,2667,"The game devs may decide to intervene and destroy your rooms.I was attacked by a player named ""o4kapuk."""
70,2667,"Iwas told about this and now I'm addicted. It has every problem you could want and can be as complicated or simple as you want. Enjoy the Game, But I'm at 25 Hours in 2 days, now it's back to work, but man I'm starting to plan out everything after getting my feet wet. Pretty Cool Game, Want to learn software, it's really good there too...Like Puzzles, Algorithm Creation Can be a huge Puzzle."
71,2667,i love my screeps.only complaint is i wish the API documentation expanded and showed more properties
72,2667,Loads of fun! The UI elements have a lot of small quirks/glitches that are annoying but the base game is great! I got some basic scripts running my creeps and love watching them execute!
73,2667,"I learned JS only to play this game and I have to admit, that it was totally worth it!Once you get a taste on how to code ingame and use the features of JavaScript, you just don't want to stop.There is always something to code (either a new role of creeps or optimizations).So be aware, its really addicting!For everyone interested in playing on a local server, I would recommend you to follow those instructions: https://github.com/screepers/screeps-launcher as the steam-local-server is way too inefficient.If you need any help, ask in one of the slack-channels in screeps, where you will mostly get an answer in a couple of minutes.Buy this game, hang it on learning the JS concept and you will have a lot of fun!Cheers ;)"
74,2666,"if you hate javascript as much as i do, that's okay because you can also use typescript.amazing game, but you have to have a few spare pounds of grey matter to actually have things run efficiently"
75,2665, JavaScript    
76,2665,"Kind of interesting - my bf tried to make me love this game, but I didn't understand what to do"
77,2664,"I like this because I'm learning about JavaScript but if you can't code, you will have to learn about it. It has a steep learning curve and I wouldn't recommend it to beginners if they just want to play aside from learning. You'll only get frustrated just like my first time."
78,2664,fye
79,2664,Javascript programming game.  Unique idea - great interface for this!
80,2663,"I think, all things considered, this is my favorite game of all time. It really is incredibly well done. I don't think I'll ever get bored playing screeps, always something new to do. Some new strategy to implement, process to optimize, etc. You could probably play for thousands of hours and still never really ""master"" screeps.Basically it's an open-world RTS MMO game where everything is controlled by the code you write. Nothing ""just happens"" on it's own. That being said, the floor/barrier to entry is moderately high. Plain and simple you need to know javascript, and understand how to use an api. You'll be fine if: -maybe javascript isn't your ""bread n butter"" language, but you know something else. You can pick up js syntax rather quickly. -you understand programming fundamentals (functions, data types, lists, arrays, loops, etc.) but haven't coded in a while.-you don't know  but you're interested and willing to put in the effort to learn. Screeps has an extensive docs page for api reference, so that's super useful. There's also a super active slack channel with people who are willing to help, talk strategy, whatever. If you're thinking about picking this up, I highly recommend it. I'm actually surprised it isn't more popular than it is, but seriously hats off to the devs."
81,2663,"Screeps is the hands-on programming side project/challenge I needed to relax and get my head out of the daily work business, where time pressure, legacy code, refinements, politics, strange business expectations, changing/fuzzy priorities, and what not are distracting.In Screeps, you are kind of forced to explore different code architectures, it encourages you to improve your language skills, it helps in setting clear, reachable goals...I truly believe that ""playing"" this game makes you a better, more well rounded programmer. It also includes most if not all aspects of modern tech projects, like deployment, testing, debugging, caching, etc. The complexity quickly becomes challenging (at least for my skill level) and I see myself digging into topics like pathfinding, job scheduling, state machines, performance optimization, dynamic and conditional configuration, tradeoff and priority systems, and more. The more experienced players that have already well developed codebases are an inspiration in a large sense, but also in tiny-decisions like number of body parts on a creep to start with.Especially the fact, that your own code holds the knowledge you have learned so far about the game is really awesome. No one take this away from you, even if you get wiped from time to time, you only get better, if you are willing to analyze your weaknesses and take the time to step by step improve. Very addicting!The community, specially in Slack, is really nice. You can feel right away in the type of conversations, that mostly people with some life experience and respecting manners are talking as ""professionals"" to each other. Helpful, sharing, open for discussion and scientific improvements, with less drama, bashing, spamming or other immature behaviour you often see in other multiplayer games. I also like that the Screeps developers themself are approachable and give their best to interact with the community on a regular basis.So, I guess, I have to thank the Screeps developers for giving me a framework to become a better programmer and have fun doing so! Thank you!"
82,2663,The best programming game.
83,2663,"If you can code in Javascript or want to this is a great game to pickup and for the steam one off price well worth it, there's plenty of beginner friendly areas as well."
84,2662,"If you're the kind of person to be happy delving deep into a system created by game developers, and you're fine with spending loads of time reading documentation and watching online tutorials to grasp the basics, before being able to construct your own massive systems, this game is brilliant. The time you spend on it early on is worth the benefit of having your own systems to tinker with, and having such an in-depth system in the game is amazing for people that like games such as Factorio, where creating a massive unnecessarily over-complicated conveyer belt of operations is satisfying, but for the people that would rather boot up a game and have clear goals and steps right in front of them, I would suggest passing on this, unless you want to try and make an exception. The in-game tutorial isn't really clear on everything that you could do, and how everything works, so reading 99% of the documentation is non-optional.Also, just like some other people, I spent a lot of time programming in the web browser with Sublime Text open on another monitor, so it shows 9.4 hours played lol"
85,2661,scripting goes brrrrr
86,2661,"A very time consuming game, with very little to offer for inexperienced coders (if you compare a high end players code versus a low end players code). With enough time, nerves and ideas, Screeps should get you a long way (considering the amount(...) of respawn thoughts i've had). Get's very brutal, very quickly if you get stuck on code for a longer period of time.For any new player, I'd(...) suggest reading and going through the tutorial very carefully, and with attention to details.Update: Was good when it was new, these days it's just pure hell / crap, company policies suck.https://screeps.com/forum/topic/3177/quiting-screepsNutshell: Too scammy."
87,2661,"Bottomline. This game is for those who love to write code, especially JaveScript or Typescript. If you don't, then the game is not likely to be fun for you. Its is not designed to teach a novice how to program, but it could make someone better. The learning curve is steep, but there are several good videos on youtube that can jump start a player in just a couple of hours.Like any game, there are players who are very helpful, and then there are a select few that use new players as target practice, wiping them out as quickly as they can find them. Just keep in mind, its just a game, and your real life is not impacted. You can make alliences with others players to help out."
88,2660,it make me brain smarter
89,2660,"I don't know, the game is a tower defense, super simple on graphics, it seems don't have sound, just code you ""AI"" with javascript, I think there is better games alternatives out there in the same category. I was looking for the single-player/offline feature then when I feel ready do the MMO part, the store say is included but not really, technically there is ""single-player"", you start you own local server and connect to it, yet if you think you will ""code"" offline in your ""single player"" (local server), it won't be like that, you need to be online, so forget it if you are traveling with no internet in a hotel, train or whatever reason (I travel frecuently). In addition the game use a slow database for your local server, lokijs, give you bad performance for the ""single player"" experience.The game seem ""kinda"" low level, for some people maybe is good for other dont, if you wanna play something like this go for Spring engine [1], love2d [2] or any other game engine and do you own AI, even if you are learning because this game is kinda similar.Recomendation before you buy, go to the main site and do the ""Live Demo"" [3] you need more than two hours to get used and how to play, finish the Tutorial then play the Training/Survival. Play all you need to help you decide to buy the game. Read the documentation [4] yes the Gameplay and Scripting seccion.The game is slow, on you local server you need to change the tick duration, do this from the server CLI use system.getTickDuration() and system.setTickDuration(200) lower is faster.So that the same thing doesn't happen to you as to other people who at 3-8 hours no longer like the game.Overall: Do you recommend this game? [] Yes [x] Neutral [] NoLinks:[1] https://springrts.com/[2] https://love2d.org/[3] https://screeps.com/a/#!/sim/[4] https://docs.screeps.com/"
90,2660,"Screeps is basically a tower defence game, where you get to design all of the tactics and strategies using real-world programming techniques, with the ability to change the behaviour of your units on the fly. While the game can be a bit slow at times (read: glacial) it is also mesmerising. I find myself spending hours just staring at the creeps moving around, looking for little improvements I can make. In a sense it is also an incremental game, in that there is a lot of action required early on to get your little army up and running, and that required action slowly abates as you develop better and better scripts for your units. If you like tower defence, incrementals and computer programming then this game is definitely for you."
91,2660,"Screeps has a very interesting gameplay, the heart of the game is to program an AI to perform the proper tasks, in addition to having fun, it is a game that stimulates the learning of programming logic, I am a programmer and I loved the way the game approaches the use of programming logic in an ideal way, neither so simple nor so complex.One thing that frustrated me a lot (I felt the need to talk about it here) is the way the mod @artch handles the topics covered in the game forum (https://screeps.com/forum/) I think one of the goals of the game are teaching, and having a moderator who answers the questions in a toxic way ends uppushing away anyone who wants to learn or even give an opinion about the game.Apart from this little detail of the dev team itself, the game is perfect"
92,2660,If you enjoy writing code and then optimizing in competition against others ... you just can't beat this game.
93,2659,"I enjoyed this for a bit but ultimately wasn't satisfied with the experience. I'd prefer that the game was more abstracted and not so low-level. If I'm going to put in all the work of programming my entire game, well... I might as well program my own game."
94,2659,I played this on my Windows Computer and enjoyed it so I thought I'd try playing it on my new macbook and I couldn't even get through the tutorial without it crashing out several times.
95,2658,"The concept of the game is pretty cool - programmable creeps that do your bidding, but poor documentation, a bad user interface, and limited interaction that isn't command based makes it a pretty bad experience overall. The built in programming tools leave a lot to be desired - expect no live debugging and to do almost all debugging by printing text to a console window."
96,2657,"First my hours on this game are inaccurate as it can be played, and I primarily do play, through the browser. This game is for the problem solvers, engineers (amateur and otherwise), and hackers. If you like being presented with a problem and exploring possible solutions to see which works best for you, you want this game. You play this game by programming in Javascript, but this is not a game that teaches you to program, except incidentally as you learn to make your scripts better. If you do not know the basics of programming (basic operations on numbers and strings, different types of variables and control loops, functions and objects) and how to do those in JS go learn that first, this game expects you to know that on your own. Once you know that, this game gives you really fun opportunity to practice doing those things! I'm not going to rehash the description of the game, but if the description of the game sounds like fun and you already understand the basics of writing JS, I can't encourage you enough to jump in and try writing a basic script and see how quickly you change your mind to think ""If I reorganize it this way that will let me..."" and then you're hooked doing late night coding sessions and not even getting paid except in personal satisfaction."
97,2657,Unique and interesting
98,2657,If you like programming and like RTSThis is a must buy.
99,2657,"I have played lots games over the years. have forgotten 95% of them, 4.9% of them i remember due to them being an excellent game and myself enjoying, Paradox games  I love but dont rate as in the top .1%.  Only a very rare game has me remembering epic or defining  moments that really set that game apart for me.  EvE online is one,  for creating a sandbox of such freedom, politics, warfare, resource gathering, trade, which all helps to create proper player driven stories. The other is Screeps....which has given me my most proud moments in any game i have played. The games are of course markedly different but also surprisingly similar. Screeps like EvE has trade, crafting, factories, land ownership,  politics/alliances, resource gathering, warfare, but ants instead of ships and where in EvE when u get killed you take a big loss, in Screeps it can mean game over, time to respawn from scratchagain. EvE has been called spreadsheet spaceships, but Screeps isn't excel inputting....its proper coding.  Im not going to lie and say it's easy, well for some developers it might be, but for the general person like me and most of steam players it is going to be a challenge but a challenge that is conquerable and will maybe like me, give you the best moment in gaming and something that you will remember, and also help develop to a number of different skills in the process.I have always had an interest in AI and have always wanted to design or play a game that resembles life to an extent. Something where you design your own creature to whatever you think would be successful and then with other players set them free in a world to see which become the dominant species.  In short that is Screeps but you can tinker with them along the way, constantly evolving them,  creating better logic that only the limits of your capabilities, mind or JavaScript hampers. Your part in the world at the beginning feels very bare and lonely. In a room within countless other rooms. Getting your ants spawning correctly, gathering resources and expanding the colony are all WOW moments and then OH moments when your fledgeling colony dies off to your bad programming. There will be lot of these moments, well there was for me, but keep tinkering and before you know it you will have a successful colony which now needs more space.Getting out of your room into another felt like getting a spaceship into space..colonising a second room felt like the moon landing The crafting/factories and boosts to make your creeps stronger can be mined and put into labs to make stronger components  or bought/sold on the market to other players. My defining moment in the game so far, and my most rewardable moment when I finished the code to get my ants to mine a random resource that appears in rooms at times. Power mining I looked at and wondered how I would manage that, looks so complicated and thought it would take me months to do it. I actually got it to 95% working in one day, and although even now some outliers gives it troubles at times .1%, it works a dream and will happily do its thing all day and night.  The game gives you challenges, challenges that will give you a better 'I done it' moment than any other game out there, at least for me.Most players are very friendly and especially on the free 20cpu limit steam server hostilities are limited. I have a lifetime subscription but I dont use the main servers and just play on the free shard, the game is easily playable with just the steam purchase and no further costs. However they have just started a seasonal server which is active for seemingly 2 months at a time, at the end winners are declared and depending on where people finish awards and prizes are given. I have code that runs all aspects of the game now but it is a mess and lots hardcoded so it's difficult to use when expanding or starting afresh. I am using the seasonal server to develop my automatic codebase, where hopefully in the end I will just be able to place a spawn and then leave it alone for 2 months and see where I end up. Any new player I would say to join the games slack channel, similar to discord, and also look out for players that help others with YouTube videos and their own servers/discord channels.  I won't name names here as they may change in time, but asking in slack for assistance will get you plenty of offers.If you have any interest in AI, programming, logistics, logic or even ants do yourself a favour and try it out, it might surprise you."
100,2657,"If you think you'll like this, then go for it"
101,2657,Nice
102,2656,"Upsides:             -Your creeps run 24/7 even if you're not online             -The amount of free CPU you get IS ENOUGH to run ~10 rooms(6 months to 1 year of gameplay) despite people saying otherwise and you can still play even if you're at 10 rooms, you just can't expand much             -Teaches you basic parts of JavaScript although it wouldn't teach you how to write an app on it's own             -Teaches you code optimization             -Active devsDownsides:             -It is still a subscription game and if you are a very big player, you are going to run into CPU problems without a subscription             -Starting out can be tough, but is still doable"
103,2656,"I think this game is great, I haven't really delved deep into it yet but the basic premise has captured me.really before buying consider two things, if you are completely new to programming/coding will you be willing to spend time learning about it to play this game and do you like the idea of an MMO RTS.keep in mind you do not need to be an expert/professional programmer to play this game but you do need to understand at least the basics and bit more of the Javascript language. This game is also a great way to learn the fundamentals of programming coupled with tutorials outside the game. if you wanted to get into programming this would be a great way to start instead following a tutorial series printing stuff on a console you actually see results but again you will have use sources outside the game to really learn everything you need to play."
104,2656,Overall a complicated but super interesting game. It helped me a lot in learning to program while in college. Not a standard strategy game but definitely fun!
105,2656,God gob!
106,2656,"Never thought i could have so much fun learning to program, I actually forgot that I was learning something until I realized I had learned many somethings. More people should get into this game, its a hidden gem!Dec 11th Update:I'm loving this game more and more as I learn, and now play via web browser signing into the screeps site with steam, so my hrs on record are not accurate in steam, I've played at least 5 hours a day since I got the game, even though the pro's can chew through me easily at the moment (thank god for novice areas and safe mode). Its a PROPER challenge!"
107,2656,Would recommend to programmers from beginner to advanced level. Astounding game.
108,2656,"once you get into it, its really fun... 300 hours later :)"
109,2656,if you're a coder you must at least take a look
110,2655,One of the best coding games out there.
111,2655,"Great playground to practice your JavaScript programming skills, including graph theory algorithms and AI."
112,2655,My perfect game
113,2655,I absolutely love this game!
114,2655,"It really is a good programming game! It's the best I found after numerous research. Other programming games aren't as modern, well-designed and fun as this one. Highly recommend to play around for JS dev."
115,2654,"Very fun game if you're willing to challenge yourself to overcome obstacles. I went into the game knowing minimal programming and zero javascript. Now, a week or so and 80 hours in, I know minimal programming and minimal javascript.9/10"
116,2653,"This is a great game but if you are new to coding, get a notebook to write down your codes in. It will come on lots of help if you forget some code."
117,2651,Keeps getting better!
118,2651,Time to rewrite everything for the 12th time. 10/10 content
119,2651,"Good game. Watching all your lines of code and hard work finally pay off as your creeps move is incredibly satisfying. Cool community, cool idea, overall a very cool game."
120,2649,Great game if you like to code.
121,2649,uwu
122,2648,Javascript doesn't deserve such a good game to be made in it!
123,2648,.
124,2648,It's like Skyrim but with code.
125,2647,"If you a programmer, this game is so addictive."
126,2646,I have been spent many hours coding something that barely qualifies as an AI and It was a blast
127,2646,"This is a solid game. The tutorial gives you enough code to work with that you can start building off of it. There's always something more to optimize, however. As you progress, you'll have more to handle, and there hasn't been too many times so far where I don't know what else I could make better.The game moves slowly, which lets new programmers fix their mistakes in a timely enough fashion, which is great. Most super tricky code is handled by the API (Pathing), which really means it's beginner/intermediate friendly. If you want to get more acquainted with Javascript, this is a great way to go. Also do yourself a favor if you start this game and set up GitHub to back up your code. If nothing else it's a coding portfolio addition."
128,2646,Ir's awesome.
129,2645,"Awesome Game! :)Seriously, I really love it.It is helping me learn to program, by adapting my knowledge to a real-time usage of code in a challenging environment. :D"
130,2645,"TLDR; Painfully slow, unenjoyable, not a good way to learn programming.In summary,if you're a programmer: It's easy and very boring. You'll have more fun watering your plants.If you're not a programmer: You might learn a thing or two, but it's JavaScript so why bother.Take it from an experienced programmer. You don't want to learn JS as your first language.The game is SLOW and I mean SLOOOW. It's not good for learning because testing your code might mean running a simulation that will take several hours or days. A web dev can just hit refresh on their browser to test their code. I was also disappointed that the game basically does all the pathfinding for you, but ah well, probably should of expected that.The MMO side of things i'm sure bothers a lot of people, but the real tragedy is there is no singleplayer feature or sandbox mode to trial. It's very unbalanced and trying to experience any of the game's later features and content is just too tedious to bother. Constructions are very costly, when you start out just one tile of road will take an hour or more to build (And that's if you're running the game ten times faster on your own simulation). The game's performance is also extremely poor considering it's meant to be for programmers I was fairly shocked to see how sluggish the game was.It's a shame, there is a pretty cool concept here but the game's performance is too poor to run faster simulations, which would make things far more interesting, especially online. Seeing months of simulation in a few hours would be a lot more fun. It takes weeks to really see the end result of your scripts, maybe months. Not worth your time and efforts. This is like trying to learn code in the fifties."
131,2644,Its a fun game and you get to code that the same time ^^
132,2642,Really good game for programmers. I improved my skill  in JS
133,2642,cant uninstall  game
134,2642,Great way to learn or improve your javascript skills
135,2641,"Great game if you want to improve your programming skills. My experience with programming was very limited, and this game gave me a nice start and motivation to keep improving."
136,2641,This is terrible. People will kill you all the time. The comuntiy sucks. Dont play.
137,2640,"I love games that reinforce real-life skills and I have yet to see a game that does it as well as Screeps.  As a beginner JavaScript programmer, Screeps taught me to read documentation and understand programming in a way that exactly matches real life.  Now I play for fun when, as a manager, I feel like I'm at risk of losing my programming edge when speaking to my web developers.  On top of all of that applicability, the game has a lot of actual depth.  I've played the game since before they were on Steam and it's come a long way.  Now decorations that you can build?!  (and sell on the Steam store, lol)  Neato!"
138,2640,"cute idea, poor delivery. having done basic game development, the code you are writing is along the same lines. They are having you write your own game in order to 'play' a game. I'd rather just write Java and have a real game than do this all in Javascript."
139,2639,its ok
140,2638,Put a lot of hours into this game back when I was getting started in javascript.  Learned a ton and the little the feeling of seeing your creeps do what you programmed was great.  A lot more established players but still just as fun.  If you die you just spawn again but better this time (hopefully).Lost time to play after a long while but revisiting it again and decided to start from scratch.  Much different coding methods and performance and still all the same joys.
141,2638,"Honestly, this game feels like a way for the developer to create a renewable, recurring, revenue stream for himself from parents getting on the ""games to teach coding"" bandwagon. The tutorial consists of just copy-pasting code, documentation is alright at best, and the game heavily focuses on trying to get you to buy CPU unlocks and play multiplayer. That's not a way to learn any game, least of all a coding one. More missions related to specific actions would also be nice. The private server is complete ass, and unless you go full mongoDB install, something that's very much a ""You're on your own"" territory area, you're not likely to be able to find better. It's less a game for programmers and more a game for linux enthusiasts that have MongoDB experience and an interest in coding around the shortfalls the game currently has. Oh yeah the code editor and console for the game frequently crash even with largely default code. So that's a thing. The editor is serviceable but the crashes that can suddenly find you having what you were working on reset is infuriating.The most rewarding parts of playing this would be screep-management but the more fulfilling ""starter"" type goals to help you get started and get better are already handled by routines already baked into the game in a very black-box fashion.Terrain management would also be cool, but terrain is hard-baked and cannot be changed."
142,2638,This game has been a great tool to help me learn to code and it's super fun.
143,2637,"When I first started the game, I was so lost. I almost didn't give it a chance. I read the other reviews and somehow, they were all positive. Based off that, I gave it a chance and then I started to understand the code. Go through the tutorials slowly, and apply what you learn there. Then you'll be hooked.(This is a game for programmers. If you don't enjoy programming, you will not enjoy this game.)"
144,2637,"This is currently my favorite game! If you enjoy RTS's AND programming, then I literally can't think of a better game for you =). If you are like me and you have ever written your own bot to play a game (usually against the rules) then this is also a great fit for you (all the programming fun with none of the guilt from breaking the rules lol).The official servers can be a bit slow, but I think that's to be expected. I think this game is intended more like an idle game (you write the code to make your screeps do the best they can while you're not playing).In some other reviews, I heard some concerns about new players getting wiped quickly, but I think they've fixed that now by adding ""novice mode"" (I just started 1-2 weeks ago, and not a single player has attacked me during that entire time! - Likely because I'm being protected by the barrier put on you during for first ~2 weeks)"
145,2637,"Screeps is a good game for learning to problem solve using programming. If you're not already experienced with at least one high-level language, you may want to start there first, as it was nearly impossible for me to play when I first purchased this game about a year ago. Do not recommend this game for having fun, as you will be utterly crushed by other players who've built algorithms 100 times better than anything you will come up with when you begin. You can, however, make a private (localhost) server where you can practice to your heart's content without other players obliterating your progress.Important things to note before buying:> Playing online requires a $130 down payment or monthly payments of ~20$ (not worth)> In-game language is JavaScript, if you're a JS hater you'll hate this game> User interface is occasionally slow and buggy> The integrated interpreter/compiler is not great> The API is really cleanly documented, but it's HUGE so you'll likely spend more time learning the API than actually playing the game> Do not play this if you're not interested in coding, as that's 99% of what you do in this game and you will be overwhelmed with information"
146,2636,it's ok i guess idk
147,2636,"Amazing, scary fun and I can't stop playing it"
148,2636,yes
149,2636,"If you like programming and want to play a game that involves programming this is a great game for it, As it actually includes javascript programming, you probably know enough to get started without much trouble."
150,2635,Just 10/10
151,2635,This is a briliant game/sim for programmers and people who wish to learn but need something to remain motivated. Screeps is this something. I am just scratching the surface (i.e. learning the API) but I have to say I'm  hooked :)
152,2635,"Not for the faint of heart, but this game is excellent!Starting up is hard (Send me a message, I might be able to help!), but once you manage to get through the initial moments of the game, it is awesome (and hard!)"
153,2635,"I recommend this game to every programmer and script kiddie I know.   It was good 2 years ago, but the development team keeps working on it, keeps trying to make it more palatable to an ever evolving audience.  Did you know that while the default language for this is Javascript, you could write your modules in RUST?  Yeah.  And it is a free for all, so sometimes people lose their rooms because they have coding bugs or can't keep up with combat.  But you keep all your code, so you just respawn somewhere else and start growing again."
154,2634,Grab a stock program then sit and wait for someone to wipe you out. Pass
155,2634,"First couple of weeks were amazing. I had to try out so many new strategies to optimize the economy, that the game was fun even without PVP. The only thing that could probably ruin the game is the ability of the grown players to defeat you in a single swipe, but... it is not a roguelike? Your code still stays with you and starting a new game feels different each time, your colony being smarter and smarter. I think the game is about constantly making progress, tackling optimization tasks, even if the place of action changes."
156,2634,A great programming game if you want to do a personal project while being able to see results relatively quickly. Has a very dedicated community and excellent documentation!
157,2633,"Great to learn to code in general (along with a tutorial), or to practice coding more complex AI, either against other players  or solo (in simulation or on a private server.The community on GitHub and Slack is great, too. Lots of starter kits, open source code and tools to make it easier, or more advanced!"
158,2633,.
159,2633,"- git gud- ""gud"" is not a valid git command, type ""git help"" for more info"
160,2632,"Screeps is a really interesting game for people who enjoy creative problem solving with code. There are so many things to optimise - you will never really be 'finished' with the game since you can always improve your code. The CPU limit means doing everything efficiently is important. It's immensely satisfying when your code works and you see your army of creeps working together.The difficulty of the game is basically proportional to how good you want to make your code. For someone who has never programmed before, Screeps is probably going to be too much of a challenge. Then again, the documentation is really good, and there is a good support network on Slack. If this is the challenge you need to learn to code then go for it, but it will not be easy. I recommend doing some online courses or something on JavaScript first. An intermediate/experienced programmer is likely to get a lot more out of this game."

I would recommend the game to anyone who likes to code or wants to learn how to code.  Great game in general."

Finally deploying a piece of code and seeing all your screeps behaviors change is far cooler than it has any right to be. I recommend setting up a private server to learn the game then moving your AI to the big-boy public servers."

176,2629,"Screeps, for someone like me who enjoys both RTS games and CS, is a combination which I certainly did not expect to find on Steam, but it is certainly a welcome find. The game combines the difficulty in strategy/tactics along with programming and creates a new beast which you scarcely see(with the exception of those of you who have participated in some of the Battlecode competitions( tl;dr, it is similar to Screeps but games are changed up each year but it is only active for a limited time, link here: https://battlecode.org/). The only negative side I see to this is that the game itself isn't fully opensourced, so programmers can't reverse engineer it and make their own versions of it with different approaches(I believe with the game as it is now, any reinforcement learning approach is unviable, and it would be interesting to approach it from that perspective). Regardless, Screeps has my unequivocal thumbs up."

The game combines the difficulty in strategy/tactics along with programming and creates a new beast which you scarcely see(with the exception of those of you who have participated in some of the Battlecode competitions( tl;dr, it is similar to Screeps but games are changed up each year but it is only active for a limited time, link here: https://battlecode.org/). The only negative side I see to this is that the game itself isn't fully opensourced, so programmers can't reverse engineer it and make their own versions of it with different approaches(I believe with the game as it is now, any reinforcement learning approach is unviable, and it would be interesting to approach it from that perspective). Regardless, Screeps has my unequivocal thumbs up."

204,2624,Very hardI will genuinely learn a skill from this 'game'
205,2624,Must play game for every software developer
206,2623,"NOTE: I have entry level experience with JavaScript through Codecademy, but fluent in several other computer programming languages, and was an IT professional for 20 years (programming, systems admin)NOTE: The review is based on running a private server in order for me to spend more time learning how to play the game without using my online time.This is a game I would not recommend anyone getting for several reasons.The first and probably most important one is that interest in the game is waning.  A check of the official server user count, as well as the user count on community run servers is barely 3000 in total. That's a serious  consideration when one wants assistance in understanding the game. The forums also are rarely updated with new questions and those that are (including one I posted, but was forced to figure out by myself after nearly a week of zero responses) do not get an answer. Would you want to invest time in a game where hardly anyone is playing it? I would probably balk at that.The second is the choice of language used to program the Screeps in question. JavaScript.Seriously?The industry is trying to get away from continuing the use of JavaScript in front end applications. The mentality that JavaScript is a good programming language to use is culthink. It has had problems since its initial implementation. It continues to be problematic in the later ESx releases. The language's most notorious glitch of silent failures and the requirement of a linter (a tool that analyzes source code to flag programming errors, bugs, stylistic errors, and suspicious constructs) has made it the butt of jokes. Working with JavaScript is akin to walking in a minefield.  Don't even get me started of using function callbacks in order to perform an array iteration. You know, something languages like Python do not require and are native to the core implementation.I'm not against the idea of using a programming language as part of a game mechanic. EXAPUNKS from Zachtronics uses a machine level programming language in order to make its critters move around, but the language is native to the game. Why is this important? This ensures it works with the game! It also ensures it's easy to learn! JavaScript has never been a programming language for beginners to learn, and because of this the tutorial does not really do a good job explaining what's what. I mean, telling someone to go to Codecademy to learn an intro to JavaScript -- which incidentally is not very good -- and copying and pasting code to make the bots move isn't a good way to learn, particularly since the Screep specific objects and their associated properties and methods, are not well explained at all. Locking the game into the JavaScript language also takes away the ability of the game to evolve organically. The mechanic cannot change unless JavaScript changes, and from the look of recent ESx implementations is not changing in a good way.If you want a game that implements programming as a game mechanic, I would recommend EXAPUNKS. This game probably had a pretty good run during the heyday of JavaScript but like the language itself is on the decline. Save your money and buy something more current with the times."

208,2623,"This game is truly only for people with 100IQ. If you think you can program then you are wrong. You will get frustrated, but glued to your keyboard because you want to quit and play something more rewarding and at the same time write your code complete just to see your ant colony thrive.This game so far is no bs. You are as good as your code."
209,2622,"This game is simply awesome. If you are a novice programmer or want to learn the basics of programming this i s a great and fun way to start. If you are an experienced developer, this game is a great opportunity to build complex behavioural patterns, architecture of the management of creeps etc. I highly recommend this game."
210,2622,"If you are someone that likes to challenge yourself  and have a bit of programming experience, then this game is for you.  It is a great way to improve your programming skills and imagination.  There is of course a lot of good coders already playing, but that is what makes it fun as it will be a challenge starting of.The Support team and Devs are great.

216,2619,"This is a great game for developers that want to push their limits and see how they stack up against other coders. It is all about making the right algorithm, but beyond that there is a great deal of stress on writing efficient code. You can either write ultra-efficient code, or pay for more cpu time - this just makes sense on so many levels.Love it!"
217,2619,Awesome!
218,2618,This game is fun if you like java scripting an interesting problem.
219,2618,A game with so many prerequisites and for a particular audience exclusively can not be recommended. The implementation seems very good and for developers it certainly is a nice game but overall it is not user friendly.
220,2618,Great game if you like programming as a hobby.
221,2617,"I'll update as I go. Learning Javascript as I go. the possible complexity is supplies motivation to build a stronger knowledge base on the flow of code. I love the game play. It's extremely simple(graphics-wise) but that's ok, the FPS is not the focus."
222,2617,"This is a great game for everyone who loves programming and games. Even better is the fact that you write code in real programming languages (JavaScript, but you can theoretically switch to something else if you want). One of the challanges you will face is that you need to optimize your code since every player has a limited amount of time (CPU time) in which your code needs to be executed (You can buy a subscription to increase the time. This has some very fair mechanics too and you will still need to earn more cpu time)."
223,2616,"Good game, recommend it. Subscriptions suck though, I already bought the game and than I need to pay more for some reason. Should be included"

229,2613,Ridiculously addicting for such a low-attention game. It's like an ant farm but with AI you wrote yourself.
230,2612,Game provides a space for innovation and thoughtful strategies. I'm been studying languages just to get deeper into this game. Since the game can be transpiled in other languages the options are much greater than just plain Javascript which most games like this have as the only option. Glad I supported the game and the developers who created it.
231,2612,more people need to see/play/create games like this

233,2612,"I'm not sure whether to recommend this game or not. But given all the negative points I can come up with, I decided not to.First, some positve nodes:-Very well documented API-Nice simple tutorials to get you started-Provides a neat motivation for writing some code as a hobby and maybe gain some coding skills And now to the negative:-Requires monthly fees for unlimited gameplay-Slow user interface-Bad integrated code editor-Very slow gameplay on the official servers-Very hard for new players to hold their ground-Due to the slow gameplay, there is very little to interact with in the game world. There is just not much going on, but trying to harvest energy as efficiently (cpu and costwise) as possible.-Now way for new players to survive once the 'Respawn area' security expires. There are always bigger fish around you with so much more spawning power and energy ressources available.Let me tell you some story of my Screeps experience:At first I really liked the game. Progress was slow but steady. There were some new things to explore and to tackle code wise, like efficient mining in neighboring rooms or even in npc controlled rooms. Generally writing code for automatic exploring, building and maintaining your colony and rooms. But the further you get, the less things there are to do.You are always limited by the amount of creeps or bodyparts you can spawn in your room in one creep lifecycle (1500 server ticks) or by the energy available to you in that room. So you can't just try out everything that seems interesting, like battling your neighbours in the respawn area or trying your hand on boosting creeps with stuff you would almost always have to buy via the terminal. Because if you do that, you can not use this energy to upgrade your room or build defenses.And the respawn area will expire eventually. For me, it was 14 days. In this time, I managed to get up to GCL 6, which means I could own 6 rooms. I did own 5 in various room levels. My main room was at level 7 and I had one other at level 6, when the respawn area was over. At the same day, a long time player with GCL ~40 and all the ressources and rooms this comes with, wiped out all my rooms. Of course I could delay them a bit by activating a safe mode. But this only delays the inevitable, if the player which attacks you has compared to you just unlimited ressources and can energy starve you.That's it for me. It was some fun while it lasted and I probably would have kept playing for some time since I hadn't explored everythinbg the game has to offer. But there is simply no way to hold your ground against the big fish in this sea, which is why I won't start over again.-"
234,2611,"If you like programming, this game is amazing. I can't say how accessible it would be otherwise, but I have lost weeks to this game already, and I don't see myself stopping anytime soon."
235,2611,Great for programmers.
236,2610,"if you know a little about Java or some other program language and want to try and code an AI then this is a good ""game""   Grinding + coding"
237,2610,It's awesome. Nuff said.
238,2609,"Great game if you enjoy solving problems in javascript, or REALLY enjoy it in other languages. Once you progress at the game more, you can create more complex algorithms for handling more robust automation for scouting, defence, and production.Good practice for optimization as well."
239,2609,"I waited a long time to get this game, because I didn't know JavaScript and I wasn't sure if I was up for it (I had some programming experience Java and C beforehand). After awhile, I discovered the free tutorial/simulation of the game on the website and decided to give it a try. They directed me to a free JavaScript course online, which I did a few lessons on and then went back to Screeps. I got through the tutorials and felt good about my abilities, so I bought it. I have been playing non-stop since, but it doesn't feel like a complete waste of time, because I'm learning a new language while I'm doing it."
240,2609,"Very fun and educationable. I reccommend going all-in and installing node locally, with a linter etc, and uploading code to github, makes it even more like a real job."
241,2609,"Screeps is a ton of fun if you have a ton of time. It will definitely sharpen your javascript skills but it won't teach you anything you wouldn't learn coding other javascript projects. (By that I mean you're still going to google solutions and look at other code to learn.)The multiplayer sandbox approach is interesting and when you're not competing against the Open Source libraries on the public servers it can be a ton of fun. The Open Source libraries just ruin the public servers. I understand the purpose of Open Source libraries but I don't understand what satisfaction players get out of it. This is easily resolved by setting up a private server using the open source code available from the Screeps team. <3If you're playing on public servers the game will encourage you to spend over $100 for a subscription to remove your CPU limitations. This limits how much code you can run and turns the public servers in to a pay-to-win game. Rentable servers, for those that can't setup their own server, would have been a better approach to increasing the games revenue. I'd gladly pay for a private server where me and my friends can play without cpu limitations and competing against the OS libraries.At the time of writing this review I've put over 137 hours in to the game, have owned it for less than a month, and Screeps Arena is not out yet. I am, to say the least, a little obsessed with this game. Even with this obsession I still find the game lacking. I love writing the code but it can seem pointless at times. (I think Screeps Arena will be better about this since players will most likely be writing their code to improve their Arena ranking.)I feel if the game provided some direction with a campaign, similar to the beginning tutorials, where it provided challenges that we had to solve by adding more functionality to our existing code-base it would give this game not only a great direction but it would add so much more learning to the game!I'd love to see a Campaign. I'd also love to see some sort of objective-based head-to-head battle where players are actively writing code to compete with their screeps in real-time.I can't wait to try Screeps Arena and hope they continue to develop more games like this!We need more games like this!"
242,2608,"Fun for programmers at least, needs to be more games like it out there. As for players that aren't programmers that want to get into the game it can give them a bit of whiplash but there are ways for them to play too. :)"
243,2608,Reasonable learning development opportunity in certain ways.
244,2608,"As a game, I can't really recommend this title. Unless you have a few programmer friends and a private server, your progress will be glacial. The official server runs on a very low tick rate. This makes sense, since it's being offered as a free server, but the result is that a week goes by before your little colony gets off the ground. And it'll be months before you are meaningfully interacting with other players.That said, as an exercise in Javascript programming, Screeps is great. It's a fun way to keep you JS skills sharp."
245,2608,"I like it. I'm a data programmer for a living. I didn't know JavaScript but I know other languages. It wasn't hard to pick up JavaScript. If you're thinking about buying it but aren't because it's not in your preferred language, give it a shot anyway. It's satisfying watching your code 'live'."
246,2608,"play at your own risk. If you enjoy computer programming and RTS games, you will sink many hours.  my wife left me shortly after buying this game."
247,2607,This game is great.
248,2607,Great game.
249,2607,Not many MMO's let you put the game down without losing progress.
250,2607,Fun great game if you want to learn to program and learn Javascript this game is for you.
251,2606,bruh
252,2606,"Game it's a Chromium browser. It runs like sht (no acceleration enabled?), you can compare the performance with the tutorial in their site and ""in-game"".The game started as a game browser, but i think that's just a lazy excuse to use JS.(1)All your creeps are in a ""map"", i prefer them in a array, i had to do a workaround but that's fine.Yeah, this is not a game to learn JS, but it should be!!, JS is a convoluted language and looks different from the other OPP languages.The game should have it's own language, and should have it's own linter(1).The games invades your browser to use it as a console."
253,2606,"This game is one of the most amazing games I have ever played. While there is not a lot of action early on, I have been looking for a game like this for forever. The ability to write real code that makes your creeps do things is just amazing to me. I've wanted to create a game similar to this for a long time so that I could play it, but then I found screeps and I'm having a blast. It is helping me write cleaner code, more optimized code, and its helping me grow more confident in searching online documentation to learn something new. If you are a beginner to novice programmer, this game will not only be fun, but the game naturally forces you to write better code over time. A must have for any programmers or programming enthusiasts!"
254,2605,"Realy, realy fun way to learn javascript. Creating ""simple bots"" that later can work together to collect resources, keep buildings running and (later) work together to fight enemies."
255,2605,"This is my current favorite game. I'm normally a java developer, I have some NodeJS under my belt, but I'm not a wizard. The skill floor for this game I would say is you do need to understand the basics of the language and you will quickly find that you have to write clean and modular code that is constantly refactored in order to get far - as in out of the very first square you spawn in. By the time you are out of the first room I think you can take a step back and be proud that you effectively wrote your own, mostly unique, AI. Once you solve one problem, it's up to you which one to tackle or prioritize yet. Nothing tells you what to do - what to build, optimal parts compositions for which roles you decide to create, attacking or defending, mining or building, etc. As a programmer, the Game's API is easy to grasp, but difficult to master."
256,2605,"If you've got any experience programming in an object oriented programming language, you'll probably enjoy this game."
257,2605,Very nice game to learn programming
258,2605,"Quite an interesting game. If you enjoy coding, you'll enjoy this game. I suggest setting up an IDE and joining the slack for the best experience."
259,2604,it's okaaayy..?to me it feels like an open-ended computer science assignment and it just makes my brain hurt trying to understand the documentationbut it's okay because the concept is just so creative
260,2604,Good motivation to learn some Javascript
261,2604,Really fun and learned a lot!
262,2604,"The concept is verry interesting, I also like learning this new language. As stated by the developers, having some programming basics in A language is a must before beginning programming in screeps (Me having difficulty while reasonably experienced in Python and VBA). As there is definiately room for improvement in the screeps documentation and help files, I really like the concept and look forward into further development."
263,2604,"If you know how to code and want to create your empire of creeps, you should probably buy this game."
264,2603,hard but rewarding
265,2603,"This game got me started learning programming. Note: It didn't teach me programming, it only kicked me hard enough to get out there and learn. This is not a game for new programmers, this is a game for people who already know some programming. But if jumping into the deep end helps you get want to get out there and learn, that's what this game did for me.I can proudly say 2 years later, that I can very nearly play this game. I would entirely be able to if I learned Javascript rather than C#, but they're both similar enough that this is a pretty fun way to learn Javascript after already knowing something similar."
266,2603,Great so far. Better incentive to learn to code. And i enjoy such games anyhow.
267,2603,"Basically the only game worth playing, ever."
268,2603,"The tutorials take too long. I would rather have a book, or a cheat sheet or checklist of things to do. When tutorials stop me from clicking around I leave."
269,2602,yeah even though complex hard to understand
270,2602,Yes.
271,2602,If you a programmer or even if you have some small experince in software this game presents several interesting challenges and has a casual pace worth putting a bit of down time into.
272,2602, this is amazingBut hardbut amazing
273,2602,"Inredible game with a huge diversity of possibilities. You learn to code and think logically very fast. Also, it teaches you how to learn new modules, APIs or any other extensions quickly. Also, I enjoy this game so much."
274,2601,"its programming your own Ai. Fun for people who like to program,.... or can ctrl+c/+v and then you have an ant farm"
275,2601,"Great game, I've supported it for a long time.Now I program all day AND night."
276,2601,this game eats all your time to fix javascript bugsits great!
277,2601,"If you're into programming unit AI type of games, you'll love this. Worth every cent!"
278,2601,"great game, ok documentation, bad optimization.no wait, thats my scripts.."
279,2601,"Amazing concept, it really helps improving coding skills and thinking carefully on optimizations. Watching your ""robots farm"" working as you intended is incredibly rewarding, leaving your base unattended and then coming back an checking everything keeps moving and working is just great. There is a lot documentation to read though, a lot of time coding, it becomes frustrating at a times but that is what builds the feeling of accomplishment at the end. Definitely not a game for everyone, if you are a software developer as me, you'll have a lot of fun and you'll lose track of time easily. On the other hand, if you want to get things fast and can't envision yourself spending hours or even days coding that particular state machine you need for your unit to do what you want perfectly, then you are going to get really frustrated. You really need to like coding to like this game.For a very specific audience, it's a gem."
280,2600,You have lots of little Roombas. They have no code to tell them what to do. You write that code in Javascript. The goal is to automate everything and make your roombas survive all hostile roombas. Great game for learning programming skills in a fun way!
281,2600,"I like this game very much.Who doesn't like programming + fun together and then replace it with a school project so, that you don't have to do gamemaker. Every programmer who likes programming would want that. The games gives a sensation that every line of code is your little baby and that you need to care for it. It gives also a wide range of possibilities to do just that. From your mobile, to every computer in school. You name it and every modern computer or device can run it.The wide range of possibilities in the game gives you a non-stop sensation. It feels like you can even take over the world. In conclusion: I like the game. More that I like my family (jk: just a good reference how good the game is)."
282,2600,Do you like to program? Do you like to think as opposed to spam clicking? Maybe this is the game for you.
283,2600,"Bastante divertido y ayuda a tener mayor familiaridad con el concepto de programar, una mejor interfaz seria agradable."
284,2600,"I still don't know what I'm doing, but I like it"
285,2600,"This is probably the best ""programming"" game I have found so far. The use of real JavaScript (specifically Nodejs 8.9.3) is a huge plus. The in-game IDE is also surprisingly good and perfectly serviceable, though it lacks a few features that would be nice (directory support, dashes in filenames, improved syntax checking and error reporting). The gameplay loop is also really interesting - the ""bots"" (creeps) that you program run 24/7, so you are constantly progressing (as long as your code works properly) even while away from the game. A great game to play in short burstsThere are some stability issues with the client. The game will occasionally stop displaying creep movement and requires an occasional restart. This probably not a good choice for a complete novice at programming, but I write JavaScript for a living and have been really enjoying it"
286,2600,"Screeps is about programming a liittle robot civilization to survive and thrive. If you have no programming experience then this could be a nice way of learning. But there is quite a bit of depth in optimizing your workers, fighters, explorers, economy and so forth - even for experienced developers."
287,2600,Good game for programmers
288,2600,Very good.
289,2600,"I've been looking for an online coding-oriented game for a long time - there have been some that have gotten close, but ultimately they were very limited and had mechanics too removed from the actual programming aspects.  Screeps does it perfectly.  Just to give an idea of how much I've been enjoying this game, I normally only game on weekend nights, but I've owned Screeps for about a week, and have already put 52 hours in.  Granted, a number of these hours are me monitoring my little bots as they work, but I find myself constantly making little tweaks to my algorithms to make their behavior more and more effective.  The API and documentation are also really well done - it's obvious how much time and effort the developers put into the planning of the Screeps architecture.  I would suggest this game for both new and seasoned programmers alike.  To put it in perspective, I've been coding about 30 years (many of those doing it professionally, including now)- and I never feel limited at all.  Though Javascript is not one of the languages I usually code in, I'm actually glad they used a prototype-based language, it allows for a lot of versatility in your designs - you can really program in whatever style suits you.  There are lots of tutorials available for new programmers as well, and even though you might not have the most efficient code, you can still have a ton of fun experimenting with different ways of doing things - all while improving your skills.  And the fact they have built-in Github integration is a great idea as well, it's definitely a game made by folks who understand what people want in a programming game.Keep in mind what this game is not though: there aren't fancy graphics, and it's not fast paced.  And even though it's accessible to new programmers, you definitely will need to put some time in to get the most out of the game.  However, if you do put that time in, it's really rewarding to see your code turn your tiny single creep setup into a huge energy mining operation as the days go by.  I 100% recommend this game!"
290,2600,"I like this because it it uses JavaScript in a fun way. You can right some code, and then see how it works really quickly. It combines to fun things together"
291,2600,"time sink game watching your creeps do their things, fun creating something and try to make efficient code"
292,2600,Really nice if u want to get into (node.js) javascript but u don't have a project to practise with.
293,2600,"I'd recommend this game to people who want to learn or are familiar with Javascript. I've been doing software work for years and have limited time to invest in this game, but really felt like it has a bit of a learning curve due to how you can approach different aspects of the game. You can easily just smash some things together and get some results, but you then need to get your creeps working better together. If you just start with the tutorial scripts you end up with a backup at one resource node.I'll note that I can't be a good judge of how hard it is to learn as I am not a novice engineer, but I believe if you are dedicated and use the tools available to you that you can learn.Still having a blast and have not left my first room. Finding out how much more I can do in just my one room gives me a lot of time to put into the game just with that."
294,2599,One of the best programming game out there.
295,2599,"Screeps is a wonderful use of my time, honestly.I enrolled in college January 2019 for Development. I've been in IT for 11 years. I'm beginning a career as a Web Developer. This game, more than anything else, helps me reinforce my JS. It helps learn about an API and how to use it. There's a lot that it does for me as a Developer.That said, there's not a lot that it does for me as a gamer, especially when I'm this addicted to Apex.Still, all I want to do at the end of my day is launch my little private server and refine my AI.Definitely worth it if you're in the field. Definitely worth it if you want to learn JS.Not a game for people who aren't interested in JS, though, for sure."
296,2599,"a bit hard to get into at first, but once you understand how things work its great. can be played in languages other than javascript, but i recommend staying in javascript. they have an official Atom IDE package that has really helped me"
297,2599,"Honestly pretty decent game altogether. Good depth, lots of progression available, and seeing the fruits of your labor is definitely satisfying as hell.That said, I can never find myself going far in it, as the game always feels slow, even in private servers where a high tickrate is guaranteed. It just never feels smooth; even the menus feel unresponsive. Add on that the game's built on Javascript, Lord of Cruft, so unless you wanna spend a bunch of time fiddling to get something sane like Typescript set up, that won't likely be smooth either.Still, if you're just looking to scratch a programming itch in an RTS environment (a combo that I still think works fantastically together) and can forgive the bumps, this will do a good job of that."
298,2598,After the frustrating whole 5m of getting used to the docs. This game is just addictive.
299,2596,awesome game for curious engineers and programmers
300,2595,"EDIT: TLDR of comments below: I spawned near a jerk, game documentation isn't the greatest, wish there was a neutral on the recommendations. Your millage may vary.Pros:+learn some coding+can be fun for programmersCons:-pay to win (kind of) (there are benifits to paying vs not paying)-Nukes-Power screeps-healing modules are unbalancedTLDR:Game is Currently pretty much Pay to win, with Nukes and Power screeps (a Hero unit) being easier (a few days vs months) to obtain when paying extra money, and healing modules heal more per module than attacking modules. Nukes: Nukes have 0 counter play once you get targeted, there's nothing you can do to stop it and it basically 1 shots everything (including the spawn), nukes can even be fired on mass currently playing in the official server and in the process of getting nuked, I'm only about 1 week into this world and only have 1 room since I'm getting CPU capped from not paying, so this play through is donePower screeps are hero units they added later, the only way to get them currently is to level up your Global Level (player level) which is impossible without paying for a subscription.Healing modules currently heal 12 per module per tick per use and can be used on the bot that has the healing module, the ranged attack only does 10 damage at a range of 3 and the melee module does only 30 point blank, so when you have enough energy just slap a ton of healing modules onto a creep and watch it tank everything for all eternity.PS: HAHA jokes ""other players on par with you."" maybe my coding but not progress."
301,2595,"You can really design the mechanics of your units here.Scout? Miner? Transporter? Melee fighter? Ranged fighter? Healer? How fast? How damage resistant? Any mix of the above functionalities? Just pick and choose the parts and program the spawner to spawn a unit. Then you get to program their behavior, in Javascript. I don't know any other game that will give you that option. You can build roads for faster movement, containers for resources, fortifications, defense turrets, walls.You can place them by hand, or you can write a program that will place them. You get to program the logic for your defense turrets. How do they select target? Do they wait for them to get closer for better damage, or do they snipe them from afar at a great energy cost? As far as programming games go. This is a great one. Highly recommended if you want to work on your Javascript in a context of strategy game."
302,2595,All ur base ar belong 2 us!
303,2594,"This game is great, a lot of fun  to do."
304,2594,"i always saw my time playing game as a waste of time so finding a game where i can actually learn more programming stuff is quite nice, so a big plus from me!"
305,2594,"With a background in programming and a little exposure to javascript, this is an easy game to pick up, difficult to master. Screeps' designers have carefully given you the tools you need to build an automated empire, but with just enough constraints to keep it from being trivial to progress. Every new stage in the game requires some rethinking of your strategy and your codebase. Bootstrapping a new colony is different from building it to a self-sustaining city, running creeps in a single room is different from roaming about the map, and defending yourself from NPC raiders is different from building an army to conquer your neighbors.The new player experience is forgiving, with just enough safe time to get yourself established before needing to worry about other players. Even if things go horribly wrong, starting again from scratch isn't too difficult. And if you've written your code well, it's mostly automatic, anyhow.Screeps is challenging and fun."
306,2593,"This is a fantastic game for people who want to learn how to program in javascript. I've already gotten a colony started with harvesters, builders, and upgraders; they aren't the smartest creeps in the world, but they are my creeps. I haven't yet created a creep that actually knows how to fight, my creeps are still learning how to build and repair roads.  The game has a few flaws, it won't teach how you write code effectively, you have little more to go on than the api reference, a wimpy built-in tutorial, and a swedish guy on youtube. You might also lose to a player who doesn't know the difference between a variable and a boolean, because it's not hard to just copy and paste someone else's code.If you can look past these minor quibbles though, you have an excellent learning tool right here."
307,2588,great now i gotta learn javascript
308,2588,"I'm bad at coding and have barely made a shoddy functional base once, but i still have a crazy amount of nostagia for this game.  That said, not everyone will actually like the game.  It can feel like work for the wrong person."
309,2588,game good game make head warm
310,2588,If you want to brush up on you javascript skills and enjoy RTS games this is the ideal game for you.
311,2585,"Awesome, game, it improves you programming skills, and you are able to program with es2015!!"
312,2584,"This is a great game--I am a beginner/moderate hobby programmer and I was able to pick this up fairly quickly--the documentation is decent enough to get you started, and the community is awesome. I would seriously reccomend you join the r/screeps subredit as well was the screeps slack channel to help jump over questions."
313,2584,"Excellent game. I got into it when I needed to pick up Javascript at work and it helped me get fluent while having a lot of fun.If you want, you can run your own server and have it run faster than the official server to get quicker feedback on the result of your code.It would have been nice if they allowed the newer Node module import syntax."
314,2584,"Wonderful game that is both challenging and interesting. If you're a programmer, definitely go and try it. If you're not a programmer and would like to learn how to code - this is a wonderful place to start (and continue afterwards because you can improve the AI of your swarm forever). Bought the full subscription to support the developers as much as I can."
315,2583,Rewrite your scripts. They are not good enough.
316,2583,I don't know if the game is worth it if you are buying it at the regular price. Especially if all you are getting is 20 CPU (which can do a lot but not a lot at the same time). I think it is only worth it if you pick it up at a sale (like I did) I got it 50% off which I think is more reasonable.All in all if you are an experienced programmer it is a fun game and I recommend it!Also the documentation is good.
317,2583,"Good game.Is it possible to introduce some interrupt mechanism?When some event happens(like creep being attack, API call returning error), user's registered interrupt handler will be called with some parameters at the beginning of next tick. This could make programming much easier and save CPU resources. We generally uses polling to run a state machine or detect invasion, but interrupt is a more efficient way."
318,2583,I am a god~
319,2582,"Seems fun, but it's kind of boring for me."
320,2582,"I would recommend the game to anyone wanting to learn JavaScript, or the very fundamentals of Object Oriented Programming, as the very fabric of the game is programming little robots to (pretty much) do your bidding. I have enjoyed trying to solve many bugs in my time playing Screeps. I like the aspect that for public servers, your Creeps (as they are called) are always working. (There's no such thing as Offline in Screeps!) Enjoy Programming!"
321,2582,It was grreat until my AI developed a hive mind and tried to take over the world.Still fun thou
322,2582,If(You want to code)    Buyelse   Don't
323,2582,Great game with well put together tutorial and doco for beginners.
324,2582,"Brilliant game for those who know javascript, and great for those who want to learn in a fun way!"
325,2582,Very cool fun little programming game. I would recommend to have atleast a bit background knowledge about programming at all before buying this little gem.8/10 would buy again
326,2582,"I've never realized how complicated writing AI and accounting for edge cases can really be until playing Screeps. Even in a pretty simple and straightforward system, there's so much room to learn and optimize. I highly recommend for anyone with some coding experience already."
327,2582,"Really neat idea for a game, but it really sin't for the faint of heart. This will not help you learn javascript, you really need to know how to code beforehand. The documentation is pretty spotty which makes figuring out exactly how to do certain things difficult, but it also feels better when you do figure it out."
328,2582,Great way to learn JS!
329,2582,"Having done quite a bit of programming in other languages, I always avoided Javascript for JQuery which was just for me a much better option to choose when creating big PHP driven sites.  When I saw this ""game"", I thought ok, let see if I can carry over what I have learned here.  For the first couple of days I sucked!!!    My creeps kept dieing and my code looked like it was hit by a tornado.  Until you start to get the hang of it.  There is quite a learning curve.  You should be able to read code and you should have some coding knowledge.The best option is to start with the tutorial on the screeps.com site, watch some YouTube videos.  Learn how the API works and then start building on that.  It helps to have a IDE to maybe do your coding in just to help with the syntax error checking, the in ""game"" one is fine, but lacks in syntax checking.  Yhea that comes from being spoiled by using good IDE's. Also having some YouTube music playing in the background will help keep your sanity while you find that finger generated bug. To see this as a game is weird, I think it is a very good tool for teaching coding in Javascript.  Having a lot of fun with it.  Will recommend this to anyone with prior coding knowledge"
330,2582,"MMORTS for programmers. Interesting concept. The good thing is you don't have to be online to defend well. Game time (ticks) are bit too slow though, so you have to wait quite a while for something to happen."
331,2582,This game can be very daunting to a beginner but is a very fun way to hone your skills.
332,2582,"if (isProgrammer) {
    return ""Recommanded"";
} else {
    return ""Why not try it"";
}"
333,2579,"I came into this game knowing nearly nothing about javascript, and left it knowing not much more but being a lot more conifdent in my skills and learning to use the tools I already have. Now I'm coming back to the game with much more knowledge of the program, and having lots of fun NOT COPYING YOUTUBERS. Never copy youtubers, because they have very different programming styles and meshing together their random bits of code is actually harder than writing it yourself. Especially when it comes to LoDash."
334,2578,Awesome game to learn JavaScript. It was always hard to get coding but this game helps :D
335,2578,"So I figured out that the creeps can publicly speak by doing a say(). I play with a couple friends from my work. Well...I had this amazing idea to have a new creep role called role.heckler and this role will choose one of my friends from a list and wander into their room shouting insults at them until the creep dies of old age and is respawned to then choose a new friend to heckle. So now, whenever my friends get home from work and crack open their laptops to check on their screeps colony, they sometimes jump for joy when they find that they have been blessed with my heckler creep.This pretty much sums the game up. You can do anything you want and it's a ton of fun with a group of friends!"
336,2577,"if you don't know basic programming, go to freecodecamp.org, go to curriculum,  close the ""responsive web design"" arrow and you will see ""Javascript Algorithms and data structures"" complete that then buy this game. you have to put in every little detail of information for everything in this game. save you the trouble before you buy, go to the link ^^ and study then buy this game. cause it really is awesome(da bomb). if you don't like a challenge walk away go buy some hero clickers or something of the sort."
337,2577,"Really good, fun to program. Abysmal performance. Need to onstantly reboot the game in order to be keep framerate under a second.Only javascript? I wish I could code this in something like C++. No IDE support,no profiling help. The game is super performance oriented with the CPU time limit but has no tooling or language support to help that."
338,2576,Amazing game where i wish i could  code...
339,2576,"Their website was NOT registered using the fine services provided by GoDaddy. But through the major disadvantage this must have put them at, they created a well-documented bot AI mmo nonetheless."
340,2575,"Really, really cool game, wait - environment how to learn developing autonomous algorithms :)"
341,2574,"I love it! It's very fun, though I wish I could use C# or C++. Well worth setting up TypeScreeps in VS Code!"
342,2572,"Catch me in room W2N27! This game is super addictive, with fun for both coding and non-coding players. You can either use an open-source bot, or code your own, to control a room in an MMO world. The API is super easy to use, the in-game community is great, and you can either spend every waking moment on it, or look at your room once a month. This is great fun for all players with a basic knowledge of programming, and is quick to pick up. Just a note: try it in simulation before you play to be able to jump right in, and be ready to play in shard3 after the one-month free trial or fork over more money to play in the first three shards (zero-indexed). Not that shard3 is bad, and in fact it is the real test of optimization, which arguably makes it more fun."
343,2571,"It's super tedious, but necessarily so. The biggest gripe I have is there is only one language to choose from. The other issue is, the big conglomerate open source projects will always crush the little guys. But don't worry there's plenty of fun to be had learning to program, or even as an expert programmer just sketching out creative ideas.  Since i get paid to code all day, itfeels a LOT like work though, and for that reason it's a pass for me. But if you're trying to learn code I say go for it."
344,2571,"If someone is reading this...PLEASE SEND HELP, I CAN'T STOP PLAYING!This is getting out of hand, I need your help now.Help....Please...11/10, buy this game now or don't"
345,2571,"9/10As someone who has used JavaScript/Node.js for a while it was less of the language but the API that was a challenge, but a welcome one at that. I recommend familiarity with module.exports but overall a challenging and wonderful game. I would quote it as ""Similar to a mobile idle game that you can program yourself."
346,2571,"Good , high effort start though"
347,2570,"This is the only way to describe this game.Weaponized JavaScript.I'm using it to learn JS, and it's going..... OK. I'm not ready to play on the public servers with the pros yet."
348,2570,Expected it to teach me code. Didnt expect to have no guidance at all. Whats the point. I can go learn it elsewhere for free.
349,2570,I just discovered it.Awesome game for people who like both sandbox and programming styles.There is an available CPU subscription to unlock more power processing for your scripts.But don't be afraid of it because you can play on the limited-cpu-for-everyone server (or go ahead with it to thank the developpers if you have extra money to throw away) .The server is open-source so you can customize it for your needs if you don't want to play on the official server.
350,2570,"Might be a nice idea. But the sluggish and flaky UX is taking all fun out of it for me. :( For example even in local simulator mode ticks only occur every 5s where they should in 1s. Or if playing online commited code changes show no effect, and no indication of the commit failing. Its a lot of those 'small' things which don't let me trust the UI and make it more cumbersome than fun. I hope to get back to it once it is more polished."
351,2570,I have good fun with this game. Don't expect to win though. Many people have spent way more time writing their code than you. Have fun with your own progress.
352,2569,"Highly recommended for All levels of programmers, including people that just want to learn programming. This game is an absolute GEM. Shame it didn't go popular like the other games. I just found this game and I'm literally addicted to it. SO MUCH FUN! SO MUCH PROGRAMMING!SO MUCH GOOD!"

354,2567,I'm new to javascript so I started with a tutorial on Youtube. This game is a fun reason to learn the language. I highly recommend it. I would start on shard 3 if I was just starting out. I have 3 rooms right now and I think I could still have that much on the free server(shard 3).
355,2566,"Step one: Watch the trailer. Cool mechanics, right?Step two: Play the tutorial. Seems easy and interesting enough.Step three: Try to play offline to not get rekt by pros. ...Everything is 1000 times slower then in the trailer. it takes an hour to build your first storage tank.(One of the simpliest buildings) Step four: Your gaming computer overheats and makes loud noises. Open task manager... ""Wow JS is an expencive language to run"" 30% processor usage and 1GB of RAM(and the code is still really simple)Step five: You decide that it is time to go online. ...Everything is 3-5 times slower then offline.Step six: Realize that you probably have something better to do then to wait an hour looking at your screeps walking from point A to point B so that you can build a storage tank.Step seven: Open you actuall programming project and start working."
356,2565,"Best game ever!!!I've only been playing it for a few days now, but I love it!  I'm 100% new to scripting, but I was looking for a game which you get involved in the behind the scenes architecture of the game itself - writing AI or structuring the characters of the game and the story-line yourself ---- all the while ---- being an MMO.   This is the best I've seen yet.  While I do still see huge room for improvement in the future, such as multi-level rooms(floors 1, 2, 3, etc. etc.)  and the potential for adding floating/orbiting planes of game-play,  As-is this game is amazing!         I highly recommend doing the tutorial section on screeps.com more than a few times while looking over various Javascript and Typescript tutorials - and becoming as familiar with the scripting as possible before diving into the MMO world.  I started knowing nothing at all, and I've been able to establish reliable code that is able to maintain and grow!  It's not easy getting into it at first with no knowledge, but if you pace yourself.         Use the included Local Server(Private server) with the fast-tick mod, you'll be able to learn quickly and find yourself in love with learning all there is to know about Javascript, Typescript and anything else you can to improve / optimize your screeps colony!"
357,2565,"Very good game with a lot of depth and active developers, but only recommended if you have some programming experience. The game is rather slow, so if you are not currently changing your AI, you play it more as a browser game, where you check in a few times a day.I recommend writing your own AI from scratch, as it is just awesome to see the creeps get more and more ""intelligent"".It is normal to have your colony wiped out because of some bug you missed, or an aggressive neighbor you did not expect, but as in all RTS, you learn from your mistakes and start anew."
358,2564,by no means buy
359,2564,"I've been trying to motivate myself to learn to programme properly for some time (know the very basics) but i have never found a project that has kept me interested long enough.Screeps fills that memory.role :)Great fun, love tinkering with my code and watching the changes, has motivated me to complete a udemy coarse on java script so that i can improve my AI.Don't let yourself be intimidated by the thought of learning to program, the tutorial will get you up and running with the very basics of java script, all I recommend is that you familiarise yourself with the basics of object orientated languages, after that the basics are a breeze.Support for this game is available, but I'd recommend that you be willing to self help here, after all, it is a game for programmers / people with a desire to learn programming.Solid 8/10"
360,2560,"Good if you want to learn javascript in a fun way. Interesting and well excecuted concept. Great MMO and strategy aspects.But not new player friendly at all. Severely advantaging people with more time, experience and money spent in the game."
361,2560,there are very basic things that I do exactly as I learned them in the tutorial and they just don't work and I don't have a clue why
362,2560,"10/10 would smash again. I had always been interested in coding and I had dabbled in it in the past with C++ and C#. JavaScript reminds me of C# in many ways. Anyway when I bought Screeps, it wasn't long before I had a real passion for understanding the basics and building upon my limited coding knowledge. The community is very helpful and friendly and the devs are very active. If there is a bug in the server, it is fixed ASAP."
363,2559,This game is P2WProgram to win
364,2558,one of the most interesting games so far I've found on Steam. Very good for practicing JS skills.
365,2557,super duper :D
366,2557,Awesome game if you have at least some programming knowlage.
367,2556,This game needs it's lime light ! Such a shame to see a masterpeice shoved under the rug.
368,2556,"This is an extremely fun game for programmers & enthusiasts. It's a MMO RTS game where you can build empires out of Javascript code and simple APIs, what more could you want? It doesn't get stale easily, there's always something to do, something to optimize for programmers of all levels & backgrounds, and it even lets you run your own dedicated servers. It's also a great way to introduce someone to programming, as you/your friend will likely not be getting more positive feedback and gratification anywhere else.Don't mind my play record, I've played this game for quite a long time before it was released on Steam, and I heartily recommend it to everyone."
369,2555,Doesn't work. The first command of the tutorial does nothing and now I'm stuck. The UI is incredibly unresponsive.
370,2555,"if (potentialBuyer.doesNotKnowJavascript === true && potentialBuyer.unwillingToLearnJavascript === true) {    console.log('this game isnt for you, friend')}Seriously though, if you're unfamiliar with javascript and you don't want to learn it, save your money and don't buy this game. Personally, I went into this game with next to no experience in the language. I struggled immensely with simultaneously learning both the language and the game's API for the first couple of days. But after the initial hurdle, everything started falling into place rather quickly. If you want to learn a programming language, design an AI, rage, and have fun all at the same time...Screeps is the way to go."
371,2555,"This game is like crack for programmers. All of the functionality of the games API is its own and wont really benifit you when it comes to things like HTML5 DOM manipulation, but it is one of the most zen experiences ive ever had and will give you a good idea of how to at least modularize and prototype your code.  Plus you wont really need to pay for a cpu subscription for a LONG time due to the sheer fact that, if you are using over 20 cpu cycles on a single room, Your memory management/cpu useage is horrible and you need to take steps to better modularize and optimize your memory useage. With proper memory useage comes better cpu performance. 11/10 this game is pretty amazing."
372,2554,"LOL this is not for new people xD im not good at scripting at all, while playing this game and looking up tutorials I learned how to do math through Scripps which was cool,as you can see I have under 6 hours in this game but the real question is was the $15 worth it I say yes, well maybe I had help from two other friends that knew a lot more than me and played with me which made it a lot better but they kind of stops playing xD the only scripting software that I knew was Microsoft Visual Studio which I really liked the font well I guess I was just because It was black that's what I used, the scraping software with screeps isn't that good but I don't even know what I'm talking about soafter a quick tutorial I was able to easily save the scripts I made through Visual Studio into the screeps but at tutorial that they give you a pretty good if you understand what you're doing and as a new player I can see getting into scripting I did a couple tutorials on JavaScript even though this is run off of java it wasn't easy because they change things or I'm just so unexperienced I would say that this game is hella hit or miss it is technically a paid subscription but you can always play by yourself or host your own server which is pretty cool I really like that because the last thing I'd want to do is be forced to play online with people because I'm not good you do have a safe timer inside your little box so people can't instantly murder you which is cool"
373,2554,Every developer could learn a thing or two from this.
374,2554,"I had gotten this game as a way to practice programming while playing a game. The thing I didn't realize and wasn't mentioned was that you have to learn the API before you even play. It does not teach you this API in-game, you must go to the Documentation to learn it.Now I'm sorry but I don't want to have to learn a new API in my own time just to play a game, especially if its not going to teach you the basics of how to even make your little guys move. That's like being told you must read user manual to a roller coaster to understand how its built, before you're even allowed into the line to ride one.I'm sure it could be fun, but the steep learning curve that you could spend practicing ACTUAL programming, I don't feel its worth the time or money."
375,2553,fun game
376,2552,"Pure bliss, Enjoyable and gave me a serious boost in my JS coding experience and abillity This game is one of the most addictive games I've ever played.I recommand every developer to aquire this game"
377,2552,"Not for everyone, but definitely worth it for people knowing how to code or trying to learn."
378,2551,What else would programmer do than write code to play games? ;)
379,2551,Great.
380,2551,"After 2600+ hours, I can honestly say I've gotten more playtime out of this than I ever expected to get out of a $10 game.For three years, I've consistently comeback to make small adjustments, and watch my colonies grow. I've taught myself javascript through Screeps with the help of the single most helpful and knowledgeable community in the world on the official Slack channel. Always something more to learn and new ways to grow. I cannot recommend this more for people who have even the slightest interest in programming."
381,2551,Now 20 CPU for free forever 
382,2551,"Writing code for Screeps is a pain: The documentation is incomplete and I found at least one example code snippet that is not working as intended. In addition, there isn't any way to professionally debug your code - just submit and cross your fingers... In summary, I am quite disappointed with my Screeps experience."
383,2551,"> creep.writeReview(""Screeps"");Screeps is a game that plays itself! No, seriously. You write the code for your AI creeps and structures, and then they do their things!It's all about programming, so at least basic knowledge of programming languages and how to write code will get you long way. Learning programming from scratch with Screeps is going to be tough, but if you have the basics, this is a great way to deepen your knowledge in a pretty realistic environment. At least, until things go south and you have to debug that pesky error while your creeps are dying left and right! Battle coding at its best :)The game engine uses JavaScript natively, but has support for many languages that can be transpiled into either JavaScript or WebAssembly.If you ever dreamed of writing your own game AI, or just enjoy watching your ants creeps go about their daily businesses, this is a game for you!There are plenty of examples ranging from useful code snippets to fully-fledged standalone AI bots available, and if playing with/against other players is not your thing there is a standalone server provided."
384,2551,A wonderful challenge to write an AI which can compete with AI of other players.
385,2551,"You know how to program, but never tried JavaScript?This is the best tutorial you will ever find. Period.It has the ideal learning curve. The problems get harder to solve the better you are - simply because you create your own problems with your own ambitions.You start out with some very basic code from the tutorials that makes it very easy to build and maintain a base. From there on your improve your code to enable more stuff. Like harvesting energy from other rooms nearby, automatically spawn attacker creeps if enemies are attacking you, claim other rooms, etc.. All that you have to automate yourself. Then you reach a point of ""feature complete"" and continue with the next goal you set yourself.The learning curve is basically as step as you can climb at any given point. The bigger your ambitions and your already finished improvements the more complicated it is going to be to fit in another one that is implemented efficiently (limited CPU, after all).The game is amazing and I have barely ever had so much fun coding in my life. I came into this with very little knowledge of JS, but experience in several other different languages (C, C++, VB.NET, Python, Matlab (if you want to count that), and some more). But now I am pretty confident in my JS skills. By no means could I call myself a JS developer, but I do have a lot experience now and definitely got the basics down.10-15 bucks for the best JS tutorial you can find? Learning how to code JS while enjoying a very well-designed game?The answer is *yes*.-------Side note:You should probably already have some coding experience going into this. Only very basic JS knowledge is required and I only had to look a few things up."
386,2550,It's great to improve programming.
387,2549,I can't read
388,2549,"This is a really fun sandbox game for people who like to program. It's a persistent MMO RTS, so your little creeps are running around on your instructions in 'real time' 24/7. It's really a very cool concept. It's really burrowed into my brain and I find myself thinking about how to solve problems when I'm supposed to be working. Ever since I've become a professional programmer I've had a hard time coding for fun because it feels like work. This game really scratches that itch for me, like almost to a fault. It seems like it could be a good way to learn to program, but at the same time it seems like it would be pretty overwhelming if you're a true neophyte. (You can play the tutorial directly on the game's website for free as a trial. The website in general is well made and brings a lot to the table on its own.)"
389,2549,"i think the game would be much more popular is it was more accessable. I bought this game like a year ago with a basic amount of knowledge of python but after searching for help on the internet i could never even spawn a creep XD i always got an error, and also (im not sure if this is just because i have a mac and not a pc) its so stupid how you cannot copy or paste anything from/into the section where you write the code!! i accept that i am a noob, and im just saying that tjhis game wasnt at all enjoyable for me, no matter how hard i tried, so if you dont really know what youre doing with coding then dont get this game, otherwise go buy it or whatever, i dont care"
390,2549,This is amazing game for anyone who enjoys coding and wishes to improve skills!
391,2547,"The game idea is amazing.  The implimentation is also pretty good.  It does take a lot of time to learn though.  I am a professional developer and I use Javascript a lot, however interacting with the game interface isn't as easy as it looks.  I was very easily able to do the basics, but I had trouble going beyond the basis for lack of documented examples and personal time. So, I would recomend this game if you are a developer and have the time, otherwise I'd say it probably isn't for you."
392,2547,"Simply epic. The idea and the execution are both really good. And there is depth - a huge one. Not just in the coding part, but in the strategy part as well. Love the game."
393,2547,"Great game, totally recommend it for anyone interested in programming."
394,2547,"Lots of fun!!! It uses an actual programming languadge, not sudo code."
395,2546,I love this game !It must be noted that at least basic level of programming is needed to really appreciate the game.
396,2546,"Screeps is a complex sandbox with clear defined rules that has no ""ulitmate"" answer.It is just fun to watch your little screeps doing their work.( If you managed to squash your bugs xD )But beaware that this ""game"" is a round based (called ticks) simulation and the official server cluster takes it time to process all information. Nothing fast paced, look at private servers for that :-)That is the perk the steam version brings, oh and lifetime 20 CPU on the official server cluster.The documentation is A- since some stuff is not obvious but very usable.I whole heartly recomend this game if you like optimization challenges and are fond of JavaScript,but don't buy it if you intend to learn scripting with it.For that i.e. codersgame.com is far better suited with its small puzzels.Once you have a feeling for the programming language dive in ;-D"
397,2546,it  is quite the experince!
398,2546,If you like programming or want to learn this is a great game. It doesnt have much in the forms of teaching JS but it gives an incentive to learn. Very fun too. Watching your code come to life and actually perform is rewarding.
399,2546,"I really like this game, although I think certain areas could be improved.What I like: Easy to get started, fairly easy to get a basic colony going. Good documentation Fun way to compete againts friends or colleages based on programming skill. Lifetime acces through steam is a great way to play the game on and off.What I think can be improved: The easthetics representing game state better might make the game more rewarding.For instance, it would be great if the Creeps could scale according to the amount of work units they have. I think that would add some more visual feedback to what you are producing with your ai, without having to inspect Creeps to see what body has been Created. The default pathfinder is not that great. It will take into account the current positions of other screeps while being on the other side of the map, this makes for a lot of unnecessary route changes. Documentation could be inlined in the editor for quick reference lookup/ code copletion. Worlds are somewhat repetitive because of the way the ""shards"" have been created. I think there is alot that could be done by creating variable sized rectangles or perhaps even other shapes."
400,2546,A truly unique game: if only there were more games based on programming such as this this!
401,2546,"Wow. Just wow. This game has consumed my time. My hours are skewed becuase I have spent time on the web version.The game is very niche, that is undeniable. Its a programming game, and expects that you have some background knowledge. I only knew basic/intermediate level phython/java before buying Screeps but that is enough of a backbone for you to be able to understand how to play.If you like to program, it's for you. Otherwise, most likely not."
402,2546,"The game itself is a concept I love, coding AI to do things for you. I've been wanting a game like this for years, and I had a blast spending 200 hours on it.Incidentally, 200 hours of playtime is about how long it took for my beginner shields to go down. They block off a region and the newbies get to fight it out (unless an experienced player is restarting, in which case all the newbies die very quickly). As soon as the shields went down the friendly neighbourhood super power wiped us all out. We even had a little alliance and prep plans to defend, but better experience/code base/resources meant we didn't last long.The game itself is awesome, but if you play just be aware you could easily be a sheep in the wolf's maw without realizing it. Be prepared for hardship."
403,2545,"Extremely good game if you like to program. It's very satisfying to watch the creeps going about their business, especially when that business is something that you spent hours coding."
404,2544,this is  stupid theres no autocomplete so u have to pull words out of ur ass
405,2544,"Pretty fun so far. I learned java in high school. Javascript isn't the same but it's similar. I had no javascript experience before this game and caught on quit quickly. I have alot to learn still but had enough to make my creeps gather, attack, defend, do some if this than that stuff in respect to if resources were full or empty and switching roles.What I like about this game is it is really like no other in being able to upgrade and reflect skill.. In other games you have to grind. In this game you grind by sitting at the desk with coffee planning how you will write the code. If you have more skill truly you will progress faster. This isn't a matter of game time alone but real brain power. I don't recommend if you have never seen computer code before. If you have something similar then why not. It teaches a life skill and you have fun."
406,2543,"Honestly pretty well-fleshed out and enjoyable, but one thing you need to know before starting out is that you will need to be exceptionally skilled at optimization to get to the later stages. Heavy usage of caching and other skilled techniques will be a must. You have a limited amount of CPU you can use per tick to command your entire army with. The game quickly goes from learning the ropes as a beginner to balancing your CPU usage so you can keep playing the game. You think, ""hey, this game looks great! I can make a massive army and have huge bases that are 100% automated!"" But unfortunately this game is a bit more constraining than you'd think. Of course, if you run a private server then you will have a far greater CPU budget.The game has incredible levels of depth and is very well-rounded, with incredibly useful documentation to rely on. Very enjoyable for most people with an interest in JavaScript and similar languages. Definitely not a good pick for people not interested in programming.The CPU balancing act is certainly not my cup of tea, but I can see how people enjoy it."
407,2542,edit:problems for performance seem to be addressed. UI is much cleaner as well.
408,2542,"This game is great! I'm playing on a private server with a few of my collegues and it is a log of fun.A bit of JS knowledge is required but the game motivates to dig further into JS.9/10, performance of the client could be better"
409,2541,I <3 programming
410,2540,"This game is unlike any other -- it's a MMO programming competition. You get to passively develop your 'empire' and improve your programming skills while you're at it. Javascript, for example. Or algorithms. It's gamified programming education. So, if you're interested in learning to program (you do need to know some programming basics to be able to do anything), it's a good way to practice."
411,2540,I like memes
412,2539,"The game runs extremely poorly on MAC (2015 Macbook Pro, Core i7 16Gb of RAM).The game becomes slower and slower as you play. After 5-15 minutes it becomes extremely choppy and almost unplayable. CPU usage maxes out and notebook heats up to extreme. I would not strain a notebook like this. Requested a refund, even though game itself is nice (i played through all tutorials).FYI tried all explained here too:https://steamcommunity.com/app/464350/discussions/0/133262487501230269/?ctp=2"
413,2539,"This client is so incredibly slow that I can't believe it. It does almost nothing, just renderes a little bit of text and a few images that move every few seconds and it lags. Incredible. Factorio runs more than 10 times faster and smoother while doing MORE WORK. I really like the idea behind this game but the execution is just way too bad. Instead of being able to enjoy the game, I get frustrated by how terribly it runs.EDIT: The game often leaves the Steam client thinking it's still running when it's not and forces me to force quit Steam. Recetly it also started opening as a white window and only starts to display the actual menu after I resize the window."
414,2538,Really fun and challenging
415,2537,"This game introduces a fun way to get into programing, if you arnt interested in learning how to code i wouldnt recomend it. However if you have an interest in learning how to code in a fun environment, this is the game for you. Or, if you are already an experienced programer this is equally the game for you, go fight the wars that take place 24/7."
416,2537,"Amazing Game, where you program your colony to success. I have gotten this game only a week ago, and already have 40 hours on it. It does reqiure some basic programming skills, but taking a one week course on javascript will be enogh."
417,2536,"My review is mostly negative, because of:1. Pricing (https://steamcommunity.com/app/464350/discussions/0/351659808492806689/)2. No isolation between veterans and newbies (https://steamcommunity.com/app/464350/discussions/0/1745594817445565984/).I hope to change it someday. Yes, if you don't want to pay for the offline script execution as much as if you play some AAA MMORPG by the greatest brands.Funny, if you want it look more like a game, with leveled servers for players of different skills, making it more interesting and fairly competing.Leaving a vote lifts the review up, so it's more likely to see such changes in future."
418,2534,"Overall I'm very happy with screeps. My javascript skills have gone through the roof playing this game, as has my general skills as a programmer. The game is fun and I always have a new challenge whenever I log on, in how I want to improve my code. If you want some productive gaming where you gain useful skills, this is it."
419,2534,"With a game such as this, its kinda hard to rate the traditional way, so the average rating will probably be a bit, odd. However, it seems about the most accurate if you discount my personal experience. I'd say just barely 6 if I calculate everything except my personal experience.If you skip reading my review, just know that this game is for programmers only, those that can do javascript.Averaged Rating: 6/10Graphics: 2/10Gameplay: 8/10Replay Value: 8/10AI: 9/10Learning Difficulty: 3/10----------------------------------------------Personal Rating: 3/10Personal: -3 Community treatment.Sound, Storyline, and Options were removed from the list.Game has no sound at all, a disappointment for me but its not calculated in the average rating, however it is another reason for personal rating being lower.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ReviewOverall, my experience with Screeps wasn't a very pleasant one.The game its self is ok, to a point.The slack community is full of those types that jealously defend their game to the death if you even say one bad thing about it.Before I bought the game, they claimed to me the game would teach me javascript, which lead to me deciding, fine, lets get it, it'll help me learn. No, it does not, they lied to get me to buy it. It helps you gain better skills if you're already an intermediate javascript coder, but if you're not even at the beginner stage yet, you're SOL because you can't learn anything here.The official servers have a 3 second tick length sometimes worse, the average appears to be 3.5 seconds rounded to the nearest .5, and during some hardware issues it has hit 11 seconds per tick. If you play on your own private server you can set the tick time yourself, however Windows private servers are highly inefficient, and have no optimizations that lead to the game dying after several hours regardless of the hardware power you have.The game needs several optimizations and has an issue with Novice Zones so beginner players will be wiped when they try to use the safe areas of the game. I've seen it first hand as one player wiped the entire Novice Zone I started in for my very first time.Based on my personal experience, I'd have to rate this game 3 out of 10 stars.The game its self, ignoring the community problems, its great for teaching optimization of code within limits of CPU usage and memory.Great for advanced coders for sure. In this aspect, 6 out of 10 stars. Has potential for more.Suggested FixesThe steam client confuses people into thinking they have to join the global servers immediately and consume their 30 days of free subscription time, and you can't access simulation mode without entering a server global or otherwise firt. The one button interface is confusing to new people, and ends up wasting their free 30 day subscription with steam client purchase before they're ready to use it. The devs have not fixed this and when I suggested a fix in the Slack, I got scoffed at. Because review limits, I can't go into huge detail so I'll just provide some helpful suggestion URLs. Below is links to change the UI for better clarification, suggestion to let us delete messages, and novice time to tick time suggestion. I have more on the forums but these are relevant.https://screeps.com/forum/topic/2297/change-the-main-screen-ui-stop-the-confusionhttps://screeps.com/forum/topic/2299/account-messages-delete-archivehttps://screeps.com/forum/topic/2292/novice-spawn-counter-ticks-not-timeTicksI do not blame the devs for the tick time of the official servers, its only natural when you have too many people on one server. It could probably be solved by opening multiple small servers however, with a player limit per server. Special subscription servers for subscribers only, special free servers where you're maxed at 10ms even if you subscribe. Lots of methods to help alleviate this issue.Private ServersYou can always host your own private server if you want fair or better tick times, but if you're on Windows you can't get the things you need to optimize it. It comes un-optimized. After 6 hours of running a private server, it was using 150% of my CPU power running my system hot, lagging at about 5 seconds per tick. I reboot the server its self without even restarting the game client, and the CPU usage across my 4 cores 8 threads dropped to 25% and tick time was 1 second per tick again, everything was running super smooth, for another hour or two before it started maxing out again.Bot UsersSome users don't even know how to code, they just download someone's bot from the internet and use that. Unfortunately, there's no code or intervention system to put a stop to this. These users easily wipe novice areas as a result and prevent new players from learning the game.Client LagAnother area that needs optimization is the client starts to bog down and lag after a while. Some sort of garbage collection issue in the graphics renderer, possibly. After a while your client whether steam or browser (browser is worse) will begin to lag. Click the gear icon and act as if you're about to change graphics options, then click apply and that'll reload all graphics and fix the lag for a while.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I encourage people to reply with their thoughts. I think my contributions to the forums both official and steam, will speak for themselves."
420,2534,"Is a really neat project. But at the end of the day, what I wanted to do with it the game probably won't support. The game needs some sort of official code bundler that can reliably generate code using commonly available module formats (UMD, common js, ES6, etc). Without such a tool, anyone who wants to write code that uses external modules is at the mercy of third party bundling tools that may or may not work. Sadly, my experience spending a couple of days with the Typescript bundler turned up a variety of problems with simple modules and a dearth of expertise among the community on why the tools inexplicably don't work. My advice is to avoid the game until better tooling is available, either from the community or from the developers. That said, if you can tolerate the somewhat limited coding environment, I'm sure you'd like it. Until I can somehow surmount the issues I'm seeing, is a thumbs down for me. That said, I'll continue to tinker with it and update this review as needed."
421,2533,"This game is neat! I'm still new at it (hours listed are mostly from leaving it on even when not at my computer) but it looks promising. In too many games, it's easy to complain about the AI for any CPU characters/objects, but in screeps that AI is up to you! If you see problematic behavior, you have to think of a way to correct it. The game is about figuring out how to get your base and creeps to make good decisions.As others have said, this IS A PROGRAMMING GAME so there's no slick UI with boxes to select for pre-programmed behavior options. You aren't building AI from parts; you are building it from scratch. You have to look at the documentation and code up all the logic in the IDE of your choice. The game has a built in IDE which works fine, so there's no need to go digging for additional software just to play."
422,2532,"This game is very different from everything out right now, not only because it requires a subscription per month to keep your game running but also because it allows you to fully test your skills at programming and compete with others playing the game. The game is based around territories that you control, while programming your bots to defend your space while harvesting resources and eventually conquering other territories. All of this happens while you are away from the game if your code is good enough. If you need help in the game there are plenty of guides out on Youtube and other platforms. Overall it's a really cool game if you know what you are doing and enjoy the challenge of programming."
423,2532,"Awesome game. But seriously, only buy it if you're into or seriously want to get into programming.I'm 80 hours in and haven't needed the subscription yet, so well worth it even if you just burn out in the first 30 days."
424,2532,"Requires a tiny bit of knowledge about programming, but its easy enough to ""fake it"" until things start to make sense."
425,2532,Love this game. You have to be interested in coding to really get into it but theres good tutorials for beginners. As someone who had coding experience already its definately a fun kind of challenge.
426,2531,"Don't be fooled.  This game is not finished.  It is not intended to teach you how to program in Javascript.  If you want a singleplayer experience you have to create your own server because the ""simulator"" has some kind of memory issue and after a couple minutes will slow to the speed of a mastodon stuck in a tarpit which is in turn stuck in a stasis field and is also very cold.THAT BEING SAID this game helped me learn Javascript (even though it's not intended to) and is fantastically fun in its current state and who needs the simulator anyway?  Even if this game didn't singlehandedly birth the strategy programming genre (which it totally just did just now) it would still be a laudably, persistently, educationally fun way to spend a few bucks and some time.  Does that justify a $9/month paywall?  Meh, probably it does, sure."
427,2531,Extremly fun game for those who want to sharpen their javascript (or any other compiled language via WebAssembly) skills.Basic programming or JavaScript knowledge is recommended but for the persistent learner a great fun way to learn scripting from scratch.Absolutely recommended for those who love scripting and want to see their code in action instantly.
428,2531,"Eat, Screep, Rage, Repeat.This is my life and it is ending one tick at a time."
429,2531,"I was quite excited to buy this as I wanted to improve my JavaScript skills, but was really disappointed to see a mandatory subscription fee, on top of a somewhat outdated interface that I was greeted with in the beginning.Admittedly, my fault for not understanding the CPU subscription was basically a typical MMO sub fee, but I don't intend on paying a sub fee for something that could be an excellent free service instead considering the fact that an actual purchase is required as well.Other disappointments included somewhat outdated UI, lack of music or sound and overall look of the game in its current state.I might revisit this later just to see if something major has been improved, but it's not worth the money I think, especialy since you could hypothetically use programming to play Starcraft for free and use a Python library to write similar, more advanced scripts absolutely free of charge."
430,2531,"I didnt want to start playing it when i bought it during a sale; and being a subcription based game, i was worried about that.  I read a dev post saying  that the subcription doesnt start untill you start playing on the offical servers.  Great. Launched the game, expected to see a main menu with a single player/tutorial/server browser options. A popup asked me to enter my name; and that made an account, and started ticking down my one month.  Now i'm a bit too salty to even try it."
431,2531,Great game!
432,2530,"This game, while not what I would call a traditional ""game"" is an experience aspiring programmers can share with each other as they encounter glitches in their first Operating Systems.  Crashes encountered often leave bots stranded in the wasteland that is the hosted server.  While there are a few dozen folks playing at any given time, if you have not found and adapted an existing framework you will be consumed as soon as your safety timer is up."
433,2530,really fun and i only know basic programming!
434,2529,"A coding mmo played by thousands in a cuthrout 24/7 world testing your coding ability, planning, and code structure to construct a far reaching presence and army on any given shard; must I say more? My only regret is that I wish I knew more javascript. Though the subscription model is rather offputting it is still immensly fun to play on the non-subscription model. Can be very annoying though when players just use open-source code for their armies to simply steamroll others."
435,2528,"Even though I have only been playing for a week, I have had a blast with this game. I would warn that the game is really a programming competition, and most of the 'gameplay' is algorithm development / improvement (and bugfixing). That being said, if you know any C-based programming language, you should be fine. I mostly use C++ and python, but the JS API is simple enough that you should be able to use it if you understand variables and functions.And also there is a cpu subscription that you have to buy if you want more than 10ms of run-time in the full MMO environment. This is understandable: devs need to eat, and server time is not free. The game really is quite an impressive feat imo, and it looks like the devs are actively trying to add some new features (power creeps) to make the game's world more rich.This game is time consuming, but I think it is much more fun and rewarding than other MMO/RTS games which try to lock you out of automation and make you do everything manually. With this game, you know you are in a real competition. You know that your performance is based on your ability to envision and build a better, more robust system rather than your ability to memorize macros or click a trigger button really fast.My experience so far:After completing the tutorial, the first few hours of playing the game are pretty slow because you are just trying to understand the API, how to control units, etc. You eventually adapt the tutorial AI to a new system which you envision, do some cleaning / optimization stuff, and build your own self-sustaining colony.Once the basics are out of the way, you need to focus on defense. The game automatically sends enemies to attack you after you have done enough stuff in the room. At that point, your colony is destroyed and you need to write code to automatically rebuild and maintain some warriors or a tower for defense.After you have the basics of defense and colony building, you need to figure out how to expand, gather more resources, and improve fortifications. That's where I am about a week in. I might update this when I am further along in my journey."
436,2528,That game is a really good way to increase global programming skills. Since we don't often have opportunities to develop interesting stuff for personal purpose (lack of idea or creativity) it gives a good opportunity to program something interesting and which will push you to always upgrade your code to defend or fight other players. The only bad point (which obviously is no longer that bad since the introduction of shards) is the slow tick rate. I definitely recommend that game to whoever is looking to learn or increase his programming skills
437,2528,"good lord this is a best game that ever existedP.S.if you dont like the game/can not write code, then you are a filthy pleb that is a shame to human race"
438,2528,it's a gameand it teaches you to code.... while killing hundreds innocent creeps XDCOOLgame + AI coding = GREAT stuff
439,2527,"This is by far the best programming based game I have ever played. The documentation is fantastic and there are countless options available to play how you want to (official server, private server, mods, etc). It's also been a very education experience  as well - I started at ""kinda familiar"" with javascript to much more than that, and even ventured into typescript. Oh, and the community is very helpful. The subscription (which is optional, and intended for serious players on the official server) is quite reasonable, especially considering the amount of resources it must take to run everyone's unique scripts on the server."
440,2527,"I would say it is nothing for the impatient, but if you like to script and to optimize things in general you will have fun!I hope we will see a lot more in the future, because what we already have is really nice :) Efforts in such an area should really be supported!"
441,2527,really great game if you like to program javascript!!!highly addictive and very flexable api!
442,2527,"Not much to say. If you want to practice Javascript or coding in general, Screeps is a great gain that offers so much learning experience and hours of fun. Easy to learn and hard to master. 10/10"
443,2527,First of programming games I really love. Game enter block is low but Screeps offer a lot of advanced mechanics which are hard to master also.
444,2526,"This simply is the most addicting game ever made - if you don't mind programming every aspect of your RTS!Most puzzle games are rather boring not because they're not challenging, but because there's no accomplishment or goals in them. You play them until you are bored. This game is one giant puzzle you can solve any way you want. But unlike puzzle games, every small step you achieve feels like a great accomplishment, whether you improve your economy, spawn another colony, evade the notorious source keepers or wipe your first (newbie) base.It is more a hobby than a game, because you actually create something, like a model train or a garden, just for nerds who like to program. It is minecraft for programmers or people who like to program (i'm not a programmer in my day job though it has been a hobby when I was a child). Your codebase is what matters not your base. You see your bases grow with your codebase. It doesn't matter if your base gets wiped because it allows you to improve your codebase and respawn/restart with better code. I've respawned three times simply because my first two starting positions didn't allow me to expand well.Yesterday a new colony got wiped away by my new neighbour. He must not have liked the close presence (and expansive road building network logic). There literally was nothing I could do - because I lacked any serious defense or attack logic I only had economic logic.Time for revenge - adding the required attack logic made it possible to take revenge on the attacker base and restart my colony. And kill any other newbies that happen to be close to me... :D. Very cool game that I hope will give me and other who like this kind of challenge plenty more fun!The game does have a monthly cost, but if viewed as a hobby, like gardening, or socker, or chess, it is really cheap and money well spent. It is cheaper then most other hobbies. The chess club also costs money for the facilities, as does this game for the hosting.The only gripe I have is that the client (chrome or steam client) is really slow and needs a modern machine with fast CPU. It runs too slow on my weaker machines/chromebook.BTW I don't play the game through steam. I've had it for about 3 weeks and have put more hours in it then I can count. The game can be played through google chrome perfectly and you should use visual studio code (or similar) to push your code."
445,2526,"So I grabbed this game on a whim a while back, I think it was on sale.  Anyway I promptly forgot about it.  Stumbled across it a few days ago.  Apparently I set it up but got side-tracked and so the 30 day sub is gone, but no matter.  This game is very, very cool.  I am instantly addicted.  Fair warning: If you don't know Javascript, learn it.  You absolutely can't do anything unless you know how to work with Javascript.  That being said, I had almost zero Javascript knowledge 5 days ago.  I mean I've done several ""Learn Javascript For Free"" online classes, but nothing really stuck.  That is no longer the case.  Even though they say it right out, ""This is not for learning Javascript"" I'm afraid I have to disagree.  Think of it like full immersion learning.  Like if you were suddenly dropped in a foreign country and you don't speak the language.  If you want to interact with people, well you learn quick.     Anyway, about the game ... honestly it doesn't have a lot going for it, besides the way it is played.  I mean the graphics are pretty plain-jane, the action is nada, at least so far for me.  Although I've been told once you leave the protected noob area that things can heat up, I will have to wait and see.     So would I recommend this game?  Yes and No.  If you are a skilled javascript coder, interested in AI and automation or you just want to dive in and sink or swim, then this game is for you, yes I would recommend.  BUT, if you are looking for some action, a good story or knock-your-socks off graphics ... keep looking as you will hate this game.  It is hard, it is frustrating, it will make you curse all the gods of syntax when a missed semicolon brings the whole operation to a screeching halt and you spend THREE AND A HALF HOURS trying to debug something that you coded in 20 minutes and ran great right up until you went to the bathroom ...      Still, I am enjoying myself, learning as I go, cursing every step of the way.  Final thought, check out the free live demo over at screeps.com and decide for yourself.  Enjoy!"
446,2525,"I recommend for all who likes to write codes, and see if something working on its own.I spent so much time creating the economics, logistics and it was pure fun.Let's Code"
447,2525,"Amazing practice for Javascript programmers.  Addictive and satisfying RTS gameplay.Your skills and guile, along with reducing memory and CPU usage, are the real enemies in screeps.Beware open source bots."
448,2525,"I program for a living.  I hate using JavaScript.  I love this game.  This is actually pretty good training for programmers.  You can get your colony going with simple activities using simple scripts, but then you start to see where you could iterate to improve edge cases.  Your code grows dynamically forcing you to refactor.  Then you learn how embrace change and write code that is more easily refactorable which makes you a better developer.  You also will eventually need to respect the processing limits of the game so you start to work in optimizations which makes you a better developer.  Some of the most fun I've had with this game was writing a module to allow my AI to pick out areas to place defense walls that would be effective."
449,2524,That's one of the coolest game I've ever played.Seeing my codealive is a top of awesomness.
450,2523,"Quite a fun (not so)-little game. The actual fun comes from writing your code and watching your creeps follow your command, usually to their demise to begin with."
451,2523,One of its kind so not much to compare with. Community is very helpful though.
452,2522,"Great game where you end up building your own complexity into it.  You'll never quite feel satisfied with what you've written and there's always room for optimization/new strategies, highly recommend if you enjoy optimization and solving open-ended problems."
453,2522,Such a great game. Its so much fun to automate all these processes in our base and gather resources. I wish more games like this existed. The only downside is that 15 bucks a month is pretty steep.
454,2521,If you like a real strategic game with lots of features you will love it. But it need time till you understand it !!
455,2521,10/10
456,2520,Very fun and challengingI recommend it if you know how to write in java
457,2520,"I have only just started playing this game but so far I am in love with it! I don't really know what to say other than if you like solving problems in code and figuring out most efficient routes then this game is for you.Things I would improve/change: 1. The api referance doesn't seem to include all of the available objects. I'm not sure if it was their intention, but it seems like I need to play around quite a bit with the different prototypes/object to figure out exactly whats going on.2. When you log out an object I would love if it was like a browser inspector where you can click to expand the object and see what is inside.3. If the game ticks were less than 5 seconds... haha"
458,2517,"If you are a programmer that likes RTS then this could be one of the most awesome games you will ever play.To enjoy the game you should also;  Join their Slack channel, its where the community is and they are very helpful Be prepaired that your code will take time to become good Don't download a bot from the web unless you want to give other players a reason to kick you back to the spawn screen And last, BE READY TO DIE AND RESPAWN. Respawn and starting over isn't bad, you will still have your code that you developed so just respawn & keep developing."
459,2517,"Another warfest where the pinnacle of achievement is building weapons of mass destruction, cannot recommend anyone to waste time on and corrupt society by warring ""for fun"". By human standards though, the game is good, sadly. If only there was something constructive to build through collaborative effort..."
460,2517,You can use WebAssembly.
461,2516,"This game is amazing for so many purposes.  Whether it's a fun way to pick up Javascript or looking for a passive non-pay-to-win game to occupy time, this game is ideal."
462,2515,"I can't say much beyond what's been said before, but if you have any programming knowledge especially Javascript, try out this game!"
463,2514,Come home from my programming job to play a programming game...
464,2514,"I get what they're going for here, but it doesn't work as a game. At any moment, you're either in a situation where your code does cover everything going on, and you do nothing, or your code DOESN'T work for what's going on, your base wipes while you're fixing it, then you wait another 4 days for your base to build back up and try again. Even that would be acceptible if I could just play it casually on-and-off over a long time, but with a steep monthly fee for a game with so little actual content being developed for it I can't afford to have that patience.Oh, and don't let the trailer fool you, on the live servers every single tick of movement takes at least 4 seconds. You'll ""play"" for hours and one thing will happen, maybe."
465,2514,"Very fun, but dont expect it to be easy, especally if you dont have much time to play it."
466,2514,An awesome and addicting opportunity to test code solutions in an unusual and complex environment!
467,2513,"I am having so much fun playing this game. Programming games are more difficult to find thanmost other styles, and the quality and thought put into the actual gameplay shows the developers are both good programmers AND love games."
468,2513,Fun game once you get beyond the learning curve. Customer service needs improvement but it is possible to get a resolution. Even after 2 months of hardcore playing (played time is not accurate since you can play in a browser) I still haven't tackled everything the game has to offer. The community is very helpful and active.
469,2513,@devs: You need to review your coding standards... Douglas Crockford has some nice pointers on this.
470,2513,This game is challenging and rewarding.  If you are looking to start learning to code or improve your coding skills then this is for you.  If you want an easy game without challenging your brain then stay far away from this.  It is not for the weak.
471,2512,"VERY cool intro to typescript and pretty fun as you start to see what's possible. If you want to simulate your own sprawling kingdom full of subjects that obey your whims, then see how their fate pans out, this is for you. Very flexible and the intro to typescript programming is just a bonus. Highly recommended and I've seen nothing like it yet :)If you're considering writing your own offline-character scripts for stunning new titles like Chronicles of Elyria, this one has ""buy me"" all over it."
472,2512,"I had died 2 times, i am not even a noob.But this game is really good way to learn programming.. If you cant write code you will die without even see any enemy.The comunity seems to be big, and wery friendly."
473,2511,"12$ is to much to pay for a monthly subsciption for this game to work as intended. You are actively crippled vs other players unless you maintain your 12$ subscription, and to be frank, your first month you barely need the ""Free 30 days"". Its basically when they expire that it becomes relevant. Lots of games give alot more, for alot less in terms of your subscription cost.Strongly recommend you find a free game that is similar, or maybe one day they will lower the subscription cost to something resonable."
474,2511,awesome game for front end / java scrip developers
475,2511,"This is one of the most addicting games I have ever played. If you like programming and want to challenge yourself this is a must buy. Its really cool to watch your code come to life, which is something I felt was missing from programming in school. The sky is the limit as far as complexity, although you dont necessarily need the most complex code to play. You will feel fully invested in the outcome of your code."
476,2511,Awesome game concept. So many ways of spending your time :)
477,2510,very fun game
478,2510,"Simply can't get enough of this game. You need to love coding for sure, but beyond that there are many reasons this game may appeal to you. Try to fine-tune things as much as you can, only to find there is more to improve, and it is addictive as all hell. Watching the results of your efforts is extremely gratifying, even when they are not entirely successful.Get this game!"
479,2509,"The interface is frequently unresponsive. It's not my system or network; cpu, memory, and gpu load are all low. The UI just hangs all the time, particulary when you tab away for a while and back (it's not a fullscreen app, just a window), which is all the time if you use your own code editor. Same behavior with a private server on my local network. Neither the server nor my desktop are under load. Also, I'm using nvidia hardware accelleration and sometimes it just turns itself off, saying hw accel is ""unavailable"", until I completley close and restart the game. The game just isn't playable."
480,2508,My hours in Steam don't reflect how much I've played this game. I probably have about 15 hours in it so far and I'm absolutely loving it! This game is the game I've been looking for for a long time. It's a moba rts where you write code to control your units called creeps. The sky is the limit with the code you can write for this game. Someone could spend years perfecting an ai for this game. Great way to learn JavaScript (you can also write code in other languages but js is supported natively) and force yourself to write good code because you're the one maintaing it! 10/10 would recommend
481,2507,"if you're a coder, get this game"
482,2506,"If you like programming and RTS games, this is the game for you"
483,2506,"When i first got the game i left it for a while after just touching it briefly because i didn't feel like learning JS at the time. However i decided yesterday to try the game out and i'm glad that i did, even with the small time i have played i can say that the game is well developed and the game is rather addictive because as soon as you learn a few basics in JS and the game API then you can really let your imagination wonder but you have to conier your CPU which is an intresting mechanic. To finish on the topic of the CPU mechanic i personally think you should be able to alter the CPU amount on a private/singleplayer server (but that's just my personal opinion).Thank you for an awesome game!"
484,2506,if you know programming and you like games that dont take too much of your time this is the game for you... otherwise probably not...
485,2505,"I'm really loving this game.  I've always wanted to build a great AI and compete against other AIs in a RTS.  And this is MMORTS, which is better that I could have hoped for."
486,2505,"i wrote a comprehensive review and it got erased, so I'm just going to leave this here anyways. downvote if you want. or don't.basically this game is just a mess of paywalls ($8/month to have any chance on the official servers, otherwise you're just buying the client and offline mode), terrible performance, very buggy and confusing, and extremely slow, boring and redundant gameplay. great concept but atrociously executed. also with the fact that screeps incorporates JS, and with such freedom to use it for what we want (even possibly unrelated to the actual game), I'd be a little concerned about someone finding a way to abuse that.stay away, wait until something better comes along."
487,2505,"Note: My low hours comes from the time I spent designing code on the website simulation which I sadly havent found in game,A really fun game where just about anything is possible, and there are infinite ways to do so. Harvesters for example, do you go with multipurpose workers who mine and carry like traditional RTS harvesters or stationary harvesters who leave carrying to other worksers? This is just an example of one of the decisions you can make but you can choose how you want to run your won code. Since there are infinite possibilities for a given situation you can do things in any way. Although there are countless ways to do different tasks, some code is objectively better than others, this creates different levels of play and ultimately introduces competetion, this does not make the game any less fun however as you can easily improve your code based on past mistakes.For those who do not want to do a pvp experience, and would rather an empty sandbox or PVE I would open a private server, here you can customize the game to your every desire, you can add or disable bots that are added by the game, adjust tickrate, or even tweak any in game variables like creep lifetime if you know how.The only bad thing I can think of is that if you do not know how to code javascript your for all intents and purposes screwed, this does not mean you cannot play the game however I cannot reccomend playing in multiplayer until you understand at least some coding basics about coding and have developed colony scripts. Until then you basicly are dead in the water PVP wise and should stick solely to the simulations and private servers. If your willing to learn to code however I can definately reccomend this game to you and it is great for learning to optimize and upgrade your code.I would like to emphasize something from my last game, THIS IS NOT A TUTORIAL, if you come here expecting one other than a typical walkthrough that tells you what to do you will likely be disappointed but that is because you simply need to learn how to code elsewhere at first. Once you have done that, definately come here.My biggest complaint is that the in game code editor makes debugging a slight form of hell, I would love it if it highlighted the point of any contention in red or at least the error message spit out something that was more specific, and easier to read and understand. As of now it does not, it only gives you a generic javascript error that makes it confusing to understand. Another point of contention is the autocomplete is very buggy, it decides when it wants to work and generally doesnt work at all, this makes guessing some of the code you can use and reference tricky unless you know what to look for. Often you cannot autocomplete code in lines and as of such have to make a fake copy out of a code statement in order to try to coax the autocomplete to work. Although these points can be nullified by the game's support for an external code editor, it does not make the issue any less prevelant in game. Overall this game quickly became one of my favorite games for coding practice, here it can teach you debugging, optimizing, and even upgrading your code. Once youve set up your initial code you can move from the initial stage of developement and initial debugging into a live test which will highlight any issues and exploits that your code preasents to others. In this game your failiures will make you sucessful, and that is something to keep in mind. Great job on this game."
488,2504,Nice for keeping up with once own programming skills. Quite addictive... Love it!
489,2504,"This is an amazing game that lets you create whatever sort of army you want in your code to explit the bugs of all your enemeis. it has a slight pay to win feature of buying a cpu subscription(meaning you get more miliseconds of code excecution before your code is terminated), but thats to keep the servers running honestly. Very fun even on the minimum cpu that you get with the game"
490,2504,Programming without the soul crushing reality of business applications.
491,2503,"I had been whishing for a game that is'n about playing it, but about programming bots to play it for you. So I was really excited when I stumbled upon Screeps. The concept is great, but the execution is unfortunatly very poor. My 2015 macbook nearly melts when starting the web client  (latest chrome), and even my proper desktop with dedicated GPU can't give me 60fps when running a local server with a tick duration of <100ms. This is ridiculous as there are maybe 10 creeps to simulate. If I compare the performance to e.g. factorio, which simulates about a million times more objects smoothly, this is really disappointing.  Further points: the built in console is really rubbish compared to a modern Firefox/Chrome development console. Commands only seem to run at server ticks (5-10 seconds when online), very poor object printing (no expansion of nested objects).  So even though the concept is great, the performance of both the server and client code is extremely poor and thus I can only recommend if you are not easily put off by sluggish performance.EDIT:Thanks for your reply.@1 The code I tested with was with was based on the tutorial, so nothing too crazy going on. And also, this does not explain why I sometimes have very low framerates on my desktop.@2 Too bad, as I really like a console/REPL for interactively exploring the game @3 Yes, those numbers seem very high. I think 1s would be better"
492,2503,"Hell of a lot of fun. Had trouble when getting started because they were having issues with their tutorial page. However, I found some great YouTube videos and got going. Now things are working well and I'm having more fun than I've ever had writing code."
493,2503,Great game. I have seen some people complain that it doesn't teach you to program but if you take some time to do some google work and complete the tutorial you will have your little creeps moving about in no time. Then just work out what you want to improve on in your creeps and slowly build them up with more code. I should also note that i started a private server straight away and am building my scripts up before I go to the main servers. It has been heaps of fun so far i just need to find the time to sleep :P
494,2503,"You want depth? You want strategy? You want unexpected token errors 73 lines down in your harvester code? Then this is the game for you. This game is both educational and engrossing if you're the type of person that enjoys combat programming and ultra-high skill cap RTS gameplay at a snail's pace.If you're not that type of person, then don't buy it.Running someone else's code is boring, and the game's glacial pace will put you to sleep if you're not using all that downtime to improve your code. The meat of the gameplay is literally just coding the logic that your creeps will follow, and the ""game"" on-screen where your colony grows and fights other colonies just serves to give you concrete objectives and goals to reach for as you code.Once you're done coding and you feel satisfied with what your colony can do, then the game runs on autopilot. The goal of this game is to automate everything your colony does so that you don't have to play it anymore. That might sound bizarre, but the process of building up your codebase is immensely satisfying for a certain type of person who enjoys building complex systems. If you are that kind of person, or even if you suspect that you could be that kind of person, then this game is amazing."
495,2503,The game asked me to write a review so here it is ! If you don't like this you shouldn't treat me like a Candy Crush player.
496,2503,Screeps... Why use 75% Gpu power? My room is an oven...
497,2503,"Awesome, frustratingly awesome."
498,2503,Be very careful if you tried this Game on the Website (logged in via Steam account) and then decide to buy it on Steam afterwards. It just deleted all of my Scripts and I can't select my Branches any more! Every Script I wrote is gone from the Website and the installed Game client.
499,2503,this  is addicting... there is always something to improve
500,2503,"My day job involves a lot of Javascript, but I still enjoy digging into this game and figuring things out. The only minor thing is that ES6 isn't fully supported (from what I can tell, at least), which makes it slightly tricky to figure out what I can get away with. Overall, fun game, good learning experience if you're newer to Javascript, and a nice challenge if you're already proficient with it."
501,2502,best javascript game
502,2502,"I enjoy screeps immensely. I enjoy coding and the game provides interesting problems to solve. There is definitely a PvP element to the game, but I prefer the a more passive play style (sim-creeps). If that's your thing as well you'll need to pick an out of the way corner and avoid the actively expanding players."
503,2501,"This is a geeks dream: Coding to play.  My friend and I have been playing and having a blast. You have to code and anyone can learn to code.You will spend time reading doc api, brushing up and/or learning javascript. it can be very frustrating when things are just not working but when your creeps start doing what you expect you can sit and watch them. This game is made it to my top 10 so far. I expect it to get better.If you do not like pushing yourself a bit and learning something while you play then just pass by this game. However if you like that sort of thing then this is a game for you."
504,2500,"It's a good game, but while playing it gave me a popup asking me to review it on steam."
505,2500,"Great concept, well executed!"
506,2500,"Worth getting past the first four hours of ""oh god oh god oh god"". Not for non coders."
507,2500,"TL:DR; If you're interested in programming with javascript as a hobby, for school or work, this game is a must have. If you're not into programming and need a GUI to place objects, don't buy it and don't leave a negative review.Play the demo on the website to understand the basics, then buy screeps on steam. I would suggest to play on a local private server first to create a ""AI"" yourself or use one of the many github.com provided repositories **before** you active the 30 day free subscription on the server. It takes a couple of days before you get the hang of the game and get a script up and running.You start with one room, which grows slowly and steady and as your Room Control Level gets higher, you get access to more and more structures. Towers to defend against and heal creeps and to maintain other structures, terminal to trade resources and gain in-game credits, labs to use those resources and boost your creeps. Once you reach a higher Global Control Level (based on upgrading the Room's Controller), you can own more rooms and have a higher CPU limit (allowing you to take more time while executing your code). It all comes down to your code: how is it designed (room based, creep based, task based, operating system), how efficient is your code and how are things prioritised. Some areas are more hostile, which requires some extra defensive measurements and offensive capabilities to survive / expand. Unfortunately, the tutorial doesn't cover much more then the tower and spawn structures and you'll have to figure everything out yourself. On the plus side, this can be interpreted as an incentive to read the docs (and API docs), read blogs from others and check out thousands of public repositories on github.com. Subscribtion is paid, but it's possible to buy in-game subscription tokens with in-game credits. This could take a while tho. The same tokens are also sold/bought on the Steam marketplace.All in all, 10/10 recommended to anyone with an interest in programming with javascript. The game combines thinking about the general design of your code, with actual programming, PvP/PvE battles, alliances (LOAN!) and an active/chill community."
508,2500,It's the best RTS MMO I've ever played. Mostly because all the stupid timewasters the seem to be required in the genre can be automated.Only time I wouldn't recommend the game is if you don't know how to code and don't want to learn.
509,2500,Screeps is a really fun coding challenge!
510,2500,"I absolutely love Screeps. If you're a programming enthusiast looking to satisfy any coding urge while having fun, Screeps is certainly the game for you. Even if you're completely new to programming and are just curious as to how it works, Screeps would be an amazing introduction to both coding and problem solving. As a Computer Science student, I am constantly looking for more ways to improve my coding skills. Screeps seems to provide endless possibilities for code optimization, problem solving, usage of data structures, and memory management. Whether you're brand new to programming or a long standing veteran, I would certainly recommend this game to any interested in improving/learning coding."
511,2500,"I'm code noob, Im playing this game by watching tutorials and copy what hey make. Still when everything works it feels so cool. Nice game!Update: After 2 weeks I understand that I still understand anything about the game and cannot progress, game is a good test for yoursefl to tell can you do coding or not, When I was faced with coe problems I did not wanted to solve them and now I know - coding is not m thing. Game is amazing if you are in to code and also amazing tool to tell you is coding for you or not."
512,2500,"If you think you would like this game, you're probably right.If you think you would hate this game, you are also probably right.if you're interested in learning JavaScript and/or artificial intelligence, this game is great for that.  My advice if you're worried about the subscription is to buy the game anyway and just play it in single player (by which I mean running a server locally, not the little ""simulation"" room it gives you).  If you later decide you want to go online you can carry your code with you."
513,2500,"So good. No time to write a review, have to play more."
514,2500,"It's a great game offline, but once you go online the tick-rate goes from 5 ticks / second to 0.5 ticks per second. Moving across a room takes like an hour. The game becomes a lot less fun when your minions are moving around in slow motion.Great way to have fun while improving your Javascript skills though."
515,2499,"A really enjoyable game if you have any programming experience or want to improve your javascript knowledge and understanding. Can easily take up so much of your time, while you watch how you creeps interact and you think of ways to improve them. A very good game for programmers or want to be programmers."
516,2499,Beautiful game.  Great way to practice logic and structure.
517,2499,Nice game to learn programming with fun ;D
518,2499,Great for programmers
519,2499,This game is an absolute blast. Scratches the itch for programming and gaming without having to build your own from scratch.
520,2499,Amazing time sink. Played most of my time over the course of a few weeks. Due to the subscription model. Ended up not renewing due to real life commitments. Support is great and the community is even better.
521,2499,"I enjoy this game. Even though it is really only targeted for programmers it is still alot of fun. If you decide to play this game, try writing the code in typescript rather then javascript."
522,2498,"While not for the non-programmer, if you are into development this game has a great deal of interesting decisions to make and trade-offs to codify into your own AI.  I don't enjoy some aspects of the API, but I do enjoy that I can make up for a lot of those aspects and work around others.  I'm personally in the game for combat and cooperative AI systems, but being the sandbox that it is, there's a lot of game here for those that just like resource management or economic play."
523,2498,Great excuse to re-learn some JavaScript.
524,2498,"The game would be really really cool and fun, but the coding is almost impossible to even understand to basics.  It frustrates me to try to complete the tutorial, much less the actual game.  Maybe some actaul programmers might be able to play this game and have a lot of fun with it, but I can't.  I wish they made the game a little bit easier to understand, or just implemented a better tutorial."
525,2497,whats coding again?
526,2497,The best game for AI developer.
527,2497,"Ok, I have played this for about two weeks now, I am amazed. At first I thought it will be quite low level programming, but I can work with modules, dependency injection, I have to optimize code and prevent memory leaks, self invoking functions, looping iterations...Great fun after my daily job as a programmer :D."
528,2496,After leaving my job as a Javascript dev to explore new opportunities I ended up playing Screeps. Nothing really changed except that now I am unpaid.
529,2495,My son played this game in the hospital before he passed. I was hoping I could visit his creeps but they all seem to have passed too.
530,2495,"This game is more or less the difinition of a flop. The game idea is great however the studio (which is just one guy) failed us by not hiring consultants or programmers needed to make the game a success. So the actual game fell quite short of original expectations. There are many problems, a poorly designed API for players to work with and massivly over crowded servers. To make matters worse, all of the short comings of the game only help to produce more profit for the developers so fixes are non-existant at the players expense. If you need to purchase additional resources to offset the poor implementation of the API, well that just means more money for the developer, we are more likely to see de-optimization if we see anything at all. Over crowded servers cause huge amounts of lag, but since they can keep packing us in, they dont have to spend any money to upgrade infrastructure.At the end of the day, this game gets categorized with all the other scam games and asset flips on steam. Though to be fair, I dont think the developer intended it that way. Still, the developer has opted fro greed rather than player experience. I highly recommend not buying this title."
531,2494,"Great concept executed very very well. Inparticular, excellent pacing and complexity! I look forward to the endgame content.You will either love or hate this game so try the free trial!"
532,2494,"Charming, utterly different game experience to anything else I have ever played. I only have very rudimentary coding knowledge, but thanks to the tutorial and the community I have managed to create a small flourishing economy.While coders certainly will get more out of it than myself, the early challenges the game provides are interesting in their own right. I now have many different drones scripted to harvest, transport, defend and control. I need to keep track of production costs, harvest speeds, transport speeds and build priorities. Pretty much like in a regular RTS, but the beauty of Screeps is that you need to solve the puzzle of ""how"" while solving the puzzle of ""what"".The tutorial throws scripts at you without explaining all the elements of the scripts, so it can be difficult at first to stray from the provided examples. If you're into creative problem-solving and don't mind a bit of internet research, you'll accept this as part of the game. If your frustration tolerance is a bit too low for this, go to the slack group and ask someone to explain it to you (certainly faster that way).Have I actually learned programming now? Well, I've learned you can't just add two arrays together. Or that two drones with one task each are easier to debug than one complex drone with multiple tasks. I have also learned that after getting wiped by a NPC invader, having some of those complex multi-functional drones left is very valuable (no point harvesting if there is no one to collect). Or that simple conditions like ""is this full, then to that instead"" are stupid if the state of condition can fluctuate from second to second.There is a ton of good design theory you'll pick up playing Screeps and a sense of achievement you will not get from grinding-based games, so give it a try!"
533,2493,So much fun!
534,2493,Is good
535,2493,Seem pretty cool thus far. A good way to sharping your scripting skills. How about allowing other languages?
536,2492,"The game is pretty good actually, I'm a programmer though so it was a pretty easy start for me, otherwise it might be challenging to get on top of it. The developers made sure to mention that though, they seem like decent folks.The gameplay is decent, casual and well... Fun at times but the game is slow, kinda repetitive. I mean I enjoy the debugging and the catastrophes my code causes but this is a casual game not more and shouldn't be priced as it is priced now. That's mainly why I can't recommend it at all, not at this price. The game itself should be cheaper and the CPU costs per month are just ridiculous, yes they do say it's just on their servers but it is where the game was meant to be played and 10 CPUs are really nothing so if you don't pay the extras, you're pretty much screwed on their servers."
537,2492,Recommended for programmers and those willing to interact with programming.
538,2492,"This is an awesome game, and one I really enjoy. Upsides include:- Deep gameplay (how much AI can you write in an RTS? Have you thought of everything?)- Surprisingly good initial tutorial (you don't need to know a lot of javascript to play this, any experience scripting will do)- A simulation mode that lets you test things out without risking your live empire- Multiple worlds (shards) you can play on- Co-op and competitive multiplayer (just make sure any allies start the same time you do), with alliances- Slack channels, wikis etc, and a very complete API reference mean you can usually get the answer to your question- Real sense of progess as you watch your empire develop - even more so if you've got the AI you wrote making its decisions and agree with them.- Beating another player because your AI is better than theirs is an amazing experience. So, too, to a lesser extent, is watching your AI systematically dismantle NPC invaders.- The community of players IN GENERAL is smart, knowledgable, and nice. Exception: the players near you are quite likely to try murdering you in your sleep using tactics you never thought possible. This isn't because they hate you, though. This is just because you're mining resources they want.- If you want practice writing JavaScript, this is an incredibly fun way to get that practice.- The ability to write JavaScript is an incredibly useful skill, so even if you aren't attracted to the game for the sake of practice, the practice will still probably be valuable to you at some point. That said, there are some downsides:- This is a subscription game, in an era where there's essentially no such thing anymore as a subscription game. There's a good argument for it (your scripts run 24/7 even when you're offline), ways to play without paying a subscription (buy it on steam once, get a small amount of CPU forever), even exchange game currency for subscription time. But, ultimately, you are either paying with money every month, or you're paying with time. For some people, the fact it is a subscription game alone rules it out.- Combat can be brutal as a new player. While I have been doing fine, the outright majority of players I've seen start in my sector have either been murdered or abandoned their game within the first few days. TIP: if you start playing this, DO NOT start near a well-established player, as doing this means you have little chance of fighting back if they decide they want your resources for themselves.- It is very easy to make almost game-ending mistakes. Not got any defense AI when invaders start showing up? Aggress a player you can't handle? Left a bug in your code that causes it to fail to run properly just when you need it? Empires can fall due to tiny mistakes like these. While the tension is sometimes great, some people will find it insufferably annoying that they can lose huge chunks of progress just because of a misplaced ';' in their code. These people should probably not play this game. You have to have some patience for debugging.- The tutorial approaches scripting your AI from the wrong angle. While it is somewhat inevitable, given that it is aimed at new players, that it would take the simplest approach, it leads players down the path of having each unit make its own decisions. This works when you have 1 unit. Or 5 units. Or 10 units. It does not work when you have 100 units. At a certain point, if you follow this approach, you will realize that what you need is a sort of 'director' AI that assigns tasks to your units/creeps. This is a whole new level of AI programming that you will have to be willing to engage in to make real progress in this game, and the tutorial never mentions it, which is a major omission.- The main server, shard0, has a tick rate of about 5 seconds. This means that units only move or otherwise act once per 5 seconds. There is a second server, shard1, which has a MUCH faster tick rate of about 2 seconds. As well as newer players in general. If you are starting out, you almost certainly want to start on shard1.... but shard0 is still the default, for some reason. This might seem like a nitpick, but it actually makes a huge difference to the game to play it at half speed. Whenever you're waiting for anything... you wait twice as long.- This is a 24/7 game. Your empire exists 24/7. Your code runs 24/7. You can be attacked 24/7. There are few things as annoying as getting game alerts telling you that your empire is being wiped out while you're at work, or otherwise busy. Or even worse, seeing them in the morning after you wake up. You can script your AI to deal with this somewhat, but you also have to be prepared that it might, at times (rarely) interrupt your life to push you to deal with some crisis - or you might come back to an empty wasteland next time you sign in.- You MUST be willing to read the documentation. You MUST be willing to read a lot in general. There are some things about the game, seemingly minor (like the fact that rooms beyond a certain level attract MUCH stronger NPC attacks) which aren't mentioned in-game, but are on the wiki/API documentation. If you've read the docs well, you will know them. If you haven't, you can get blindsided when the enemies you face are suddenly 4x stronger for no identifiable reason. That's just one example - there are many others.- The longer you play, the less your empire changes on a day-to-day basis. You still have work to do, but progress is clearest in the first few days, where you're expanding more quickly. After that, it becomes ever more incremental until, eventually, you will probably settle into a position of relative stability - unless you are willing to go to war with a neighbor to expand further.Who should/shouldn't buy this game:- If you want practice writing JavaScript, or enjoy scripting things in general, definitely DO buy this game.- If you don't like the idea of writing code, hate the idea of debugging, or aren't willing to read around, DO NOT buy this game.- If you're not sure if you enjoy writing code, but are an RTS fan, I still encourage you to pick up this game and try to learn to write code - its a valuable skill and it will give you HUGE strategic and tactical insight you can use in other games. Not to mention teaching you a valuable skill in a fun way. Plus, frankly, I find it more satisfying to write the code to handle attacking, defending, etc, than I do micromanagement. If you're big into micromanagement (a la StarCraft) maybe this is not for you. If you're big into big-picture thinking, automation, etc (a la Total Annihilation, Factorio, etc) then this may well be for you.- If you're not sure if you enjoy RTS games, and have no experience writing code.... play another few RTS games, and try writing some other code for something, before you try this."
539,2491,A very good game!
540,2491,"Want to learn Javascript in the most fun way possible? This is your game.Already know Javascript and want to try to work on some A.I. logic? This is your game.Already know a lot about A.I. and want to show off your skills in a unique realtime mmo environment? This is your game.Enjoy gorgeous visuals, fluid animation and a soundtrack that you just can't get enough of? This is not your game...For an experienced programmer who always dreamed of writing game code but instead chose to get paid, this game is an 11/10.0 bugs encountered so far.frequent updates.good documentation."
541,2490,"Great idea, well executed. More fun to play than I anticipated.Steep learning curve for newbies, but very rewarding. Long term motivation is definitely there.The only negative feedback I'd give the developers is that the payment model is a reach. I bought the game, but I'm not going to buy a subscription. I know of several people interested in the game but it's just too expensive for the kind of game it is.If it cost a third, people might think about it.My thumbs up means the following: Try the game in tutorial and simulation mode (even if you're not a programmer, but interested). If you like what you see there, think about buying it - maybe in a Steam sale. And if they fix their pricing model, buy a subscription."
542,2489,"A great game for programmers that have a moderate knowlage of javascript programming. I wouldn't reccamend for someone who has never programmed before. because it could be complitcated at first, but once you get your ""civilization"" started it takes off and you can do basically anything with your Screeps."
543,2488,text needed to write review
544,2488,"If you already have some experience with coding and have at any point thought to yourself either ""man, it'd be cool if I could use this to play a game instead of doing anything productive"" or ""well, I guess I should know *something* about Javascript"" drop everything and check out the free demo available on the games' website.If you *don't* have any experience with coding you should still head over and try the free demo on the the game's website, but be prepared for a stopover at the recommended Javascript tutorial. Screeps may not be the most practical introduction to programming, but it's both extremely fun and quite accessible, just be ready to do a little homework."
545,2488,This game is awesome... im currently taking preap computer science in high school and this game is a good refresher from taking a break over the summer XD
546,2487,The first time I ran the game I got a pop up asking for a Steam review.So here it is.
547,2487,"This game works great as a wallpaper, you always have something to look at.Coding your own AI is fun too."
548,2486,"I installed Node.js, Atom, VS 2017 and Git only to end up using my old Javascript code when my advanced Typescript spawning code broke down for reasons unknown (aka I probably try to control someone else's spawner or something). 11/10 would play it again.Oh, btw, if anyone knows how to make it work with coffeescript, please go ahead and let me know"
549,2486,"Have some Java expirience before and no javascript at all.It wasn't hard to start developing colony, but became more complicated and interesting over time.This game is not a tutorial or learning book for javascript. But if you would like to succeed, you will have more that enought motivation to learn javascript yourself, according to tasks that games throws upon you.I'm definitely like it.BTW, not hard to start at all, if you patient enought to watch some tutorials on youtube, maybe go thru game tutorial and google some stuff (anyway programming is often about searching some information).p.s.Total games, (not including screeps) in Steam profile: 30. First bought 2013. Total hours for all games (not including screeps) spent 696.Screeps:Bought august 2017.Played 412 hours from start till november 2017 and there are still intresting tasks to code here. :-)Should I called it addicting?"
550,2486,I hate JavaScript. But this game forces me to love it.
551,2486,"First, a caveat: my only experience with this game is on a private server I run on my VPS.  Playing on the official servers is a whole other ball game, I'm sure.  I'm probably not going to mess with that for a while.I'm probably going to update this review eventually once my friends and I start getting more into the competitive aspects, but, suffice to say, I recommend it for anyone who knows how to code, appreciates strategy games, and wants a nice break from the sort of click-heavy, fast-paced titles that dominate the RTS genre.  The API is a little clunky and javascript is a poor choice of language for this type of application, but, once you get used to the environment, there are a whole host of interesting mechanics that make this game insanely fun to play.  It's complex, to be sure, but not so time-consuming as you might be led to believe---often, you don't have to do more than a quick check every now and then followed by a short bugfix or livecoding sprint to introduce a new unit type or behavior.  It's easy to get sucked into it late at night, but, other than that, pretty low-maintenance overall.  I could see playing this game with a full-time job and kids, which is not something I'd suggest about most games on the market today.  Again, that doesn't necessarily hold true for public server play, which requires payment of a large subscription fee I suspect the experience isn't worth.If you don't know anything about code whatsoever, I'd learn that first.  This is not primarily an educational game.  That said, expertise with javascript /per se/ is optional; it's more important to have a basic understanding of how the game logic works, and ---I cannot stress this enough---to have read the manual and played the tutorial."
552,2486,"If you don't know any javascript (which I didn't), this is a serious challange.  You have to enjoy coding.  If you don't, don't buy! If you do, this is awesome."
553,2486,"TL;DRIf you are programmer - 10/10If you are just player - 0/10REVIEWMain aimSo, your main aim is keep your colony in safe. You need main a energy, produce new creeps, defense from bots and players. Also you can trade by selling energy and other resourcesMiningThis is 100% of all time in this game. If you in war with other player, then you anyway should keep mining processes.You should mine energy for produce new creeps or build new structures, but you can mine other resources. Resources are used for boosting your creeps, produce super-creep or for tradeTradeGame are have in-game currency. You can buy or sell energy, boosts or resources for boosts. All what you can carry and transfer you can buy or sellWarThis game doesn't have friend list. You can just send a message to someone and all, nothing more. So many players in war with together, someone is join in alliance and war with other alliance. Somewhere you can find map of alliances :)How it's workYou should program your own colony by writing code in JS, TS or Python (Game support only JS, but community add support for other languages). Code is uploading on server and run from start every tick.Screeps have a documentation, but it's basics thing, you should create logic of colony yourself"
554,2486,Accidently commits self-genocide by deleting everyones brains in a coding mistake10/10 would commit self-genocide again
555,2485,"The concept of Screeps is very appealing. I started playing it with very limited knowledge of JS and have come a long way since. The basics can be gotten from Youtube videos and the tutorial, which is well set up, and the Slack community is more than willing to help out on any issue, big or small. The fact that the game's community is as helpful really makes the difference. I think this can be a great game for anyone ranging from beginners starting with Javascript to the more seasoned devs looking for a challenge in optimisation ;) Definitely recommended"
556,2485,"I'm still very new to screeps but so far its awesome. It's all the fun of coding, themed around a RTS whats not to love? All the warnings about the learning curve should be noted though, try out the simulator online!"
557,2485,"Not sure if I'm learning to code or just learning how to get more efficient with rooms.Can be frustrating at first if you are new to coding in general, but after a few respawns and getting beaten up by other players, settling in the perfect room and getting things running makes the game fun to watch.Code needs to be actively adapted to your situation. Unless of course you plan on writing a code which can setup and progress without you taking a look at any of the rooms, which basicly means you beat the game and can now leave."
558,2485,"I screeps in the morning.  I screeps at night.I think they have started watching me.  I have begun to notice snippets of code in my dreams.  It is possible that really, the whole universe is actually a game, and it is the screeps are programming us."
559,2485,"If you're willing to waste countless hours and stay up in the pursuit of improving your program, this is the game for you. If you don't have time to waste, I'm sure you will find more time to gradually improve your code. No matter if you've just started or if you're 1000+ hours deep, if you have the capabilities you can become the best."
560,2485,This game is fantastic. You do need to have some basic scripting ability but not much. If you can work some simple websites with JavaScript buttons and navigation you will likely be able to get started on this game. Take a look at the simulator and do the tutorials before you decide to buy it.
561,2485,"Its good, but i think you should really make a DLC where there is no actual coding. Because me and most of my friends really want to play this game but don't know how to code!"
562,2485,"Great game for programmers and by far the best programming game I have ever played. Pros: Well populated, active community, actively developed, uses a real programming language, easy to understand api.Cons: Javascript is not the friendliest language for beginners, graphics are basic, can be buggy, This game has kept my attention for a long time and seems to have a very good and logical sense of progression. My advise is if you can code get this game if you can't don't."
563,2484,"Brilliant game. Others have dwelt on the programming aspect, but the game design itself is superb. Like all the best games, it takes a small number of simple elements and combines them to create huge possibilities.There are constant hard choices to make: do I spend energy on infrastructure, expansion, defence, upgrades...? There is never enough cpu, memory, energy, or other resources. Do I write a sophisticated algorithm to better exploit resources - but then I'm low on cpu - and so on.You can spend as much time on this as you like. There are always tweaks and optimisations to make, new ideas to try. Alternatively you can walk away for a month, come back, and see how your AI is faring.The feel of the game is a bit like EVE Online. It's a brutal PvP world where potential disaster is constantly lurking. There are 'real' consequences if you screw up. But when some code comes together and you emerge triumphant - it's a rush! Even getting wiped out is kind of fun. How did that happen? What was the other guy doing that I wasn't? How should I improve my code base for the next attempt?Once up and running you don't need to spend a lot of time on it if you don't want to. However I recommend setting aside most of a day for a first run as you need to get your empire to a certain level before you can let it run unassisted. You need to get basic harvesting, production, and defence online. From scratch that can take a few hours."
564,2484,Do not buy this game without algorithmic javascript experience; If you have that - I highly recommend it. This was a good excuse to learn Javascript syntax. Most things that happen in the game happen over several days or hours at least. FYI.
565,2484,Disclaimer I am not a programmer and went into this game with little to no programming expireince. This game so far is very fun to play. I have enjoyed learning the language and coding my AI. if you have patience then this game will be for you. pros your colony is always online so if your code works it will continue to work always.good comunity welcoming of new players.conscan be quite hard to start out. takes a lot of learning to play well.
566,2484,"This is an incredible game if you enjoy programming, optimizing systems and learning game mechanics and how to best leverage them.As many reviews have stated, this game is most accessible to people with existing programming knowledge of the basics. For those interested in the game or having a difficult time getting up to speed, I highly recommend watching the Screeps videos by YouTuber thPionGaming (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0EZQ169YGlor5rzeJEYYPE3tGYT2zGT2).Full marks to the developers for making such a unique, creative and innovative game!"
567,2484,Very cool & fun game !
568,2484,the game is good but its  too hard to people who dont learn java script
569,2484,Awesome game!if(u.code && u.playsGames){      u.games.add(this.game);}
570,2483,"EDIT:If you are still unsure after reading all the other reviews, please use the simulator at https://screeps.com/a/#!/sim/tutorialYou do not need to register or anything, just try it and see how this game looks for you!This game is a programing game, and a programing game only.So it comes with all its advantages and disadvantages, for example the relief and accomplishment feeling if something works as intended but as well if something goes horribly wrong.If you do not fix your mistakes, either because you can't find them or don't have the time to do it, this will slowly have an impact on your colony, as creeps die approx. every hour (on shard1) and you lose controller level if no creep upgrades it resulting in fewer construction possibilities as well as no new energy to do things if no creep harvest it.You can always rehab from this as your scripts stay and you always have a base energy you can work with to spawn simple creeps, so there is that. Everyone who programmed, knows how frustrating it can be to not find an error in your program or something does not behave like you want it to do. You will have that. A lot. Like always in programing, so keep that in mind. For me, the advantages of actively seeing my steady improving code in a live environment visually outvages the disadvantages heavily. If you ask yourself, can i program in this game with javascript? Can i learn with it?, i have an answer for you. It depends solely on you. You see reviews where people complain this is not for learners, others say it is easy to get into. I can only share my experience i had, and i tell you: I've never done anything in javascript. Nothing. I worked a little with C, with C#, PHP, and other stuff, but always just a little. Not that i would call me in anyway some expert, i don't do it for a living. And i can well maintain my colony, you just need to understand logic to program, programing language matters little as you have some code snippets in the api where everything is well enough explained (i used it almost always for everything) as well as more and more users releasing some of their starter scripts where you can copy it, use it, and then improve it to your advantages. So i would say: Go for it, go and buy the steam version without subscription in the first place. But if you know yourself you struggle with simple coding (no matter what language) or just hate to be frustrated because of syntax or non-syntax errors, as well as never haven't programmed even something basic yourself, you may as well be better without it. You decide!"
571,2483,Fun concept but it is hurt badly by the fact that Javascript is a trainwreck of a language. You can try using other languages that compile into Javascript but it's very awkward getting the Screeps API to work with it.
572,2483,Excellent game for programmers who want to write AI without writing all the rest of the game
573,2483,Not worth paying the subscription unless you are actually willing to play
574,2483,"This is a great game for anyone who knows Javascript. However, it's a HELL of a learning curve if you don't, difficult to learn, but rewarding as hell. Definetly recommended for the mentally advanced."
575,2483,"This is not a ""Learn to code"" game, this is an ""I'm already an expert in Javascript"" game.FWIW, I have some experience with PHP and SQL, but I've never touched JS.The learning curve is a sheer cliff. Might well be fun if you ARE an expert JS programmer, but then you probably do this for work and don't want to spend your free time doing it."
576,2482,"Great game if you love to program, or would like to learn it. Has enough depth to keep you busy for a while, and optimizing your code can take months. Only downside is that your code needs to be running for about a month before you can claim your 2nd room as your own, instead of ""reserving"" it.The 10 CPU this purchase gives you is well enough to keep your scripts running for the first 2 or 3 rooms, and thus for the first 3 or 4 months. After that, you really need to start optimizing your scripts, earn CPU with ingame minerals, or buy a small package, as the 10 CPU is not enough to keep your scripts running for 4 rooms or more."
577,2482,"I always wanted a MMO game, where I do not have to be online all the time, but where I can write a script to do boring stuff for me and I can concentrate on the actual strategy. That game is Screeps for me. It is quite hard at the beginning (I myself got destroyed completely after a month or two), but it is quite easy to restart, since you keep your Global control level.You should know, that you need to buy subscription tokens as compensation for the server costs, but it is also possible to buy the subscription ingame from other players using resources."
578,2482,"This is an amazingly deep, extremely well done, no significant bugs/issues, works from the web (there is also a steam client). It's pretty complex if you want to compete (you can always play locally on a personal server), but with enough time you end up with a complex library of code managing a bunch of stuff, balancing plates on sticks and jumping through loops to get things done.It's a 100% programming based game, you cannot control units or create anything without using code. I never saw that kind of game before and it's pretty damn insane, I really like it.If you don't know how to program, I imagine it would be quite a task to compete. I have a pretty buff experience in programming so I'm doing reasonably well but it's still a challenge.Last comment, the game has a slow pace. The tutorial is highly sped up vs the online experience, there is no speed button online and ticks are approx 3-5 seconds long, sometimes more, so it really takes forever to get anything done vs the 500 speed sim :)I highly recommend this game, it's fantastic, unique and a lot of fun.Ps: I have more hours than what's displayed here because I'm mainly playing the web version and it doesn't log into steam. I have prob 50 hrs so far prob more (at the time of making this review)."
579,2482,"Screeps is an amazing game for anyone interesting in programming, logic, and strategy games. It's got a long but smooth learning curve as you grow from managing a couple of miner-workers to building out custom roles & automating your bases, expansions, war and more. You'll go from small scale planning to optimizing the efficiency of your burgeoning hive empire in a few months.This game offers something great for beginner coders and experienced professional developers. The community around it is one of the friendly and helpful I've seen for any game or online coding experience."
580,2481,"Screeps is a really fun programming game that is basically all about efficiency.  Early on you have a lower CPU limit that you are unlikely to hit.  However you need to get your room up and running as quickly as possible.  Later on you have a CPU limit that you'll need to manager, a memory limit, while making sure that multiple rooms are being managed optimally.This game is not intended for someone who doesn't know or want to learn code.  It primarily uses javascript and without using code you can do nothing.  Every aspect of the game from spawning a creep(your units) to making a tower attack or a creep do anything has to be coded by the player.  The game's UI allows for some things to be setup without using code, buildings' construction sites can be placed, your initial spawn can be placed through the UI.  You can select a unit and see it's memory pretty easily as well.Even though the online game is running 24/7 and the game is made to use code that is constantly automating your units you will likely always find something to do and if not you probably aren't being creative enough.  My code has gone through multiple optimizations and will likely always be getting improved.  You can also play on a dedicated private server as well.  A lot of fun seeing a slow start at the beginning and then starting on a new map and seeing how much better the new code runs and how much easier the game is with my newer better code.If you like to code, love a lot of flexibility along with sensible limits you'll love this game.  While at it's core it's a coding game, the online gives it a bit of a RTS feel as well!"
581,2481,Apparently my original review was a bug and I'm happy that they actually took time to go through reviews and respond. It's a great game and helped me learn JS in the funnest way I've learned a language thus far.Original: Stop being a mobile app and begging for my review.
582,2481,"The tick rate is so slow that I got bored very early on.  I wrote fairly complicated scripts, but didn't have the patience to see if they actually ran.There is a simulation mode that, at its fastest rate (+500%) runs at what I would call a reasonable rate.Was it worth $15 to try out?  Yes.  Was the tutorial version a good indication of real game play?  Absolutely not.I will probably never log in again."
583,2481,"Love the game.  If you can code you'll love it.  I was very hesistant to buy at first because of the subscription and a couple of bad reviews, but unless you're trying to dominate the world you can have a lot of fun from the start.  I started building good harvesters, then builders, then figure how to make them more efficient so I could have more creeps within the 30 CPU you get as a newbie.  Stuff like finding more efficient routes, not getting in the way of each other... actually use the roads efficiently, don't change paths or building targets every 5 ticks, etc.  Now, after a week and about a couple of thousand lines of code I have 15 creeps running with about 12 CPU, so I could go to 30, but my problem is I'm already using all the energy available in this room... So time to expand and go harvest in nearby rooms.  And I haven't even started on war creeps.  8/10"
584,2480,Great for people who love programming!
585,2480,"Overall 8/10;  A simple game with complex problems to solve.  Overview:Excellent game for Programmers.  !!!!!!Free version available via web browser!!!!!!- check that out before you commit to buying anything!!!!!Would recommend beginners use TypeScript. Languages other than JavaScript are supported. See below.Warning: building from scratch is time consuming.First I have enjoyed this game a lot.  Good enough that it is the first non-work programing I have done since college.  Like most good programs however this will take time, especially in getting the basic framework up and running.  Not necessarily a bad thing in my opinion but still a hassle.  If you can find someones code that you can understand and figure out how to modify after you get a hold of the commands and API I would recommend finding someone elses already built basic functions code and modify it to your tastes.  There are lots out there and even fully automated complete ones.  Basic functions include: harvesting energy and minerals, auto build basic buildings, auto repair, auto basic defense with at least turrets and 1 unit type available,  and auto spawn units/ hopefully with a priority que or similar.  Bonus if it includes building, pathing, and harvesting in other rooms.  From there you can tweak the code for optimization all you want and build your custom units/defense and plan your expansion/domination.  It takes a bit of the fun and challenge out of it but it will save your countless hours.  At the time of this writing Im 75 coding hours into my session and i have only managed to do basic harvesting of energy, build, repair, and poor spawning method without a que yet.  I have much planned and could probably spend the same number of hours optimizing the pathing and functions of the units I have without even getting to defense or attack.  Second, I bought this game without realizing that it has a free version which disappointed me as, more than a week in, I have not passed the free 10 CPU limit on the main server so Im pretty much wasting the extra CPU I paid for.  Check out the free version, get your basic code setup, as soon as you are happy with the basics move on to the main server.  Honestly Im not even ready for the main server yet but I wanted to give it a go anyway.  you can do almost everything in simulation with unlimited cpu without paying so I would suggest you do that and then if you want to go to the main server and you need the extra CPU buy it them.The game is written in JavaScript.  The steam client version has a built in IDE for JavaScript but it could be a bit better.  That is mostly JavaScript's fault however.  I would recommend looking up articles about TypeScreeps.  It shows you how to code in your own IDE with TypeScript for screeps which is a lot friendlier for programers, especially beginners.  There are setup instructions and everything out there.  More importantly it supports some other languages via conversion and even a portion of c natively for pathing and some other stuff so if you would rather use those then I would recommend it. Honestly the steam client version vs acess via web browser is that there is no setup on your computer to do.  It has its own premade environment with easy to use commit, branch, and change active code functions.  Very nice but probably doesn't make up for it not being a professional/your favorite IDE.  Cheers."
586,2480,"What Screeps isn't: a way to learn about programming or even Javascript.What Screeps is: Create your own RTS AI. The tutorial is essentially just ""Here are a few examples and here is the API. Have fun!""I highly recommend it to anyone with programming experience. I could program but did not know Javascript. This was a good excuse to learn Javascript syntax."
587,2480,"Great, very addictive. Always a ways to optimize your scripts and improve stuff."
588,2480,"if (You.knowHowToCode) {   purchaseThisGame(cardNum, expDate, secCode);} else {   while(!You.knowHowToCode) {      You.learnToCode();   }   purchaseThisGame(cardNum, expDate, secCode);}"
589,2480,Great game
590,2479,Super fun game that helps you keep fresh on your Javascript. Takes a little to get down but the API is incredible and thorough.
591,2479,"excellent game 8/10Disclaimer: I haven't played for very long and I'm still yet to experience combat and have not yet left the novice area. Pros:- Can be simple or complex- Lots of information/examples online- Rewarding and addictive- Can play on private server for faster Gameplay- You actually learn and improve your programming and problem solvingCons:- Main online server is kinda slow (can avoid by playing on a private server with friends and/or bots)- Game tutorials can get a little needlessly complicated (proabbly not a problem if you have experience with Javascript)TL,DR:  At first I didn't knowa thing about Javascript, but 3 days later I have an autonomous mining base up and running!When I first saw this game I was intimidated by the programming, thinking that I wouldn't be able to do anything at all, but luckily I tried it out regardless.Not gonna lie, at first the programming is quite overwhelming, especially because I hadn't used Javascript before and my only other experience in programming is getting an LED to turn on with an arduino lol. If you haven't got any background in Javascript i highly recoomend spending the time do go through some online tutorials before doing the games tutorials, otherwise you probably wont be able to understand what the tutorials are teaching you. (CodeAccademy worked for me, and its free!) After going through CodeAccademy and the game's tutorials briefly (and help from online resources like http://docs.screeps.com/api) , I was able to get myself a fully functioning autonomous mining base set up in less than 3 days.If you're considering not buying this game because of its coding, I urge you to reconsider, as you'll be missing out on good fun."
592,2479,"Great game, very addictive. Fantastic way for people who want to learn how to program to learn. Good documentation and some good tutorial series if needed out on youtube."
593,2479,"programming MMO that easy to set up private servers to play with your friends. A+, lots of fun. has a decent amount of depth that i havent even scrachted."
594,2478,Not sure if this game will last because of  the subscription only thing. I like coding so this is cool to me.
595,2478,"Overall, I give Screeps a positive review. I've been looking for a programming based MMO ever since I was introduced to a game called Asheron's Call (now shut down) and the ability to use plugins to script bot control. It was rudimentary, but fun.Screeps is near exactly what I've been searching for, but it isn't without its caveats. I've been growing, testing, and refactoring my code for some time now, and I can say that it is worth its full initial price, though I happened to pick it up on sale. The API is well documented and thought out.What needs to be said though, is that in its current state, you are better off testing by running in simulation mode, than on the public server (you could also run your own private server for testing). The average tick time on the public server is around 4-5 seconds, where in simulation mode, 100% speed runs at 1 second per tick. As you can imagine, this could make it hard to iterate your codebase. There are some plans that have been made public to upgrade the servers, so only once those plans come to fruition would I reccommend purchasing a subscription for extra CPU - if you need it. You may find that if you only plan to expand to 2 or 3 rooms that the free 10CPU you get with the game is enough to sustain you, if your code is efficient enough.Overall, its a unique game you won't find anywhere else, it is truly in a genre in its own. That can't be said for many other games today."
596,2478,"Screeps is the first and best game I've ever found for programmers. I can get absolutely lost in the gameplay for hours (I.E. writing code) and you can even play the game from the website with no download, so I find myself checking in and making slight modifications to my scripts throughout the day on my mobile phone. The API is very well documented so it's incredibly easy to jump in, and building up your code base can be extremely gradual or very quick, so it's great for experienced coders and for those learning.I go to work and program in PHP, HTML, and JavaScript for 10 hours a day and yet when I get home, I find myself able to continue programming JS for Screeps for another 4+ hours; just can't get tired of it! This is an absolutely wonderful game for both experienced and nooby programmers. I highly recommend it!Since this is a review after all, I'll give my one criticism: they do run your scripts 24/7 on a server, so there is a subscription fee for the game. This makes it feel slightly pay to win, because if you play for free you get way lower processing power for running your scripts. I understand why it is this way, but that doesn't mean I have to like it. The initial purchase of the game does include one month for free, however, so try it out and decide if it's worth subscribing or not after a month."
597,2478,"I have to read documentation for my game, it's great."
598,2478,"Best programming game I've ever played. Dangerously addictive. Now, when I stop  coding in JavaScript for work, I go home and code JavaScript for my creeps."
599,2478,Interesting
600,2478,"If you ever wanted to write an AI for a video game. Well the devs didn't do that here, its up to you!"
601,2478,"So far so good! I love the concept and what I have seen so far. Truth be told it's just the tutorial and I am about to embark on the adventure of conquering the world (of screeps) with my programming skills.I have a very good feeling about this, but it could go either way. I will update this review as I go along.So do I recommend this game? From what I have seen so far, yes, to an audience that enjoys coding. I, for one, do. I enjoy coding and I enjoy learning about new programming languages, and tackle new challenges with them. This game should be right up my alley. I am cautiously optimistic - the devil is in the details though, and again, I will update this review as I progress with the game."
602,2478,"Great game, I'm learning and getting better at JS every day!"
603,2477,"Love this game, I'll list my personal PROs/CONs.PRO: Great way to get into programming, specifically Javascript On the above point, it has a great tutorial with a good starting point for your code, so you can ""add on"" to what it gives you instead of making everything from scratch. Solid Base Building Concepts Your ""units"" are entirely of your design. Image starcraft or Warhammer Dawn of War, but you can make the units literally anything. I made a unit to upgrade my base, a unit to repair walls, a unit to harvest energy, and a unit that has crazy ranged attack, and a unit that specifically follows the unit with the range attack. You add ""body parts"" (WORK, CARRY, MOVE, TOUGH, ATTACK, RANGEATTACK, etc) to customize units.  With one click of the mouse, you can start a personal server offline so you can play against computers (Who are dumb as hell). This is good if you're nervous about being bad at the game at first and don't want to go onlineCONs: No sounds or music. I understand this game is meant to be a ""Make your code, walk away for a day, come back and make updates"", but it'd be cool to have some. Not a lot of documentation. There's a website that has functinos and whatnot, but I found explainations to be lacking. For example, on the official website I couldn't find how much unit body parts cost, I had to go 3rd party. For something like Minecraft, and having to go to a 3rd party wiki, that's fine. But this game is very indepth. No UI scaling. I have a 4k Monitor and clicking around the UI and trying to read text is a pain."
604,2477,"I could sleep...but what if this new code I wrote for my harvesters has a glitch? I guess while I'm waiting to check that, I can improve my spawning algorithm some more..."
605,2477,"Please be aware, to fully enjoy this game, you need to pay 8  / M.Otherwise, you can only have very little amound of ""CPU"" wich you need to let your algorithms run."
606,2477,I'm an intermediate programmer and this game is a great test of skill for me. The game is best described as a cold war of programmers--whoever can create the best systems wins.
607,2477,I go to work and write .js all day. I come home and write .js all night. No regrets.
608,2477,If programming is your passion then this game is an absurd amount of fun.
609,2477,Great game for progammers and people who'd like to become one.One of the best communities I've seen so far.
610,2477,"This game ticks so many boxes.. I'm an Automation Engineer, so i write code for a living (but not Java).. I have abit of an idea where to start from. The game itself is slow paced, relaxing, stressfull and very rewarding.I enjoy it, but im not very good at it and still learning :)"
611,2476,Love this game!
612,2476,"My god. This game is crack for programmers.I love this game with a passion, but there are some things to note.1. As of this date, 6/19/2017, the main server is overloaded.As such, the game crawls at a snail's pace....This will hopefully be addressed relatively soon.In the meantime, I recommend getting a basic resource mining base running, and testing more robust live code on private servers or the simulation before deploying more complicated code to the slow as all hell main server.2. This is a subscription based game in addition to the base game's cost.... Unless you're intending to play solo forever (dumb), or join up with only a few friends on a private server for all eternity (also dumb, in my opinion) ...The monthly fee is fairly reasonable given how unique this game is.But it's not apparent right up front, that you need to buy CPU processing power monthly.3. They really need to give us more CPU processing power.That all said, I love this game. So, so, so much."
613,2476,Lots of fun to learn.
614,2476,Is a really fun game ^^ a great way to have fun while programming
615,2476,"Love the idea of combining learning something useful, and gaming. It is difficult to get started, but once you're in it's so satisfying. And don't mind that the game uses Javascript, you'll probably spend more time on your code and algorithms than on the language itself. I think it's a good investment to those who want to learn to code, but don't know what projects to build, there's plenty of opportunity in this game."
616,2476,After purchasing the game I still need to pay a subscription? forget it.
617,2475,THis game turns out to be very expensive and has a huge learning curve up front. To really enjoy the game it appears you will have to pay a monthly subscription fee. They offer a free Twitter promo that you take advantage of but it doesn't seemt o be enough to make the game worth playing. I'm not sure how this game continues to get suck high praise but I think it's a failure due to the upfront purchase of the title and the high priced subscription for what this is.
618,2475,Great game. Good way to learn programming concepts.
619,2474,What do you do for your job? .... CodingWhat do you do for hobby? ... CodingTruly a game for coder.
620,2474,"Video is extremely misleading. Online play is beteween 50 and 100 times slower than shown. And I bought this game to compete with other people, not to learn how to program.Tutorial / programming model is also atrocious, it's stuff you'd expect to find from a 1990's VB programmer. Not fun for a real software developer."
621,2473,great game for learning javascript or programming in general
622,2473,"Would reccomend buying the game for some coding game play and to learn the coding along the way.But Stayaway from subscriptions is what i would recommond for longer or competetive game play not worth it but for intial fun and run its fine. longer runs not so great. why reccomend the game .1. learn while gamming concept. [real nice and exciting for a lot people.]2.you get the feel of achivment and enjoying the game forgetting you are even learning 3. takes or motivates you to the next level of coading faster due to the challenges facing4.you will have the game with you so you can play when ever you feel like but just the online mode is timed.5. you can still play with your buddies if you can make an dedicated serer or by using lan and stuff as well, if you know how to setup but it wont be hard at this point. when you are able to get good enough to play the game you are good enough to know or ready enough to know how to do that.6.worth your money for the game itself, so it wont be such a down as you can always play it with your buddies.why away from subscriptions??1.check the negative comments to know it by yourself (y not)they are in detailed, it was well commented or reviewed by many.2. you will end up going an uphill for longer runs!! for pay to win or more like Hit the wall coding. or lack of speed or lack of resources to tackle the ones who already have them.(being lazy dont wanna write them all down when ppl already described it in so detail in -ve reveiw's ^-^, just check them out. )"
623,2473,"I love the concept. I have participated in the google AI challenges exactly because I love to pit my AI against others...The problem with this game is threefold though (and just too much to look over)1. You have to write Javascript.2. The API to the game is far from being modern and ugly as  (passing const numbers to functions to alter their behaviour all the time, checking for errors as expected behaviour (eg. do check whether a unit is out of range check for a returned ERR_OUT_OF_RANGE, instead of having - say - a method to check whether you are in range), you are required to give unique names to all units (why on earth would you care for their names?) etc.etc.)3. The buildin functions are badly programmed. Eg. you can tell a unit to go to a specific spot and the pathfinding will be done by the game - it will be done on every tick though, even if the old path would still be valid! In the process it will often swap between different paths, many of which are not even shortest paths! It is no wonder you have rent additional CPUs to do anything with such internals (+ point 1).All in all I am very disappointed. I was very excited when I first saw the description of the game. After playing the Tutorial I already knew that I would not waste any more time with this though :-("
624,2473,"Excellent Game, getting started is pretty simple with the tutorials but expansion and keeping all your creeps and stuff going gets harder and harder and requires you to learn more and more code."
625,2472,"As a sometimes hobby, I've fiddled a lot with javascript over the years but never anything truly comprehensive; still, this game looked facsinating--  I'm pleased to say that It is! After years of sifting through source code in an attempt to figure things out, I now know wtf a boolean is, along with what it means when JSONLint validator tells me it was expecting script and got undefined... and more of the like. There's a handy link to a fairly simple step-by-step program on learning basic scripting skills and it WORKED! It's neat to see your little guys run around and do what you tell it to do... after inputting the tedious scripting needed, it's very rewarding. Especially knowing it helps me in other areas outside of the game. :) This is NOT for everyone, no-- then again, coding isn't for everyone, either. Only a select few of us nuts are crazy enough to love a game designed to help you code better! Only a few hours in but it's now in my favorites category!"
626,2472,"Screeps is a multiplayer real time strategy game where everyone plays the way they want to. With a feature rich combat system, full freedom in base construction, and a real economy, I have the option of being a warmonger, an isolationist, a businessman, or anything else I choose.Of course, I will have to fight to defend my way of playing by using every trick in the book to thwart my enemies when they make advances.This game offers endless choices to the player, literally encouraging you to develop your own program to dictate how you will manage your territory, units, and structures. It has a great community of active and communicative players who love to have friendly brawls and surprise each other with new and unique approaches to combat and defense. Some players are bent on world domination, while others are engrossed in the details of maximum efficiency for resource handling and economics. The great thing is all groups of players tend to enjoy sharing their knowledge.The Screeps API is so thorough and easy to navigate that the only limitation you should ever encounter is your skill, and for that, practice makes perfect. Why not practice developing while playing screeps?"
627,2472,"Game is gudSeriously tho, if you have any interest in coding of any kind. Grab this and learn/master/struggle with javaScript all the while expanding your circular empire."
628,2472,This has become my favorite game. I originally found the game while looking for a way to learn javascript. The game is well documented online and has a good tutorial to teach you some of the basics. Many members of the community are willing to help and mentor you. I have been playing now for about 7 months and have logged over 1000 hours. It has helped me to accomplish my goal of learning javascript.
629,2472,"I am old. Last time when I programming something for fun in real programming language, that was on C64.I almost forgot about this kind of passion, when i found this game.It's gave me a reason to start coding again, and feel the joy of logical thinking.Thanks for teaching me to fishing, and not gave me a fish;)"
630,2471,I really am enjoying this game! I've been programming for nearly 40 years and have some experience with JavaScript but the week that I've spent with this game has made me much more confident in the language.
631,2471,"For the time being, this is the only game in my library that matters."
632,2471,Excellent game really! Quite different from anything I have ever played. Its like having your own little ant/borg farm where you are god of your little ppl. I am very limited so far as I'm merely learning JS but have been able to make it work (slowly and not terribly efficiently) but its been GREAT FUN learning as I go. Thanks for the amazing game!
633,2471,"I am a teacher and I use this game to help students understand the basics of conditional logic, variables, classes, loops and functions. It is a fun way to dive into programming."
634,2470,"I've never previously wrote a review for a game and I'm glad it is Screeps that pops that cherry.Screeps is one of those games that comes around once in a blue moon and I'm glad I found it. The whole experience while playing has been enjoyable.Like a lot of people I assume, I saw Screeps and thought it would be a fun way into learning JavaScript. I'm so glad I did as I have learnt a lot in the past 67 hours and have been able to apply some of it to my everyday job too which is a bonus. The other side to that is that none of it felt like ""work"". If you're remotely interested in how things work behind the scenes in games, this is for you. If you like to solve problems, this is for you. If you like the idea of pitting your mind against someone else's, this is for you. Admittedly, I don't play on the main server so have yet to be fully tested as I play on a private server with 4 work mates and that is our competition. We've found that Screeps spills over into the workplace now and lunch times are filled with strategy talks and discussions on ""how do you do that bit?"" or ""how do you handle this scenario?"" Definitely a good game and would 100% recommend to anyone even remotely into any sort of coding. FYI, if you're a complete beginner, there are YouTube guides to get you going and you can just tinker as you go along."
635,2470,"This game brings about an awesome concept forcing the player to develop real AI programming skills. Compared to a traditional RTS, strategy creates success vs speed and quick thinking. Love this game!"
636,2470,"The game seems interesting and really quite fun, however...I've never been able to play past the tutorial for just one simple reason.When it comes to learning programming, I am actually mentally handicapped. I have absolutely NO brainspace for it and worst of all, trying to learn frustrates me beyond any measure, as nothing ever sticks.Always willing to humor my friends in listenning to them talk programming, but yeah.Even if I had the world's greatest guide to Javascript and how to understand literally everything in it (A guide I'm sure doesn't even exist, atleast not yet), I'd still fail to learn it.To play this, I need ""How to Code in Javascript For Houseplants""It's good though! I... Think."
637,2470,It like building the mechanics of the game just the way you like it. And then putting everybodies mechanics to war and finding out who has the least JavaScript bugs :D I love the idea and its extremley addictive.
638,2470,"Screeps, where do I even begin...?Firstly, for a game designed around the idea of autonomous AI micromanagement, it is incredibly addictive. You'll find yourself spending hours just trying to create the perfect AI for your creeps and structures; it gets seriously out of hand.Otherwise though, it's an amazing game if you enjoy programming. Through the fact that you are typically surrounded by competing players, you will always be finding new things that you can add to your code to become just a little bit more efficient. It's exciting and tense in a weird way.If you're a novice to programming, this game becomes a great way to improve your ability and get more experience; if you're more adept, you'll still find it a challenge that improves your skill. If you have no prior programming experience, I don't think this would be a good way to learn; most of the map - including the novice zones - is contested by other players with ready code, and they will not have mercy.Although it does not say so in the trailer, you don't need to use javascript to play this game. With a connected Github account you can use any language that compiles to javascript (such as python and ruby), though this will require some setting up.tl;dr great game if you like programming, but it steals your soul \_()_/"
639,2470,"It's like having an antfarm, but all the ants have OCD. Two thumbs up!"
640,2469,"I personally didn't know any JavaScript except for what I learned from CodeCademy when learning jQuery. But even though I wasn't any good at JS I still managed to setup a basic base of operations. So if you're looking to buy this game, don't worry if you don't know any JS, you can always look for some tutorials on YT."
641,2469,Best game ever for patient people.
642,2469,"Not often that I feel the need to review a game on steam, but this time I did. I'm proficient in JavaScript, I got off to a great start, enjoying the simulation experience. However: Once you join an online game, the tick rate was so absurdly low that It wasn't enjoyable, I'd of had to wait hours to experience anything else, as the starter screeps move so slowly that at 1 tick every 5 or so seconds, it would take a minute to traverse the grid and back with energy. I gave up with this game before I even got to see some of my code executed.Absurdly slow gameplay, littered with waiting and subscription p(l)aygates is something we expect to see in mobile games. Getting to code your AI is great, spending 1 minute watching them gather a tiny amount of resources... not so great.No thanks."
643,2469,"This is probably the most entralling programming game I've played. One of the main reasons for this is the delayed gratification of the turn based system meaning that the game runs constantly whether you're playing or not. I would, however, note, that unless you're an experienced programmer, the learning curve is steep. That's mitigated to some extent by the novice areas the developers provide, but you're still going to need a working knowledge of JS to get very far here."
644,2469,If you don't know any javascript before starting its easy to learn and fun to play.
645,2468,"If you like programming, ""tower-defense"", and persistant worlds this is the game for you. And the programming isn't as hard as one may think.The learning curve is high, but the ""native"" language is one of the most forgiving and easiest to learn: Javascript. In addition to the games own doc's i would recommend using additional resources such as W3Schools, which shows the bulk of what pure Javascript and CSS can do.When you solve one of your own programming errors or problems it feels more rewarding than in a traditional MMO.Great concept, great game. I'm only about a week into the game so far, but its all been great. Documentation is pretty good, could use a few more practical examples. But doing so might defeat the purpose of learning. And what they have for a tutorial really does gives you the most basic understanding of what is required to get a room up and going. The API Doc has all the objects in it with very good descriptions and in some cases example snippets demonstrating the particular property or function."
646,2468,"Last year in October I suffered a stroke resulting in partial paralysis in my left side. Since then gaming has been an exercise in frustration. If you can't reliably hit WASD with good timing, most games are a waste. A coworker introduced me to this game though, and it's quickly become my obsession. I don't need lightning-fast reflexes or extreme precision to excel; I simply write code that lets the game run itself and refine as I go along."

I even set it up with a custom IDE (and using browser for GUI, so my steam hours are quite inaccurate lol). Loving it. So much depth. My creeps are retarded right now, but they are my little ants and I will grow them to take over the world.Game has lots of depth. It is still under development and stuff could be improved (ie, the GUI on lower ends pcs gets like 10 fps, ouch. They did make a twitter announcement to switch to pixi.js / webGL which should help tremendously). Has some limitations I'd like for them to close in terms of code, but I can code around it np so whatever! There's also lots of resources available (tutorials, api, blogtorials), open source github AIs, and a very active slack. Overall though there is tons and tons of content already.Your programming ability far far far outweighs this CPU thing. Don't worry about it (I did). Also there's a market place anyway, but that's more end of game. Also seems the more levels you gain (which are tied to achievements per life, and permenant on your account) the more your CPU limit increases (up to 300 max)."

652,2466,"What a great addictive game. My knowledge of scripting is basic and Ive been wiped once already but its a great game. Spend hours upon hours trying to get things working just how you want then another hour looking for the typo.

653,2466,"Great game if you know just a tiny bit about Javascript and want to know more.I really love Screeps. It's fun, interesting, and sometimes pretty tense.The real-time-strategy is very slow paste, but that's okay. In case you need to change some code during the action, that just makes things less stressful.That being said, nothing in this game works without the player (or players) writing code for it.This might be a turnoff for everyone who is not a programmer, but listen to me: The basics of Javascript are easily learned, and you can build off of that. You will know how to write working Screeps code in no time.Personally, I knew some Java beforehand, but nothing about Javascript. In about one week I had a thriving colony nevertheless. And I keep learning more about Javascript. It's great.I like the UI of Screeps, it's simple, it works. The only thing that I'm not too fond of, is that the official servers are really laggy. There are so many players, and the servers have to run everyone's code... That makes the flow of the game slow down to a crawl.I mostly play on a local server, and invite a couple of friends.All in all a great, fun, and interesting game, if you are willing to learn some Javascript!"
654,2465,"Nice game, quite fun to program and not that hard with the tutorial to get a basic grasp on how to do things.Not been in the game that long, but allready I can see the more advanced behaviours appear within my creeps.Still a bit early at this moment to write my review, but am liking the game, check on my areas once or twice per day, fix or add something to some scripts, monitor then see what a new day brings."
655,2465,"This game is great, the community are mature and friendly, and the game itself is engaging and fun, which regular updates and good balancing.

656,2465,"Interesting Concept, horrid Execution.Spent 2-3 hours comming up with code in simulation that I could use for the actual world, only to find that the world is slow as .

665,2463,"6/10Fun game for programmers, completely not for non-programmers. If you really dive into this game, you'll need a pretty expensive subscription later on, which is one of the major downsides of this game.Essentially this is a real-time-strategy game, except that you program all your units entirely and have no other way to control them. There are no limited rounds or anything, you just fight till you get destroyed, then you respawn somewhere else, start from scratch, rinse repeat. Essentially a fight of who is the best programmer.The graphics are the bare minimum you need to see what's going on, and could definitely use some improvements. The integrated IDE (Atom) works, but you can also use your preferred one instead. Which is about all you can say about this game aside from the programming aspect.Scripting itself is done in JavaScript, which is not the best choice for such a game, as it is inherently slow, yet execution speed is one of the resources you need to manage. The server itself is also written in JavaScript, which reduces the tick time to something around 2.5 seconds on the official server. Good thing this game is simulated even while you are offline, as it can take days at this crawling speed to get things done.The API is ok-ish and works for the task, but could use some polishing and additional functionalities. One of the bad things is that you are forced to divide your code into functionality and persistent storage, which makes a lot of code constructs impossible or very difficult. And then re-initializing your structures every game tick from memory eats a good portion of your limited execution time. This should definitely be improved.Aside from the flaws this game is however surprisingly fun. The concept is simple enough to to start immediately, yet leaves enough ""secrets"" for you to discover. Every time you have your new version of your world-dominating script online, you find new ways of approaching things. Also as you improve your code, so do the others, which makes it unlikely that someone will ever ""finish"" this game."

667,2463,Screeps is a very challenging game suited to programmers. It will constantly test and retest your skills.
668,2463,"Anytime you code anything, you improve as a programmer.Screeps is not only a fun game, it's a smart investment."
669,2462,"This game is definitely a challenge even for programmers who have programmed professionally for years. While it's a programming game, I have never programmed in Javascript before and had no trouble picking it up. The game is about strategy and learning to make programs to satisfy those strategies is not too hard, even for a newbie Javascript programmer."
670,2462,"I understood the tutorials, the docs are great, and I think it's an amazing concept, but I really would like a mode where I can just play a quick(ish) game that's stored locally to my machince or something so I can just play around with it. Not the simulated room, but maybe a world with 4 - 16 rooms. This feels a bit too much like the tribal wars type games too with the alliances and massively established player bases, that it really doesn't do much to draw in a new player and make them want to stick around.Having said that they have a pretty well established reddit and the  3 game devs are great. I will most likely get this game again in the future, but for now I don't feel I would really enjoy playing it. Also, no sound effects or music. Regardless of what type of game it is it's still a game, so some cool UX features would be nice. Even if I had to code it in myself haha.Potential buyer: If you know don't know JavaScript and don't understand what objects and methods are then you should take some free tutorials on codecademy.com first before you buy this. Those tutorials can take up to 60 hours, but they teach you practical, real-world knowledge. The game's tutorials will take about 1-2, and the game's tutorials will  assume you understand what you're doing when writing the code and will not teach you how to code or explain the code you're writing except in as far as how it impacts the game.I would also recommend you check out the screeps website and play through the tutorials before you purchase it. If you get through it and still want more, then buy it. Lastly, learning programming can be challenging and you would be suprised how many experienced professional devs have to look things up daily. Learning how to learn and get past a challenge is one of the main skills a good dev has, and if you give up easily, then you'll find it very hard to get gud at programming.tldr; great execution on the concept, but design choice is not for me. If you're new to programming read up on JavaScript and OOP- specifically methods. Try free version on screeps website first, then buy."

675,2461,"Should have reviewed this a while ago. Much fun, plenty to do, will never go bored. Great for co-op if you build in adjacent rooms.  Definately a learning curve to Javascript. But the more time you spend with the game, the more you can do. There's nothing wrong with starting basic and getting a creep to move energy. 9/10"
676,2461,"If you like coding, this is a game for you. If you love coding, this is not a game for you.The memory system is eh. It might be realistic in the games sense that you only can store information in entities but I just can't play this like it is now.I reconsidered. It just sucked me in again and made me work around the problems the game gave me."
677,2461,"This is one of my favorite games. Not only is it great to use as a tool to learn java script syntax but, its great to play with friends. I and a few friends baught the game around the same time and have a little alliance going. I would recommend this game to anyone. Whether you are a java script master or, just finished taking the codecademy course for the language. Happy programming!"
678,2461,effen love it!improve your codeimprove your self
679,2461,"This game is great if you enjoy programming! You can make it as challenging as you want. The tutorial code is enough to make your colony survive, but if you want to become more effecient, expand, attack other people, or defend your colony more effectively you must come up with better code to do these things! If you don't know the slightest thing about programming this might not be a game for you. It doesn't teach you the basics of programming but its great practice for someone with an intermediate knowledge base. Fine for beginners if you're willing to put in outside work to learn about programming first. Overall 8.5/10. Few things I would change but dev's have done excellent job with the game and could always use more players!"

682,2461,very slow paced.

You're really better off playing a better game, or coding something, rather than trying to combine the two.EDIT: Like bcbc2425 in the comments pointed out, another major issue with this game is that you pay for it, and then it's still a pay to win game. That really did miff me quite a bit."
684,2460,Do you feel your games are lacking in depth and sense of accomplishment?  Do you have an intrest in programing?  Welcome home!
685,2460,"This game is perfect for those who enjoy games and programming and want to learn javascript with realtime practice.  I have faded knowledge of c++ and have dabbled in many languages such as python, php, javascript, perl and so fourth, never realy making anything usefull with them and definately never stuck with any of these languages long enough to say I know them but I am no stranger to programming subjects.  Ive partialy read many books on the subject but never had the drive to use the language long enough to gain real experience.  Now that I am changing careers to a full stack web developer I have to know javascript and this game has given me the hands on practice while making me crave more.Unlike other games that feature programming this one uses a real world programming language.  The documentation covers everything and the getting started tutorials were not boring like other games are.  The ingame code editor leaves many things to be desired while being enough for most people to get the job done, you can use your own editor or Ide such as sublime, atom and more.  I do not regret paying $17 for this game and will purchase a subscription when my 30 days is up.  I generaly hate games that have subscription systems but this one is different, you don't have to subscribe to play and if you subscribe to increase your CPU limit I belive this to be a very fair trade because servers are expensive to run and maintain.  Also by subscribing you are funding a game you belive in, and the developers.  If you look at the screeps source code you will apreciate the skill and time that these programmers have invested to make this awesome game.Cons:  If you use your own editor / ide it seems the game periodicaly prompts you to replace your local script, as if somehow the code you write is not always being synced to the cloud.As of right now you are limited in naming your creeps, you either have to supply a name at creation or let the game pick but It would be nice to have more options, such as being able to change their name later, or supply a prefix argument or even format rule that the game will use to name your creep.  I can live with it though.You will spend more time playing this game than you should and that can cause problems for you if your not careful.Pros:Well documented/ supportedeasy to get started, lots of githubs and other users sharing code and even video tutorials,cross platform (windows, linux, mac),you will feel better about yourself."
686,2460,"As a programmer and a gamer I'm currently hyper addicted to this game.  I was hesitant about buying it because I was worried it would feel too much like work.  Delightfully, it doesn't at all.  It feels like I'm in the honeymoon phase of writing a game where the engine and all the assets are done and I can now happily tinker away at AI for the game.  There is a very light touch of Eve Online in this game, where every player shares the same world, there's a market, and a real sense of distance and scale.  There is offline progress, and the excitement of getting up the next morning to see how your creeps did overnight.  There is ""city management"", optimizing how resources flow through your base(s).  Creeps are born, they die, and there is a constant need for resources to maintain a lively base.  There are occasionally NPC raids to keep things interesting, but they stay in one room and if you're not prepared for them, don't worry, they die from old age and you can start anew.  In this game, progress is your code, and your global level.  Your base is just a means to those goals, and if you happen to get wiped out (I haven't yet), you keep both your code (so you can start up a new base quickly and efficiently with minimal intervention) and your global level (which determines how many rooms you can claim and how much cpu you can use).  A fair review lists cons as well, and I can only think of two.  (1) There is an awesome feature which lets you replay the history of a room (so you can watch the entire night's goings-on at fast-forward pace if you want to) but there are unfortunately numerous gaps in the history due to bugs.  And (2) the MMO world ticks at a slower rate (once every 2.5 seconds or so) than private servers can (once per second, or even faster with caveats).  This is because there are so many players being processed simultaneously, even while offline.Overall, I'm hooked.  Great game."
687,2460,"This is one of the most fun and awesome games i have played.  However, this is only true if programming and AI are of interest to you.This is like the MIT Battlecode tournaments but on a bigger scale.  The possibilities you have in this game are huge!  The tutorial is very good and if you know any programming language, after finishing the tutorial, you should be able to pick up and modify the tutorial code and get something working on the official servers quickly.If you have no interest in programming or AI, then this game is not for you :)But if it is your cup of tea, then be prepared to have your mind constantly thinking up new ways to automate your code for world domination."

693,2459,"Disclaimer: I only had very basic Python knowledge when I bought this.This game is a perfect example of something that is really hard (for a Javascript noob like me), but then rewards you with that special feeling when something DOES work out. I'm learning by back-engineering other people's scripts but slowly start to try my own things. I'm a huge fan of sandbox games, and this is about as sandbox as it gets. I'm not sure I would recommend this to someone without programming knowledge...but the game can be a great motivator for those wanting to learn.If you like Kerbal Space Program, Factorio, RimWorld and CitiesSkylines...you might like this too if you even have the slightest interest in programming. Steep learning curve though ;)"
694,2458,"Almost got a refund after the tutorial since I wasn't if it would be worth the $17 CAD. I found the copy/paste style tutorial taught me everything I needed to know and where to look for more help, but it wasn't until I had spent a hour or two actually playing the game before I got hooked.The progression of the game is excellent and I think that's what makes it super addictive. You start with super simple tasks such as mining or spawning more creeps, then you slowly add features like dedicated harvesters, haulers, etc. Each feature building upon the last either adding functionality or more efficiency. The game is extremely deep and the number of things you can do (and the ways to do it) is huge. Despite this each task is simple and quite easily tackled (in theory, you could spend days making it 'perfect' :p). My only wish was that it explained a gave more information/tips for how you should select your starting room (other than at least two energy sources), something like pick sources that are closer to your room controller to make your RCL/GCL increase faster in the early game.Still not sure if I'll be buying a CPU subscription since I'm still 23 days away and the private servers seem a lot more appealing to me (set the tick time to .5 seconds instead of the 2.5s on the main server)[As a note I do have several years of programming experience in half a dozen languages (but not javascript). I found the documentation/APIs to be pretty good and the website's has pretty much everything you need to know/want to know (although the search feature doesn't always bring up relevant results)]"
695,2458,I love this game.  So much fun and addicting.   I liked it so much I bought a copy for my friend.  I highly recommend this game if you like scripting.
696,2458,Awesome just awesome
697,2458,(Placeholder)
698,2457,"You don't have to pay the subscription. You get 10 cpu for free (not very much) on the public server. You can also play on a private server, which isn't too hard to set up."
699,2456,"Great Game, especially for pragammer. However, this will take lots of time and vigor."
700,2456,"This game presents a pretty nice programming challenge. If you want to know what programming is like, you get all the facets here:* quickly hacking around* reading up on documentation how stuff works exactly* rethinking the decisions you made a while ago* iterating on your implementation, improving it regularlyWhat I really like about it: From the programming side there is no artificial barrier, but all the challenge is real programming. The most arbitrary barrier is the CPU limit. But it is of course neccessary, since you could also spend hours on calculating your move for the next tick otherwise. The CPU limit is what makes you think about efficiency after all.You should play screeps if:* ... you like playing computer games, but are undecided if you should go for a degree in computer science* ... you like playing computer games and you know that you want to go for a degree in computer science* ... you like programming* ... you are not sure if you like programmingYou shouldn't play screeps if:* ... you are not into programming"
701,2456,"The concept is cool and I was very excited to try it out, but it doesn't seem very playable.  I don't know if it was a problem with the tutorial code or if their servers are just bad, but the game seems unplayable. I copied the source code from the tutorial and my creeps wouldn't move at all.  They would sometimes do things after I made modifications to my code, but for long periods of time they would just stop moving entirely.  The tutorial code doesn't work and the methods on their website are not documented that well, so I wasn't comfortable modifying them to test things out.  The game did not behave consistently, as sometimes my creeps would move and sometimes they would freeze for long periods of time.I gave this game about 4 hours of my time and couldn't even get the basics done on their servers after doing the tutorial.  Everything worked fine in the tutorial, but using the exact same code on their servers produced very inconsistent results.  I bought the game after seeing the good reviews, but would hesitate to recommend it to anyone."
702,2456,"Neat game. Worth full price, as the developers really came up with a good original concept here.It would be nice if you could activate your month subscription at a later date, because it takes a long time to learn the API and create your initial modules.If you know JavaScript, then great, you can dive right in.If you don't, you will have to spend considarable time learning in order to play this."
703,2456,"An Incredible Idea, a truly dynamic and interesting experience. If you can program in java script then this game would be interesting. Suggestion to Devs: IMPROVE DOCUMENTATION, moving to new rooms is difficult to understand given how there is no information on how your creep will get randomly stuck in the void between rooms."
704,2456,"Very cool game concept and well executed. If you have never done programming before it is a good way to learn, and if you have then you'll be right at home. There are a lot of people online playing surprisingly -- I thought it would be pretty much empty. There's a lot to the game that you can use once you get into it like trading resources with other players automatically under conditions that you have to figure out.I like that it's so open ended and that optimization is necessary in order to keep your CPU cycles down. Seriously recommended if you enjoy programming or want to learn JavaScript."
705,2456,"Excellent game. Time goes fast while playing this game. Would recommend to everyone who likes programming. If you do not like programming, this game is not for you."
706,2456,"One of the more novel ideas I have ever seen.Absolutely everything you can do in this game, you have to program yourself. In order to even get started you have to program some rudimentary AI into your creeps, and the tutorial helps massively with this. From there though, everything you want to do you have to figure out, and script. If you notice a few juicy energy nodes in a neighboring room, you have to alter your creeps to be able to find that room, those nodes, and go over and mine it and come back. If someone attacks you, and you don't have any scripts to fight back or run, you get to start over brand new in a new room!Your scripts persist between each room, and your global account level persists as well, letting you get a quick jump back up to where you were.I've been absolutely hooked on this game for the past week or so. I'll be up into the very wee hours of the morning, yelling at my tiny creeps wondering why my code isn't working, and fixing and refactoring it until they do.Amazing game."
707,2455,"Very fun game if you like to build things. Great if you're looking to sharpen your Javascript knowledge and it has great documentation for the API. Awesome community particularly on the Screeps Slack channel. I couldn't really recommend this if you're new to programming - you'll want a basic knowledge of variables, arrays, loops and organising code into modules, but you can learn these to a required level pretty quickly on something like Codecademy."
708,2455,"This is a game that takes a new spin on the old style strategy games before it, and successfully created something wonderful and new.  I will say this game is targeted for a specific niche, so if you don't like programming and strategy games then move on. But if you enjoy programming, strategy and problem solving then look no further.Happy Hacking."
709,2455,"I must say this is a great game. Its not just about building you colony and having small problems like your running out of resources but, you have to code and find ways to be efficient. You need to really think ""What will this do?"" and ""How can I make my creep move there when there is nothing to do?"". It is a really fun challenge and a great was to learn basic java script. Also you will never run out of things to do because there are other players you can trade with or fight with. If your goal is to get the highest score on the leaderboard then other players might be a issue forcing you to make new code to kill them or to trade to become more powerful. Another great feature is that all you need to play this is internet access and your good to go. I bought the game on my PC which has an issue where in I unplug it it powers off and will not power off so, I like to play it on my CromeBook. The point is that I think you should buy this game and enjoy your self ....... unless you hate coding."
710,2455,"Q: Do you need to know how to code?A: Yes. You need basic level javascript skills (or something similar enough), so you can learn more by playing.Sure this game is not for everyone (consider this as warning too), but for me it's already been worth buying many times over.Good...+ Coding & learning, it's pretty much everything in this game+ ES6 support. Makes javascript almost fine+ Forces you to think and learn new tricks+ You can easily use huge amount of hours to this one and notice it can be fun and educatingBad...- Javascript ... I really don't like javascript- In game editor and console could be much much better- There is no way to add any UI functionality. Not even buttons to run your functions.- Documentation lacks many things, you need to test to find out how it really works.- Some bugsDepends...* Official server tick is around 4 seconds, you don't see much fast action, but you have more time to respond..."
711,2455,Who knew Java Script could be so much fun?  What a great way to get introduced to JS.  Hours spent watching my creeps.  Love this game.
712,2455,"AWESOME GAME!I really like the idea, that you write your own code to play the game."
713,2455,"Freeking amazing.If you been coding since you learned to walk like me.You gonna love it.If you dont know codez yet, but are fascinated by it and peering over the edge in wonder... JUMP. (one of us, welcome aboard, yes thats how we all got here)If you think computers are boring and code is scary. I hate you."
714,2454,"If you're a programmer and love, or hate, java than this game is a no brainer."
715,2454,"This game is great for anyone who is newer to programming, to grizzled veterans. I have found a lot of fun in coming up with interesting systems for managing my colony. Hope to see more people join the fray!"
716,2454,Great Game for anyone who wants to start learning how to write code or anyone who used to but needs a refresher. You get to see how your code operates right away! I really reccomend this game
717,2454,"Screeps is an unique and amazing game all rolled into one. It has the strategy/conquer aspects of RISK or some other game of the like, it also creates an environment that is great for learning JavaScript or just programming in general. It starts basically enough, discover how to create creeps to do your bidding, harvest energy, spawn more creeps.. but as you go along the required logic to automate your empire increases. All in all it's an amazing game with a steady learning curve and some great challenges.One caveat that I'll warn you about. Because Screeps is a uniquely persistent game (your creeps do your bidding even when you're away for a day if you've scripted them properly) the developers rely on a subscription model. But the nice thing about it is that it is discounted for large purchases of time. At six months it only costs 6.95 a month which is less than a streaming service. If a subscription based model puts you off of a game, think of it this way: In screeps, your presence is always online by the scripts you write to automate your empire. So in many ways, it's like hosting a small webpage. It needs resources to work even when you're not managing the server.Aside from that, if you want a great way to learn to program or learn JavaScript, I'd highly recommend screeps!"
718,2454,"So you want to be a programmer? Screeps is just a really entertaining game. The basic concept is you use javascript to code for the creation, management, and replacement of your creeps. They die over-time so you have to have some code in place to automate that function as the game continues to run whether you are there or not. I started the game with no knowledge of javascript programming. In fact, the only programming experience I had was all done in Visual Basic back in High School. I started up the game anyway, did the tutorial, and got the basic idea. I played around with the tutorial scripts that the game provides and was easily able to understand how some of the syntax works. From there, I went and did some free javascipt tutorials online (freecodecamp).   I am slowly progressing now and still encountering some difficulties as my knowledge of programming expands. This game has a massive learning curve. As I write this I am still only in one room building roads, harvesting energy, and repairing my structures. The idea of expanding into another room and ferrying resources around, opening a chem lab, and so forth all within autmoated code is daunting! But - I am enjoying learning the programming language and enjoying the challenge. Overall, if you are looking for a game to challenge you to learn a new skill and you are willing to do some self-education and learning, than this is an excellent opportunity to learn javascipt in a fun way."
719,2454,I really like the idea and also the realization of this game. I really looking forward to get some free time to get again into this game :)
720,2454,"very very good game, but game tick time is some how long, and the total player is now just 2500"
721,2454,"So I discovered you can have a secret Screeps addicition by getting in on Steam then using a browser to play it, this way it only clocks a few of the actual play hours you do! :)Having played this at work, home, parents, social events and various other places from both PC, Laptop, Phone (not overly recommneded but is possible) I can say that as a want-to-be programmer this not only solves that ""itch"" but also provided a very excellent learning ground branching from C# CLR in to JavaScript and thus in to ""front end"" development.Loving every moment of it, even those points where it all goes wrong and that one typo causes every creep to stop, point and laugh before expiring through lack of co-oporation of buggy code!"
722,2454,Fantastic javascript fun! This is really legit and a great fun way to get into some real javascript.
723,2453,"High learning curve of course :)I mostly code in C# so had to learn javascript. Still getting used to it, but it is challenging and fun.11/10 === Fun way to learn a new coding language"
724,2453,"This is an amazing game that has had me hooked from the second i picked it up. I write JavaScript daily so the learning curve for me was non-existant. It's good for medium, to, advanced JavaScript programmers. You can also cross compile to JavaScript (node.js) using your language of choice if it supports it. It has a strong community, and solid architecture."

726,2453,Incredibly amazing game for programmers.
727,2453,"Best.. game.. ever. If you like programming I mean. And even if you don't know if you like programming this can be a good game. Community is awesome and there are already YouTube instructions on how to get started (thPionGaming). So far I have enjoyed this game a lot. It improves my programming skills and it is fun.+ Improves something that can be really usefull in real life (programming skills)+ Tons of fun+ You don't need to play all the time to be good. You can improve by babysteps if you wish, or spend nights (or days) programming+ Community+ You don't actually need to buy that subscription at start or even after 30 days. My current cpu use is around 7 and I just got to level 2 which gives me ten more. So currently 7/20 cpu used.- Hmmh, addictive?If not sure about buying this game you can ask questions on screeps slack channel. :)"
728,2453,"Screeps is a very interesting concept game that I definitely would want to see expanded. This game, as far as I know, is the only one of its kind. You play by coding little workers to execute tasks and create bases. Creating the AI that controls your units in real time has never been easier or more necessary. Screeps is a great way to learn JavaScript if you have experience coding in the past, however, I would not recommend that you purchase Screeps without basic programming knowledge. The game itself plays smoothly except for occasional lag when viewing the world map and other players' rooms. The tick speed is a little on the low side which slows things down a bit and the graphics are meh. Selling a CPU subscription makes sense, but limiting players to 10 CPU without buying it is a bit of a cash grab (30 CPU default would be fine). Other than that, there are few things that need improvement. Screeps is very fun to play after you read up on the documentation; I currently have 8 hours on Screeps but most likely I have another 16 or so from programming in Microsoft Visual Studio.Enjoyment - 95/100Replayability - 100/100Community - 100/100Graphics - 50/100Pricing - 75/100Developers - 70/100FInished Product - 100/100Grand Total - 84/100"
729,2453,"Having little programming experience, and no Javascript skills, I became interested in Screeps when after witnessing a coworker describe his AI like an organism. I subscribed next day. The tutorial walks through basic ideas and like a neophyte graduate I walked into the real world face flat. The learning curve is steep. Tens of hours spent pouring over documentation to understand why a transfering to container is different than a spawn. Day by day my code base increases. Eventually I could wake up in the morning, and find my colony has not died because it lacked the energy to spawn harvesters. Success! Empire expansion follows. Pushing the boundary beyond one room leads to new problems which MUST be solved. After pushing out the poor users who abandoned their colonies, I encountered my first true adversary. After probing his defenses, I logged in one day to see an ARMY invading my outer borders. Frantic coding ensued, I stopped the invaders at the gate. Multiple battles ensued. Strategy built on the fly, tactics developed on necessity. My adversary probed my weaknesses and I fought back reclaiming rooms as fast as he could take them. Unfortunately, one morning I woke up to find all my spawns destroyed. The enemy broke destroyed one room, causing my script to error and leave my empire defenseless. I watched the replay helplessly as he waltzed in and destroyed my empire without resistance. I cannot wait to rebuild and strike back."
730,2453,"Great game. It's a fun programming challenge, and they don't dumb it down for you."
731,2452,"There is not a better way to learn a new computer language, and Screeps is far more entertaining than I expected it would be."
732,2452,"... i hate it.I never hated something more.*shivers*... it's too addictive xD... Way to much fun to stick your nose into code.AND way to good.q,q devil of an game.--After alot of respawns i finally conquered myself an place in that world.I would suggest everyone to play screeps. That is able to logicaly think and has time to learn.The community on slack is helpfull and friendly.Ingame you will spawn in an newbie zone... but don't misjudge it!NEWBIE ZONES ARE DEATHMATCHES!Either you kill them or they kill you.(or you politicaly agree on an NAP ... which will just be the prep time for murder and massacer.The energy sources are limited.CPU is limited.Rooms are limited.Guess what, everyone wants your room probably. And already is planning to overtake you.Suit up.Code up.And go to war!!"
733,2452,"Its a great game, and I started as a novice to programming. I always found it very fun either way, whenever I accomplished a simple task I would get an immense feeling of self gratification to see those little workers move how I wanted them too. I found myself playing very intensely for a couple weeks then leaving the game for a couple months, then coming back and leaving again, but each time more knowledgeable than the last. At first my code was heavily heavily influenced by thPion's code, but now I'm pretty self sufficient and competent at programming in general, at least for now.I find that you would only need to buy CPU when you're establishing yourself in 3+ rooms; I was well of for most of the time with my 20 CPU as long as I didn't craft some heinous piece of code.Tl;DR Fun game, even to a novice programmer"
734,2452,WHAT THE **** ARE MY BOTS DOING?10/10 Really good game and good for learning to program!
735,2452,"This game is amazing. I found it accidently while browsing the steam store. At first it looked like nothing. A game where you program creeps (more like ants) to collect resources and build stuff for you. I was wrong.It turned out to be an MMO with a world full of players, all of which are programmers from all walks of life.When I first tried the live demo, my Javascript skills were extremely rusty. Last time I did any real JS work was back in college. I found myself googling lots of JS-related ""how to"" and after a couple of hours I finally had a working AI that could build and use harvesters. At this point I bought the game and never looked back since. If you want to start learning Javascript and need a fun way to do it, or want see how your skills hold up against other programmers, you'll like (maybe love) Screeps. Literally everything in the game can be controlled via your Javascript AI. Construction, resource-gathering, defense, attacking, trading, alliances. You name it, your AI can control it. The tick-rate on the MMO side of the game isn't crazy-fast, but that shouldn't be a problem if you're not sitting there watching time slowly pass by, because that isn't what this game is about. It's about making an AI that can pretty much play the game for you and beat other people's AI. But if you really want a faster tick rate, you're also able to host your own private server and configure numerous options, including the tick-rate.The game is newb-friendly. You'll be given the option to spawn in ""novice"" rooms, which likely have other newbies nearby, as well as receive a safe-mode each time you (re)spawn, which protects you for a short time against attackers.Death/losing is another thing the developers managed to get right. Getting beaten by another person's AI feels more like a learning experience instead of an annoyance. Each death reveals a weakness in your AI that you can work to improve over time. Every room in the game records its history, which you can replay to see what went down while you were away.11/10 - Probably the best accident I've participated in. Also the must fun I've had re-learning a programming/scripting language. :)EDIT 02/02/2017 - Having been around for more than a month now I can truthfully tell you, the developer really does support this game to the best of their ability. Despite not being early-access, there are some pretty big things on the way.If you're wondering why my play time is only 12 hours, its because I mostly play via a browser. You can literally play Screeps anywhere."
736,2452,"Been 'playing' off and on for a few months.What that means is I occasionally come in to check on things and update code.The more you're able to expand, the more you have to learn to maintain the stability of your 'colony.'I like to think of this as a programming lesson in programming your own ant colony...Excellent teaching game for javascript!"
737,2452,"Even a novice programmer can have fun with a Screeps 10 CPU account.If you want to learn something, if you are a passionate developer, or if you are a competitive smart person Screeps has great depth and pacing.It's like an MMO you can walk away from and keep making progress... except when they kill you. This is the first persistent MMORTS to capture my attention since Time of Defiance."
738,2452,"I'd highly recommend it to get a general idea of what some coding is like, while at the same time packaging it as a game"
739,2452,"I love this game, although I would prefer not having to pay for your cpu on the steam version of the game."
740,2452,"Can't stop playing, send help."
741,2452,"Okay, so I am a Javascript dev at work, at home, pretty much constantly. However, I'm reasonably new to this profession and all I can say is this is a freaking awesome game, lots of fun and lots to learn at the same time.Keeps the skills sharp! Even on downtime!Just get it."
742,2452,Fantastic game!
743,2452,Started with very limited knowledge of programing. Had no idea I would end up sinking nearly 180 hours within the first couple of weeks of buying the game. 10/10
744,2452,"I really really really really like this game. I've played it on and off touching up my code for about two months now and I love it. I used to write bots for league and eve online and stuff, and I genuinely enjoyed coding and debugging and automating more than I did playing the game itself. I'm so glad I've found a game where I can script! It's easy to learn to interact with the game world via javascript, and the rest is just trial and error and checking the screeps api page :D! If you want to learn coding, or enjoy it, I highly recommend this game."
745,2452,Awesome game! Instantly hooked.Must be a programmer to be able to play this game.
746,2452,"This is it. All those pseudo coding battle tank / robot games WISH they were Screeps. The best way I can think of to describe this game, would be to take the oldschool Warcraft, keep core game mechanics and rules, and strip away all entity logic, which is where you come in to create it. 99% of the game is Javascript, with 1% being driven via the UI (though anything done via the UI can be automated as well). -Unlike another recent Javascript-centric game (Hackmud), there are no limitations here. If it is valid Javascript, it is useable.-Don't like the Steam or web clients? Roll your own using the API with the dev's blessingsI'm not really a fan of the subscription thing.. but after the trial month I will likely mostly stick to playing on a private server anyhow.. Though who knows, I may get sucked into a subscription off and on.The biggest challenge so far [at least for me] is making everything work under varying scenarios. As your AI code evolves and your colony grows, often code written tends to have quirks that don't work out so well and needs tweaking for example after being wiped out by an attack and starting back with 0 creeps again.Coming into this game without any prior coding knowledge could be rough, but definitely doable if you have the motivation to learn it.All in all, if you're a developer, this game is porn. 'Nuff said."
747,2452,"i realy like this game,this game won't teach you how to program, you need to come with the basics already,but if you are into programming this game will let you test your programming skills against other people.and i don't need o tell you the satisfaction you get when something realy complex you wrote is just working prefecly and all the creeps are doing what they should."
748,2451,Great game. Steam support and subcription sucks balls though so I'd advise to buy it on their website instead.
749,2451,"I have a programming background.  I had mostly done trivial things with Javascript.  For me the toughest part of learning a new language has been finding something you want to do in the new language.  So I wrote my first iteration in javascript.  Then my next iteration in Typescript.  I'm considering doing a 3rd iteration in closure-script.So you won't need to be familiar with any of these to get something working, but for me I got some good exposure to:NodeJs, Visual Studio Code, Typescript, Javascript, lodash, and probably some others that I am forgetting."
750,2451,"This is a great game for programmers, there is a learning curve of course, but when you get going it's not bad. I kinda like how it enforces optimization of code with cpu usage but I also don't like it because it also allows for people to pay to be able to have bad code. It also seems like it would be very hard to make it by without it anyways so it could be looked at as a subscription."
751,2451,"This game is awsome, still in the first 30 day period but the possibities are endless as long as you're willing to infest a few hours coding to make your thoughts become reality. High geek allert, but if you like coding this is a game for you..."
752,2451,"Screeps is an MMO where one uses their programming ability to solve problems ranging from simple to very complex. The game is slow paced, with each 'tick' of the world occurring every 3-5 seconds. The javascript code you write stays active 24/7, so finding and eradicating bugs early (and before you go to sleep) is a good idea!This game has held my attention for months, and my javascript knowledge has increased many-fold. It's a fun take on the MMO genre, where one can use logic problem solving skills and time to get a leg up from the other inhabitants of the world.Solid game, and would recommend to anyone interested in programming."
753,2451,"Sandbox, check.Open World, check.Massively Multiplayer, check.Scripting, check.Solve your problems however you want.  I code dirty, and nobody can stop me. You win some, you lose some. A lot of fun."
754,2451,Amazing game.
755,2451,"First of let me say I do NOT do many reviews. That said every now and then a game comes along that I just feel I should submit my opinion. This is one of those games.Wether you are and experienced with Java Script or not this game is a whole lot of fun wrapped in an easy to use package. You can use simple logic to experience all the game has to offer, and also put to use some of you deepest logic only for it to be more rewarding. I picked this up as I felt my Java Scripting could use some serious practice, but it has quickly become one of my favorites. I would recommend it for almost anyone. Especially for folks young and old that would like to learn how to code. It is a great and fun way to learn the logic. There is a great tutorial to get you started, and the resources/ help available for anything you can not figure out on your own is literally one click away.It is inexpensive, fun, educatinal, and entertaining with friends or alone. Highly recomended in my book. It is everything I have wished for in a game for a very long time. Give it a try at the site if your hesitent to spend the cash (there is a free demo at screeps.com), but I truly believe you will be happy with your purchase as I have been.One other note I feel I would like to share. I had ran into a small issue with the pop out in-game editor. As a typical human I became impatient as it seemed the issue had been discovered by others. It was dated like two days earlier for the record. Anyway in my impatience I added a note to the thread asking if any news was avaiable on the issue. To my very much pleasant surprise within ONE (from my post) day the issue was all gone without me lifting a finger. My point the folks behind this one truly DO give a sh*t abouy thier community, and we would be honored to have you among us. Get the game jump on the server you willl not be dissappointed, and I for one (and I'm certainly not alone) will be happy to help you through any trouble you have.Edit. Here it is almost a year down the road, and I still highly recommend this gaem. It is not for everyone, but of all the games I have played it is one of the few that teaches me something new each time I launch it."
756,2451,I am a first year computer science student and this game has really helped me to further my education. I am currently trying to get the word out about it amoungst our schools teaching staff as an alternat means of teaching. I think this game has a lot of potential for competitive play between computer science departments of universities.
757,2451,Great game if you know how to program. I am mainly a C# and C++ programmer but was able to pick up the Javascript fairly quickly. The programming is challenging enough to keep my interest.
758,2451,If you like RTS/Resource Management games and are either a programmer or interested in programming/automation then this game is for you!Write CodeGet DestroyedDestroy OthersGrow an Empire
759,2451,"I am definitely enjoying my time with screeps. I'm developing and reinforcing a habit of coding in my spare time (as little as I have) using this game which I will eventually use for other personal coding projects. I'm also getting additional practice of developing my own solutions to the rising complexity in the game as you make progress in individual rooms and at the global control level (which dictates how many rooms you can claim). This is a good counter-balance to the bug fixing that currently takes up a lot of my time at work. I have also learned more about Type 1 Hypervisors and creating Linux VMs because of this game due to setting up my own private server for my friends and I. Maybe some day it will be more active :)You'll get out of this game exactly what you want to get out of it and nothing more. If you aren't willing to take on an optional todo list in order to learn and practice a practical set of skills, then maybe this one isn't for you."
760,2451,I think this game is super cool and worth a lot of your time and worth your money but I don't think it should be a pay-per-month deal. Single-player works out fine and playing on dedicated servers is great!
761,2451,"This is an amazing game. You will spawn in. You will write some code, get your units to harvest some energy, and think you are awesome at this game. You will come back the next day and be dead. So you will respawn. And you will do it better this time. You will write some quality code, and plan strategically, and then you will imagine your empire in its full glory.Then you will hit the CPU cap. So you will refactor. Then you won't like your code anymore and think it is a mess. So you will rewrite everything from scratch. And you will enjoy every bit of it. (Well, most of it.)If you're not sure about buying this game because you don't know how to program, don't worry. Programming isn't hard. There are plenty of tutorials online, and once you get the basics of Javascript, the awesome community on the Slack channel will be glad to help you out.Happy coding!"
762,2451,"This game is a cool proof of concept, but there isnt enough here to ask for upfront payment as well as a subscription. Also the game being only in java script is also a bit of a bummer. If this game was free to play with a subscription i would reconsider, but im not going to pay for a very simple game, then pay again every month."
763,2450,subscription
764,2450,"When I first wrote my review, I was comparatively new to coding and object oriented design. I critisised the APIs because they were not what I was used to. I returned to this game 5 years later, to find that the objects and structures were actually quite good. I found that the documentation had been reworked and became easier to read and more descriptive, and I had learned how to read documentation properly in my lost 5 years. My last review was critical and in bad taste. I have grown to recognize that this game is actually quite good.I do want to note that this game is not great for beginners in coding. I had not encountered object structures like these until recently (and I promptly fell in love) when I found them in React and Pixijs. I apologize for my previous review, but I hope this sets it right."
765,2450,"Why is the subscription starting when you buy the game? I want to complete the tutorials first and test my AI in the simulator! Now I have lost more than one week of cpu subscription.But that's no problem because I am not going to play on the official servers because their tickrate is miserable...The documentation and guides are very minimalistic. You just have to guess/try things out.The client runs very bad on my 2 years old Thinkpad. It gets hot and drains the batery very fast. Isn't it just a website in a app?The ingame-IDE is very basic but does it's job. I have set up a project in IntelliJ, with autocomplete and grunt. But there is missing some kind of debug-bridge.I tried to setup a github-Repository for my scripts, because I love git, but WHY THE HELL DO YOU NEED ACCESS TO ALL MY REPOS?????Very good idea, bad implementation."
766,2450,MY SCREEPS NOW HAVE A THEME SONG!
767,2449,"It's a cool idea, and pretty fun, but, once you have a system that works you just have to sit there and wait for hours. then you place more things and wait longer. I got bored."
768,2448,This is the only MMO I've ever enjoyed.
769,2448,"At first, I did not feel like this game was worth the subscription price.Then I realized I couldn't stop playing.I literally cannot stop. It's very slow paced. I seriously can't stop. It's sucking up all my productivity for other activities.I've never encountered a more addicting game.The time spent playing is not accurate, as I actually play through the browser, and I write my code using Webstorm. (you can get it for free with a .edu email address)."
770,2448,"To call this a ""niche"" game would be understatement of the year.If you have ever fantasized about being on the winning side when Skynet takes over you may be within the target audience."
771,2448,"Not a bad game persay, but worth nowhere near the price and definitely not worth a subscription, even if you buy 6 months at a time for the cheapest subscription.Tick rate is too slow for the game to be exciting to watch like it is in the crazy sped-up promo videos, which are very misleading to how the game actually plays. Instead of the 10 moves a second you see in the videos, the official server runs at more like one tick every 4 seconds.In-game editor lacks syntax highlighting or warnings for simple things like missing a semicolon, meaning you'll want to also set up something like WebStorm to actually play properly.Debugging is hard because the game lacks breakpoints or even being able to log objects to the console and inspect them.If you like programming and watching paint dry, then this might be for you. I'd pick it up if it either didn't have the subscription or if it didn't have an upfront cost and was subscription only. If you like programming, just buy TIS-100 instead, it's programming but more fun, more polished and less than half the price.I wish I could get a refund, but I left it open while setting up webstorm and reading how to set up my own server to get any sort of decent tickrate and now I've got 3 hours. Edit: Steam gave me a refund"
772,2448,"[EDIT]Back in the game after a year. Re-Wrote half my code. They changed some things. Stuff runs smoother than ever. Now I'm a REAL scrub at coding, but damn, THIS IS FUN!!Also, bigger players  don't just stomp you here (Ever heard of ArcSurvival?). Yes, it is competitive, and you fight for rooms, resources and glory. But I have NEVER met anyone here who I couldn't talk to before starting a fight.Since it's hard - you write REAL Javascript, not some dumbed-down mockup language like other games - you ONLY find people here who are serious about the game. There is no equivalent to the campers in ego shooters here. ALL tutorials on the web where they could copy their code from eventually stop somewhere. That's where skill kicks in. That's where the bad apples get weeded out.I'm not saying people here are super 31337, what I'm saying is they're dedicated!Let me finish with a little anecdote:Just today I fixed a HUGE bug in my code! I had a nested loop where I didn't need one. That thing ate up ALL my CPU! Wanna hear the worst part? That bug was there for 5 days straight, but only started affecting me yesterday. And I think to myself  ""damn, I didn't change anything, what is going on?""The sense of accomplishment is GREAT when you fix such things, because you build your code to the BEST of your knowledge. And it STILL has mistakes in it! Everytime you find a bug, your knowledge expands, because your best now is better than your best before![/edit]It is November 2016. COD, Watchdogs 2, BF1 and Titanfall2 just came out.I PLAY THIS GAME. xD xDIt's better than Watchdogs 2!! There you have to press the 'F'-Key to 'Hack'. Here, you can use your whole keaboard to hack code together! It's amazing! It's a typical strategy game but you can't do ANYTHING with it..... unless you write javascript code that does it! How cool is that??Everything tha thappens is happening because you programmed it!If you don't know a little coding, don't waste your money.However, if you want to play the toughest, most complicated game on steam....I've fallen in love with this. Honestly. There's a CPU and Memory Limit. Coding alone isn't enough. You have to be efficient and optimize what you build. It is a STEEP learning curve, for sure. But man, if you spent 2-4 hours on a tiny bit of code, and it finally works... It's something truly beautiful.For anyone who likes to code and spend hours building something, this is a definite buy.But if you think you can just do a tutorial and start rocking, save your money.P.s. I realize i have almost no playtime on steam. That's because I play on their website screeps.com - they have a webversion which you can play everywhere. :)"
773,2448,This game is absoulty amazing. If you are a programmer.You will start small and step by step make your colony more efficient.I found it extreamly satisfying to solve these little problems you will notice in your colony.
774,2447,"Note: I am not associated with the developers in any way, I've just been playing a lot recently.Screeps is a game for programmers.But it is possible for someone without any previous programming experience to learn it with enough dedication, though I recommend at least learning some basics of programming/JavaScript from somewhere like codecademy first. And try the free tutorial before you buy the game (I am still running code that started out based on the tutorial code, 2 months later).The game has deceptively simple visuals, but a lot of increasingly complex systems that you gain access to as you progress within the game, providing interesting challenges for your programming ability. How complex it ends up getting depends in part on how much of it you end up wanting to automate. Pretty much anything you can do, you can get your code to do for you.Like most programming, you are going to want to look things up in the documentation, which covers all the different elements your code can interact with, and has examples for most functions.I also highly recommend joining the excellent and helpful community on the Slack chat.I recommend that new players spawn in the green novice areas around the edges of the map, so that any combat you get into is at least with someone of relatively similar power to you, instead of getting wiped out on a whim by an established player. You will want to get a tower and some defensive code up by the time your safe mode ends, and remember you can activate another safe mode from your controller if you have any available.Your main progression is your continued improvement of your code, most players respawn a few times.As for what I think of the game, I love it!This game has really reignited and fueled my passion for programming unlike anything before it.The learning curve may be a bit steep, but that is part of the fun/challenge.The community is great, and I spend a lot of time chatting on Slack and helping people with their questions and figuring out problems with their code. :) (helping people is optional of course, but I enjoy doing that)The developers are pretty responsive, and are continuing to improve the game, and fix issues that may be raised by the players.I find the subscription model fairly reasonable, and it is even possible to fund your subscription through your in game activities if you are reasonably good/developed. Though some choose to take on the additional optimization challenge of playing without a subscription and the additional limitations that gives.Buying the game on steam also gives access to private servers, which is an alternative/additional way to play the game, and is a good place to test your code before deploying it to the live server.Edit: A year later, I'm still really enjoying this game. It continues to get updates, and even some pull requests submitted by players get merged. Recently I have been enjoying implementing more complete automation in my code to participate in community-arranged bot arenas where players spawn into a small map with all interaction disabled except for the initial code upload, and the code has to do everything on its own and try to beat the other players' code at what ever the goal may be for the round. :D"
775,2447,If you are hesitant try the demo on the website. It made me buy it and I'm glad I did :)
776,2447,"Tickrate is way too low to observe anything significant happening in real time, so you log off for the day. You come back the next morning, and your colony is wiped out. Rinse and repeat until your code is robust enough to get you to the next doomsday scenario. Some people may find this fun but I can't see the appeal."
777,2447,Great game.  Extremely adictive.  Say goodbye to all your spare time...and all your other games.
778,2447,Once in awhile my creeps will survive through the safe period.
779,2447,"Survival advice:Join the slack channel! Recent studies have found that regular slack activity reduces your chance of !murder by 80%.Losing Is Fun. Your first attempt at an empire will fail. Learn from it and try again. Improvements to your code base are far, far more valuable than any rooms you might have lost.This is not a zombie apocalypse; don't roll out with your creep shotgun ready to shoot every shambling 1-room AI you can reach. Your neighborhood zombies are providing you a useful service. Think of them as a warm corpse blanket that you wrap around yourself and help you hide from the nearby 300 CPU titan.You know that lab / mineral compound stuff that you'll ""get to eventually""? Every player around you that ""got to that eventually"" can wipe you whenever they want to. They haven't yet because you are providing them a useful service. See the above point.Your walls and ramparts do not have enough hits.Your walls and ramparts do not have enough hits.Sooner or later you will have TooAngel trying to move in next to you and will have to regularly spray for his creeps. We think there's a nest somewhere. Don't leave any energy crumbs out.Play with the market! You can start getting benefit from that mineral source pretty early. But don't worry when prices swing wildly. It is almost certainly dissi's fault."
780,2447,An excellent programming exercise. Very addicting
781,2447,var life = null;while ( !life ) { screeps() }
782,2447,The best game that looks like work.And feels like work.And actually carries your learnt skills to work.11/10 Will become an awesome node.js developer one day.
783,2447,Brillant!
784,2447,"If you ever wanted to try your hand at writing an RTS AI, this is that, as a game itself. An enticing premise that is  -- mostly -- delivered on. The mechanics of the game are still in flux, but it seems to be headed in a good direction."
785,2447,If you enjoy coding and the artificial intelligence field you should definitely try this game.
786,2447,"Very fun little game, im quite in love with it. The comunity is really good as well, no real hate anywhere and everyone is real friendly great for those just starting or exspierenced people. there appears to be starting areas for new beginers and theres 30 days free trial so try it out."
787,2447,Ever wanted to write a bot for an MMO economy but didn't want to get banned? Its the whole point of the gameplay - go have fun!
788,2447,"Great game, you know how t ogrite code on Java and how to make it works!! Awesome!!!!"
789,2447,"Highly reccomended game IF you understand the basics of programming. You could learn the basics using a seperate course, and this would help with learning javascript, but don't use this soley to learn. I'm used to programming(Using GML(game maker language), Visaul basic and C#), but completely new to javascriptI'll describe my expenrience with it:So, I played the web browser tutorial after descovering this game and was like ""cool, I'd play this"". Bought the game, found a nice little spot with 2 energy sources in one of the ""Novice area's"". At the start of the game, your room is in ""safe mode"", meaning you can't immediately get picked off by hostile enemies, so they reccomend building your base and some defenses during this time.I spent 4 hours setting up the harvesters, upgraders and automatic spawning, I had to manually spawn for a little while after cause I messed up the auto spawn and I was getting to grips with javascript. I also had to keep tinkering to make it a little more efficient. I checked back on it at the end of the day and found that my upgrader's werent spawning, so I panicked and spawned another. If you don't have a creep actively upgrading your controller, you lose control of the room and can't build in there, so make sure this is one of your first priority's.After this, I started some code on builders the next day, I had the most bashed togethers builders ever due to me not knowing how to use the 'memory' variables. They travel to the source, grab one bit of energy instead of filling till their capacity. then wander over to the first construction site that was made to build it,then spend ages walking all the way back. My harvesters harvest one specific energy source, so I've set the builders and upgraders to the other one, conviniently the other source is right next to the controller I'm supposed to upgrade.The day after, I made my builders build on the closest construction site to them, meaning I got some roads near each source quickly.Carried on building up my base, and decided to be a bit cheeky and invade some base that wasn't stocking a tower that defends them, my unit's chanting ""VICTORY!"" as I destroyed their resources. After this I proceeded to another room and invaded that.Overall, I'd really reccomend this if you enjoy programming, may get a bit of getting used to but I enjoy it, might be because I also enjoy dwarf fortress."
790,2447,Really interesting.  Would recommend.
791,2447,"Definitely not meant for non-programmers. The building blocks are fairly basic, and what you can do with them is accordingly flexible but challenging. I like the feeling of building up various pieces of control structure, and watching my colony improve in the process.That said, if you're not already a programmer, this is not the most friendly introduction. The console is not fantastic, and the docs are technically complete but lacking a lot of examples and guidance.That said, if you know some Javascript, give it a shot. It's definitely an entertaining challenge."
792,2447,"After the first few hour reading the doc and tutorials, the game became intensely fun and challenging. Easily one of the most innovative game concepts I have ever seen!"
793,2447,Great fun :)
794,2447,"Awesome game. If you like programming and/or if you want to learn Javascript, this is definatelly for you. Great fun with learning included. I can't stop thinking abut my creeps and how to improve my code."
795,2447,Relatively easy to pick up. Good TutorialThe game is really slow on the public servers :(
796,2447,Just got the game a few days ago. Already enjoying it alot.
797,2447,"It feels so different to type commands instead of a simple right click! Makes you think about the underlying mechanics everytime! Now with the ddedicated server, it's purely awesome!"
798,2447,"This is way too addictive. I have so much work that I should've been doing, but that time was committed to improving my AI instead.I used to hate Javascript. Now I just dislike it a lot. I planned to leaver a longer, detailed and more in-depth review of this game, but I just noticed some ineffectiveness in my task management that I need to fix.Get the game."
799,2447,"I've never written in JavaScript before, but I have a little experience with other languages, so I have decided to buy it for fun/educational purpose (and to motivate myself towards learning a new language). After taking half a night (steam lies, you can play on the browser) to solve a single problem my creeps finally are spawning automatically and collecting resources. What I have written isn't anything good but boy you know this feeling of satisfaction when your code runs without complaint."
800,2447,"The game is awesome, even more so with the addition of private servers! Getting the creeps to keep the base running is quite easy but getting them do that efficiently and doing more advanced stuff without getting errors is awesomely hard."
801,2447,I love this game :)
802,2446,"Can you code?If no, this game is not for you. Sorry.If you can code, and preferably in Javascript (there is compilers that can help you if you have another prefered languages) then this game is most definetly for you!I've become a much better developer due to all the refactoring and code decisions that I've made during my game time.Basically this game is about building an ant farm, programming behavior of the ants.Designing ants body parts to handle a certain task. These ants are called Creeps. The creeps only do what you tell them to (by coding their behavior). Your antfarm continues to work, even though you are not online which gives the game even more dept, because you need to plan for both resource gathering, spawning new creeps, and general survivability (defense).With both an open mmo world, and with the new localhost server - you have a perfect way to test out strategies in local server against bots, and implement the strategies in the open mmo world against real players.There is an amazing and helpful community ( screeps(dot)slack(dot)com ), and a very good API documentation. There is even a free tutorial that let you learn all the basics required to get started without too much hazzle.You can find youtube video tutorials, and there is even some players that shared their antfarm ai code on github (just search for sceeps).There are tons of hours of gameplay. I havent even scratched the surface on ""end-game"" stuff, like minerals, research, boosting creeps, and trading on the market, so I still have a lot to look forward to (even after 176 hours played at the time of writing). A note about hours played, is that it only counts if you are using the steam client. Playing through the browser (which is also an option), does not count your hours in steam."
803,2446,"Lovely. Hard, But Lovely. Now I can feel better than all my friends who play clash of clans."
804,2446,"Great game, great idea, even if JS is a piece of poo-poo.Wasted hours just watching my wimpy colony of creeps waddle back and forth.Wish there was a little better documentation."
805,2446,Great game that uses javascript coding to control your creeps.
806,2446,"Screeps isn't going to be the game for everyone. But, if you like to code, and know a bit of JAVA or are willing to learn then go for it. A unique experience that has you checking back and continually optimizing your own literal colony.The game continues to be updated and with the introduction of the new shard (world) tick length is once again at a reasonable level."
807,2446,10/10
808,2446,Refreshingly original and challenging..... also one of a kind (as far as I can tell..). This game is good fun and you learn a thing or two as well about Javascript programming!10/10 Would buy again!
809,2446,"I don't really review games, but in this case I will. Screep should really be an early access game. The server ticks are very slow, and there is weird memory issuse serverside. Still buggy; do not recommend."
810,2446,Massively addictive.
811,2446,Game is ok. Developer is patronizing and cannot accept negative feedback.
812,2446,"I found this lovely game by accident while browsing through Steam, and since then I've lost several hours to it writing, revising and perfecting code. It's strangely addicting.The fun lies in successfully automating the script. It's especially satisfying when I come back from a tedious day to see that my base has grown by itself.It was rocky for me at first, since my programming was absolutely rusty: I needed to take several hours for one step of a tutorial just to analyze the practices and methodologies used (along with the documentation). I even needed to look back at my course notes to refresh my memory. However, afterwards it was smooth sail: the game's mechanics became natural to me and I decided to refine some scripts to get a good start in multiplayer.I'm very happy I found this game, I have finally something productive AND fun to do."
813,2446,Love it!!
814,2446,"// goOutside();

815,2446,"So I got this like 2 days ago... It's become a problem. If you like programming, get it! It is an RTS game that you program and optimize yourself with the goal being that your AI is self-sufficient. The game runs 24/7 online on a single server to duke it out among players. Versatile creeps, constructed and customized from 7 unique parts and up to a max of 50 appendages makes up your force. Make guys that mine, chop, shoot, build, or whatever you want within the JavaScipt API. There's just something satisfying coding something, then immediately watching something happen (or maybe not happen). Tutorial walks you through gathering resources, autonomous respawning, building, turrets, and upgrading. Other than that there is a chat and the internet! Screeps.com features the full tutorial for free and play afterwards in that simulation room as long as you want. Steam edition allows for unlimited single player sandbox world vs AI, unlimited private server, or access to the single MMO world. CPU subscription basically means in MMO you get 30 days of 30 starting cpu max, capped at 300, rising by 10 per Global Control Level (Account XP basically). CPU is essentially amount of code used per turn, such as how many creeps you can have simultaneously. Otherwise if you don't subscribe after that it is 10 starting capped at 10 permanently which kind of sucks but its only on MMO server. I saw someone mention code for an enemy AI was available on Github but never found a link.My recommendation if you are new to programming (I would do at least a course in programming or the JavaScript tutorial linked by the game before playing) is to go through tutorial (obviously) then take the code from the respawn AI tutorial 4, and the constructing buildings in tutorial 3. This will let you get guys gathering resources, upgrading, respawning, and building while you perfect your code and/or rewrite the tutorial code. th_pion also did a pretty long tutorial series I just found, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edBMmOAfJ-Q&list=PL0EZQ169YGlor5rzeJEYYPE3tGYT2zGT2"
816,2446,"Recommend? Yes, Yes a 1000 times yes.I have a background in C# and Java development  (mostly Web Automation with Selenium Web Driver). So I am familiar with basic programming concepts, but have never used Javascript and thought this might be a fun way to spend a few hours.Now I am 20 hours in and hooked.I spent 3 hours setting up an IntelliJ, Git, ScreepsAutocomplete setup .. where I do all my coding in IntelliJ and commit/push it to Git where it autoupdates the World screen (which I have fullscreen on a spare TV 24/7) .I fancy myself a petty dictator in a small banana-republic somwhere .. here is the main part of my loop :)    if(defenseCzar.areWeUnderAttack() == ""true"")        defenseCzar.executeRoomDefenseStrategy()    if(defenseCzar.areWeAtWar() == ""true"") {        defenseCzar.executeWartimeStrategy()    }    else {        interiorCzar.maintainInfrastructure()        interiorCzar.executePeacetimeExpansionPolicy()    }    economicCzar.decommissionUnusedResources()"
817,2446, it! This Game forced me to learn something useful in my life....
818,2446,"verry immature community beyond 100 or so hours terrible to playsteam client is also verry unstabile.  when you get more then one room. its a nightmare,verry unieuqe concept yet verry poorly executed. everything locksup freezes and the comunity is eutopia thinking idiots that think its a community garden simulator or such.. forget it being advertised as MMORG, its far from it.. its basicly just a RTS no roleplaying at all, just hysterical noobsaswell the scripting deal isnt special there plenty of premade frameworks performing just fine witch makes it nomore then a (expensive) RTSthere plenty of games that allow you to script. or roleplay or RTS without having to stand this piece of grief. or waste this type of money on subscriptions.even gets worse, it has left early acces with all the bugs still in there. making it even more trash then it whas early acces in my opion, it should have never left early acces in this stateif you can code then the next step of coding something like this in a whole should be just as fun perhapese even more sasisfying then dealing with this piece of crap.ill give it a 9 for orginality tho. and it got me hooked for a long time. but after you done scripting its this week wait til you can do the next thing. and thats when you realy notice this piece of crap ruining your day."
819,2446,"Screeps is a pretty fun game if you already understand the basics of JavaScript.  If you are an expert in some of the other languages that can be compiled down to JavaScript, there is some support for Scala, Fsharp, Dart, CoffeeScript, TypeScript and clojurescript etc. I'm sure it wouldn't be hard to implement the game in other languages if you prefer.  I see the potential for this game as a teaching software but I also see it as a really fun Video game. As a expert JavaScript programmer, I had no problems reading the admittedly skimpy documentation and building some fairly complex AI systems. The Cost to play the game could be a gate to stop some people from trying it, but unlike other Sub based video games, you cost is actually justified. The actual CPU/Server cost of hosting this many javascript game loops in a concurrent real-time system is pretty steep. Also, if you want to try the game, just go over to their website and play through the tutorial and simulator.  This will give you a decent idea of if you like this style of game or not. There are many ways to approach this game.  You can build an AI system that dynamically shifts based on the rooms you are in and the events that are happening in the world that you can see.  You can choose to make a set of AI that uses just a bunch of simple If/else statments or build up large classes and prototypes.  You can completely overhaul and create your own methods that help you accomplish things that aren't currently in the API. Having to script on the fly when a player attacks you can be quite a bit of fun and can be a bit intense.  Overall, I can certainly recommend Screeps but only to people who have a solid understanding of programming. If you don't have at a basic understanding of JavaScript or programming in general you might find yourself a bit too lost to be able to fully take advantage of your free first month. You can certainly sit down with the tutorial and simulator and try to sharpen you skills that way, but I can't recommend buying the full game unless you are confident enough in your programming skills."
820,2446,"I am a programmer and initially when I was first introduced to Screeps by my brother I thought oh no I really don't want to program after work when I've been doing it all day! But i tried it and loved it. If you like programming or want to learn it then this is the game for you!The reason why I like it is not because you can program but simply because the game presents you with many challenges that need to be overcome and you have so many ways of doing this! It is very interesting to also see how others have solved the problem by watching their room for abit as well.For example the main tutorial teaches you to send a creep to harvest energy and it goes backward and forwards to your spawn, but do you continue with this method? Or do you build one creep to work on the source (energy) and one creep to pick up the harvest? Do you put a container below him or beside him? So many possibilities and that to me equals endless fun.console.log('Just five more minutes to figure this out...');"
821,2445,"Note about hours played: I started playing with the steam client, but soon moved to the web interface (It's the same world/account, it doesn't matter which you use). Hours spent is more in the 600+ range by now. Great game, I heartily recommend it! To thoose on the fence regarding programming background - I took a few programming classes in college (6+ years ago), but haven't done anything with it since. I did the tutorial for Screeps, and went through some of the free javascript courses and was able to get into it. The first couple weeks were a struggle as I got all of the syntax down (and was killed once), but since then my code (and knowledge) has grown a lot. Those who are already experienced programmers can get into it a lot faster, I'm sure. The fun of the game primarily comes from first figuring out how to get things done (holy crap my creeps are actually mining energy and returning it to make more!), and then for optimizing it (uh oh my creeps are mining energy but are blocking each other....). There's also a flourishing alliance system, with wars being declared on other players/alliances, with WW2 blitzkrieg attacks overwhelming players in a matter of an hour or two, to established alliances/players nuking and fighting back and forth for days at a time, a war of economies and attrition. Like most multiplayer games, the game will be what you make it. Join the active slack chat, interact with the players/neighbors, ask for help, and it will be a lot of fun. Every new problem/issue you solve in the game brings a great feeling of accomplishment with it. There's nothing quite like coding a little army to attack your annoying neighbor and destroy them!"
822,2445,cant seem to close the game sometimes
823,2445,Game is fun.
824,2444,"This game is so good I once forgot to sleep! It feels like there is always something to do, whether it's adding a completely new feature to your AI or improving optimisation or analysing some data or whatever you think of or want to have.Documentation is ok, but could be better.Community on Slack is fun, active and very helpful.Before you buy the game, you can try for free the tutorial and simulation mode on screeps webpage and see if it's something you like."
825,2444,"First of, a little bit of background: I am a Computer IT. I have a diploma and a degree. Started building computers around the age of 8 with my father.During my degree, which I just finished recently, I had to program a lot. Most of the time what I would program was for class, so not necessarily useful or interesting. That made me lose a bit of interest in coding. I know many languages and I've gotten to a point where I feel like I can learn any new language. It's just a matter of syntax, I already have the logic dialed in.Javascript is the most used scripting language on the web. Needless to say that I had to do a lot of it during my degree. I have worked with the framework upon which the game is built: NodeJS. Even made my own chat-server with NodesJS. It was built by google and can be very good for asynchronous operations. I have yet to implement asynchronous functions in screeps but I'm planning to use memory and callbacks to minimize CPU usage.Anyway, I diverged a bit there, my main point was that the work I had to do during my degree made me lose my interest in coding a bit.. okay maybe more than I can admit. But Screeps, I must say thanks. Thank you to the developers, this sparked my interest back. I am constantly thinking about algorithms, that's where I want to be, using my brains.I wake up in the morning thinking about my creeps, my new-born AI, how I need to check if everything is going alright. I have all sorts of designs and I cannot wait for the private servers to be available. Definitely going to make my own.I 100% recommend this to anyone, but my opinion is a little bit biased :P. Steep learning curve if you don't know programming but sooo worth it. Learn how to code in fun.My advice: when you don't know the javascript syntax then google ""javascript function"" and find your answers directly in the javascript documentation. For example array.sort() doesn't belong to the screeps libraries but to javascript. Learn to see those things. (If you can't find it in the Screeps documentation it most likely belongs to javascript)When you don't know what is going wrong use the console: console.log(whateverisuseful). Debug your code.When you don't know something about the screeps classes look at the API documentation on support.screeps.com. For example everything you need to know about creeps is in the documentation. Every single property the creep has and every single function. Every single body part you can give... Error codes are listed and even sample code for each function is under the ... Same for structures.. Everything is there, you just need to read it carefully and use it with your code. Don't trust people who will not take the time do their homework and who give poor reviews to this game. The documentation is very full and the game is fantastic.I have played everyday since I got the game and I am pretty sure there was an update every single day.(Today that is three days) The devs are very busy and the game is very alive.In case you are wandering about the lifetime CPU limit of 10, it's more than enough to increase your GCL(Global control level) with proper code, and the CPU limit increases with GCL. Gotta search on support.screeps.com to understand better. Basically, if you play well(optimized code and maximal usage of what's around you), you can increase your CPU limit without paying anything. A little bit more about GCL. Basically, every room has a controller which has a controller level. To increase the controller level you need to upgrade it. Every ""point"" you put towards upgrading the RCL(Room control level) counts towards upgrading the GCL. With one room you can upgrade your GCL, thus upgrading your CPU limit.The GCL does not decay so if you managed to achieve a certain CPU limit you will keep that for lifetime. The one month CPU limit of 30, that you buy with the game is mooooore than enough to increase GCL and get setup for future games. Increase it as soon as you buy the game and then you will be able to come back and get setup more easily.EDIT: It seems your GCL increased CPU limit is only active while a subscription is active. So even by playing there is no way around paying. Shame.. Oh well there is still the private servers. Oh if you want to see screeps videos they are a looot easier to find at support.screeps.com under ""what's new"" in the monthly ""world reviews"".(The entire screeps world gets reviewed on a monthly basis and top activity is shared)If the CPU limit still deters you think about this: - EDIT: The private server is now released! You can play on your own server without limits.-You can also do like me and test the demo on screeps.com then decide.This is not a game that will teach you how to program per say. It will teach you the basics of how to manipulate the world but you will learn by yourself how to program. You will have a sandbox to experiment with. You'll see your code function/or not. You'll see it grow or perish! It is very rewarding. Even just the first steps.Hope this review helped! I'ma go check on my creeps :P. Cheers!"
826,2444,"This is an amazing game, it helped me learn JavaScript and I've already logged 24 hours in the past week. The only con? There are very few guides to help you if your code does not work, and even fewer past basic functions (ie auto-spawning or harvesting, building, and repairing). I have only found one vague guide about how to build screeps to defend your room, and I'm not even close to making healer creeps. However, if you can get past probably the steepest learning curve in any game I've ever seen, it is so much fun, combining conquest elements with defence elements, basebuilding elements, and tycoon elements. 10/10 would code again."

829,2442,brilliant game but requires programing knowledge
830,2441,The game i always wanted! I will never have to search for an RTS again.
831,2441,Truly unique game. Great way to learn javascript.
832,2440,Good game concept. Needs more rooms. No 2 resource rooms left.
833,2440,"This game is very difficult. You have to know programming and all the practices that go along with that, including effeciency. You're only given a certain amount of memory and processing power, based on the amount and level of your rooms.You have to manage your resources. Your main one is energy, it's used for everything. You gotta mine it, transport it, store it, and deploy it to everything that needs it as upkeep.You have to know tactics, and how to tell which unit to do what and when. With enough practice and testing, you can even create a beach-head into your enemy's room and construct your own towers and walls. Supply lines, escorts, unit sizes, never before has an RTS given this level of control of your units. However, with great power comes great responsibility, you can easily make a half-defense that's easy to exploit, or a weak attack force that stumbles around and gets kicked over. It has a very steep learning curve, but it's so rewarding, and satisfying watching those little guys run around and do your bidding."
834,2440,"Spectacular. Great game with a wonderful community on Slack. I've gotten totally sucked in, and so has my not-quite-teenage son who is loving programming."
835,2439,this is literally the best game ive ever played by so far
836,2439,For all who love programming and who want to improve their skills is this THE GAME to praktise. The game is much fun and private servers also allow to battle your friends. BUT BEWARE: this is NOT a game for beginners and Script kiddies.
837,2439,"Extremely fun game to play as developer! It's a bit hard to start, but after that it's very much fun to see your scripts take over the world!"
838,2438,"Alright I've got a nice little base set-up over here. Got my energy miners, got some creeps hauling energy from the miners to the stores. Got a nice little tower set-up to defend against any attackers... Oh, there's an attacker right now.  MY TOWER CODE IS RETURNING ERRORS, QUICK FIX THE BUGS WHILE THE ATTACKER IS COMING FOR MY TOWERS! That went alright. OH  MY SECOND ROOM IS UNDER ATTACK, IT HAS NO TOWER DEFENSE, AND I DIDNT GET TO MY COMBAT UNIT CODE YET. Never have I coded under this much pressure. 10/10"
839,2438,"Super fun for the creative mind. I stayed up until 4 am the first day trying to get my spawn up and ready. I picked a pretty bad spawn, so I ended up restarting. However, I had a blast trying to code a ""thief"" creeper that would go to my neighbours' land who had unguarded drop miners, and steal from him :P It was hilarious. I even had my creeps say ""Thanks bro"" as they walked away with 250+ energy each. Wish there were more claimable land. I spent a few hours just seeking out all the claimable land. All of them are , the good stuff is all taken and its hard to even think about taking it away from someone.. :P maybe one day >:)"
840,2438,"Overall rating is very positive, but i don't think this reflects current state of game.Here is what i got on my mind.little update: I didn't really wanted to downvote screeps, i just want to point out some issues that aren't disclosured on store page.Response to dev: I aggree with some points, but i'm not going change opinion about subscription trading.You may see fast swarming creeps in trailers, but the game is VERY slow. Tick rate is constantly raising from what i read ( 1.5 to 2.5 steam release and currently  3 seconds per tick).For example if your creep is not fatigued (eg. walking on road) he can move once per 3 seconds and if you have colony (like me) in swamp it's very annoying.Check current tick rate yourself  (3.30 at this time)Which also mean you will get less value from subscription (less ticks per month).If there is still chance to buy screeps without subscription like was before i would do that. Because before you hit 10CPU limit subscription will expire (maybe little exaggerating, depends how successful you will be).Then there is subscription token trading (you can't trade first month you bought with game), thing i fear most. When you get controller level to use market you can sell subscription tokens for (any?) resources. I'm trying to avoid pay to win games and this still isn't disclosured anywhere on store page.Novice areas aren't really novice, it's place where everyone (veterans and new players) can start from scratch without being wiped by fully developed players.Most players in novice will die out because got error in code after going offline.If not and  player is not fast enough to build tower before first free safe mode runs out he is in big trouble. He get's rushed or is forced to waste safe mode by low effort rush attack.Rooms get safe mode every controller upgrade (it's very slow and limited) or by using ghodium which i bet you can buy with subscription tokens.Safe mode length by current tick rate is 18 hours, no cooldown on safe mode in novice area is verry annoing.I got more things on mind, but these are main issues."
841,2437,"As programmer I can say, that this game is specially for us :) at leats no dumb kids in this game :D"
842,2436,Built up for a week only to get demolished overnight...RIP
843,2436,"At first I didn't like the game. When you first start off it feels shallow, but after you start to learn how to play you realize that there's alot to it, and you kindof get that factorio draw to it ""i'll just do this one last thing, and it's 4 am"". One thing I think needs to be improved is that once you get your code written, there's nothing more you really can do but wait for the next level. It needs like minigames, or something. Another concern I have is about code that has just been copy pasted from github. Another issue, it seems is that occasionally the world will slow down, and take a few seconds for the next tick.I know there's a lot of prospective programmers that are coming to this game, and I would tell them to learn how to program before investing in the game first. They do have the simulator for you to use for free in the meantime."
844,2436,It's quite addicting to want to constantly improve your scripts to better your creeps progression.
845,2435,I am now a robot.
846,2435,"Excellent Game!Screeps is a very well executed universe in which you can program your own A.I. In order for your AI to learn, it should have the need for resources, experience threats and live in an ever changing universe.The Screeps world delivers exactly that. The fact that all players inhibit the same world, only amount to these benefits.You're programming skills will develop. Nothing pushes the envelope as a Screep invasion.... The free Demo and the API closed the deal for me."
847,2434,Just fended off an attack and then counter attacked by writing code under pressure.Amazing.
848,2434,Screeps is one of thse games that keep you up at night wondering if your code works or if someone's going to attack you. A simple mistake could be the end of your colony. If you like programming this is a game for you.
849,2434,"I wonder how my Screeps are going.I wonder how my SCREEPS ARE GOING.i played this game for about 1-2 weeks straight.i love the concept.5/10 Would never play multiplayer in this state again. needs to be bigger. and procedual. with better buildings.1/1 i recommend but i don't recomend playing it for a long time.not in its current state, is it worth playing anymore. but i did learn a few programming tricks."
850,2434,Pretty awesome game with a huge learning curve!
851,2434,"It not often that a game compels me to stay up till 2am making multipage excel spreadsheets with charts and graphs, color coded and loaded with functions. This game presents you with constant challenges to which there are numerous ways to solve.  It is Dynamic, expansive, and challenging."
852,2434,God I hate this game it is to fun it neads to be taken down. Can you report a game for that?
853,2434,"I don't really like it, I spend a lot of my time programming, but there's something about it that I don't like, maybe it's all the random proprietary functions, but I don't know. It might be better with a functional programming language such as lisp or haskell, in general I feel like JavaScript was a bad choice for this game. I might try it again once some more languages become supported, but for now I'm going to refund it because I don't see myself playing this much."
854,2433,"""I want to like this game...""Screw those reviews. I liked this game."
855,2433,"Very well done. I am a full time FE dev, so the JS is totally welcome. I find myself constantly thinking of new strategies and things to input. This game is the programming game I've been looking for!"
856,2433,10/10 would code again
857,2433,"Love this game! Never played anything else like it. After playing this for a month now, I've learned a lot more, not just about Javascript, but about programming in general. If you have any interest in coding, even if you don't have any experience yet, this is a great game to provide you with a reason to write code.Keep in mind also that you will likely need to continue purchasing CPU subscriptions if you want to continue playing after the initial month included with the Steam purchase. The 10 CPU it provides without a subscription is not enough for more than 1 or 2 well optimized rooms. Although, perhaps squeezing as many rooms into that narrow CPU bandwidth would be an interesting challenge for players so inclined."
858,2432,"Well made, fun programming game! The web interface is a bit slow, and the steam client has some memory leaks, but those don't really matter for the game itself.The persistent server is always running, and restarting the client or web interface is but a few seconds of not viewing your colony."
859,2432,"Fascinating game. I've often played build/manage simulators and wished I could just re-script the character behavior to optimize for my own playstyle. Well, now I can!Thumbs up with a couple of reservations:This feels like neither a game for beginners nor a game for advanced programmers.It doesn't claim to *teach* programming, mind you, but I feel like it could be - with just a few more really well-thought out defaults, some more automatic instant feedback, and probably lots of good interactive tutorials. The goals/problems it sets are super appealing, and the naive solutions are *almost* easy to come up with for a highly motivated beginner, but I think still just out of reach without being motivated enough to spend hours reading through documentation when you aren't even sure you can figure out the documentation.For advanced programming, I have a couple of gripes:- No actual CPU profiling/detailed feedback on CPU usage in a game whose main constraint is CPU usage. - No (built-in) ability to make your own interface elements in a game about JavaScript programming. I want to make graphs and custom UI elements for my own crazy creep-management logic.- Lots of small annoyances that get in the way: The autocompletion and other Ace editor defaults; the number of clicks to access useful information; the strange choices the game makes about whether to email you about your runtime errors (if it came from the console, I'm pretty sure I know about it already!); the lack of documentation for simple things like: how much stuff costs to spawn; how the resource economy operates; what the frigging constants are that I'm supposed to use in places where a constant is a parameter to a function (e.g. FIND_*).But what's really cool about this game is that it *is* integrated with many open-source tools, and hopefully/probably standard JS libraries? so I imagine if I really wanted to, I could work around a lot of these."
860,2432,"It's like MIT -- Battlecode: the MMO, in slow mo!Horrible rhymes aside, 90% of the game is staring at your IDE/text editor wondering why your code isn't making your creeps move. If you're into that you should get this game! (The other 90% is watching your ingame neighbors.)"
861,2431,Mom's spaghetti code
862,2431,Addictive I am recomedning to programmers and NON worth the money.
863,2431,"This is one of the most fascinating games I've ever played.Screeps is basically a 24/7 MMO-RTS game where you write the AI of your force, and fight against other players' AIs. A large part of your AI is the management of your economy, which becomes progressively more challenging (respawn creeps, build roads, exploit other rooms, settle other rooms, combine minerals, and so on). The mechanics feel very fun and polished, and the devs have plans to add more challenges for experienced players.At the beginning, you control just one room, and start in a novice area where you fight for domination with other new players. The area opens up over time, becoming part of the whole world over 30 days, where you compete or trade with all other players,  and build an empire spanning more than 30 rooms. Even if you're wiped out, you can quickly reach your old strength, as the number of rooms you can settle never decreases.As this game is one of its kind, there are a few things to consider if you want to play it: Almost all interaction is done by writing JavaScript modules, so if you don't consider programming fun, you won't enjoy Screeps. You can start even as a complete programming novice, but you will need to invest a lot of time if you want to go beyond the basics.Also, if you spawn close to a more experienced player, she will kill you easily if she wants. So if you're unlucky, you'll wipe repeatedly until you know how to defend your base, and where it is safe to spawn. This will be challenging and frustrating, so be prepared for that.A third point is that the progression of the game is rather slow; you will build only a few buildings each day, and settle a new room every week (up to a month later). A single organized attack takes 1-2 hours at least, and taking a well-defended room will take days."
864,2431,Terribly addicting.
865,2430,"As the description of the game says, it's a game for programmers.Being myself a programmer, I just don't find this game is any fun or interesting enough as a programming practice.I enjoyed other programming games like TIS-100, but not this one.Not recommended."
866,2430,"Quite a fun game, but you definately must have experience in programming to really play the game.As someone who has experience in other programming languages but not JavaScript this is a fun way to test myself in a new language!"
867,2430,"Pretty good game. I have to be honest though, the trailer is a bit misleading. The game is not NEARLY as fast as that. The trailer makes everything look fast paced and fun. The game is very slow, and there's a LOT of waiting involved.It's pretty often you'll just spawn in and instantly die not long after. It's hard to ""be good"" at first. It's also worth noting since everyone can program here, most people are actually relatively mature and can get along with you. Sometimes reaching out to them and asking them to team is worth it!Other than that, it has a surprisingly nice JavaScript interface that makes quite a bit of sense. It's very fun to make your setup more and more optimized and pretty. I'd definitely recommend this game to anyone that likes programming, that is patient, and is willing to die a bit to start off."
868,2430,helios will attack u if u buy it so dont spawn near him
869,2430,"OMG this game is so great!  You start off with nothing, just nothing. you have to program you bots to do everything from harvest, to store and upgrade.  You're in control of every little behavior.  Nothing is canned.I think this is gonna beat out factorio in playtime this week.."
870,2429,"I'm very much a fan of this addictive game. I'm reasonably experienced javascript so about about 20 hours in I started feeling confident with the API. I can see the utility of this game in a teaching environment, as a bit of a fun aside.Now I can finally use my programming skills for to take over the world.. ***insert evil laugh***"
871,2429,game sucks you instantly lose your spawn after the protection runs out. Waste of money
872,2429,"This programming game is great.Before starting, I just had basic understanding of JavaScript but now I keep getting better and better at it because you have to think of so many different problems and solutions, you discover amazing mechanics you never thought of before.I loved the moment I destroyed a big base which took days to build because the defensive AI didn't work. Now he has no spawner nor creeps but at least he repaired the AI ;DI don't know if I keep the subscription running over a longer time but I will open a private server on my own as soon as the local server feature is released (no, I will not open it to everyone).PS: This is one of the few games I actualy write a review for because it is so amazing and I want more to see it :D"
873,2429,"I am not a programmer, but I got my creeps to harvest some energy.  I got my creeps to make more creeps.  I got my creeps to improve their colony.I am not a programmer, but I got my creeps to build some containers, to build a storage, to build defenses.I am not a programmer, but I got my creeps to gather arms, to rally together, and to defeat my enemy who was camped right next to me.I am not a programmer, but I got my creeps to establish a new colony, to expand into a new area, and to work together with my main colony to become stronger than ever.I am still not a programmer, but maybe my creeps will eventually get me there, as I teach them how to dominate their world under my name."
874,2429,Complicated
875,2429,"Ok..... Look, I like this game.  I understand it's a work in progress and accept that there will be some bumps along the way.  My actual grievances are specifically targeted at the development team and not the software.  I have been playing this today and had to restart no less than 4 times to get new updates.  I mean, SERIOUSLY, are you guys a professional software development team and run 4 breaking-change releases in the same day?!  That is shameful!  I'm concerned about the long-term success of this project.  If it goes under, I'm betting it will be because of the development practices being used and not because the game wasn't good."
876,2429,"BRILLIANT GAME {   screeps( 'AWSOME, AWSOME, AWSOME,)}NOTE: while this is a brilliant game it requires significant programming skills to play, so if you are new to programming i sugest learning the basics first."
877,2429,This game is really amazing. I'm able to get a grasp of code pretty quickly by seeing such quick real world disasters. I've killed 3 neighbours. Awesome.
878,2428,"I really like Screeps. A game you play almost entirely through programming?! Awesome :D Test your programming skills, learn a ton, make a mistake that destroys your colony, rebuild even stronger... it's really cool. And it's easy to use your own IDE, sync through GitHub, or program via the Screeps interface that is complete with memory watching as well! And the API documentation is plenty sufficient.With that said, the downsides: I don't like JavaScript... I've always used C#- it's object oriented, typed, and compiled... and so I've had a *lot* of hangups with JavaScript since it's not object oriented, not explicitly typed, and since it's run-time scripting. Even though JavaScript is a huge turn-off for me (as are a lot of languages that run the web- PHP, PERL, etc), I have to say the game is a fantastic sandbox.10/10 would accidentally destroy my colony with a bug in the code just to re-do it all over again!"
879,2428,It's a real challenging game. I love coding and i love playing with this game!Highly recommended to all new and experienced programmer. Totally worth the price.
880,2428,"That feeling when your little autonomous minions are dancing along to a carefully ochestrated sontata you've composed. That feeling when you go to bed knowing your farm is in good automated hands, and wake up to realize you were right. That feeling when you've been at work all day and come home to a wall of script errors because you're you, and that's the kinds of things you're likely to do as a human (and you're inability to catch an improperly cased variable name will be the death of you).I write code all day for a living. The last thing I thought I wanted to was to come home and write more code as a way to ""unwind"". But honestly, that's exactly what this gives. Yes, it's writing code. Yes, it requires you to think about and architect CLEAN, reusable, and solid code, which is stressful and difficult. But some how, for some reason, once you've completed that harvester behavior refactor you've been working on, it all becomes worth it when you look at the little moving dot and say ""Yes, little one. THAT is what I wanted you to do.""I can assert that I've only barely scratched the surface of what the full long-term game is going to feel like, but I've already found myself, multiple times, saying ""I can't believe a game like this exists."" I'm truly shocked and elated that there is actually a way to unwind AND code at the same time. It has been an absolute delight to bring my little minions to life and automate their existence. I've been writing JavaScript for a couple years now. It's never been my main toolkit, but as a Web Engineer it certainly does pop up a lot. So an excercise that forces you to think in clean, modular, and maintainable JS that accounts for things that may or may not happen is a godsend. Bonus points for being super fun and relaxing, too!Cannot recommend this enough. If you're a hardcore JavaScript guy/gal, come in here and rule the world. If you're a mid-level like myself, you'll find ample fun and enjoyment out of this game. If you're completely new, come get wreckt! Because you will... at first. But if you can read the docs, find all the online help available for this game, and piece it all together in a way that works, you'll have a blast and learn more than you ever thought you could from a game.10/10 would automate existence again"
881,2428,"First of all, if you think this game will teach you to program think again.  You need to know how to program before playing this game because if you're struggling with that alone you'll never get anywhere.  You need to understand pathfinding, dependency graphs, etc, beyond just programming.It's also way too much work for somebody who has a life.  I'm a full time software developer and even with my experience there's just too much work to do.  Things break easily unattended so it takes a lot of time tweaking your software to handle various situations.  You can clone somebody else's repo (or copy paste somebody else's code) but that's not very fun and still needs close monitoring.It may be feasible if a few developers worked together optimizing the software for a single account.  But even then, I do this all day at my job.  This isn't a very fun ""game"".  It's work.This is an early access game and is missing the following as of right now:* No debugger capabilities (even in simulator)* Poor API documentation* API objects aren't unit testable (no dependency injection)* software syncing UX is poor* simulator state can't be saved"
882,2428,"If you're a programmer, or interested in programming at all, this game is absolutely amazing. As has been said before, this really is a programmer's paradise. Endless possibilities, strategies and fun. The community is pretty fantastic too. They have an active Slack channel where you can ask tons of questions and everyone on it is extremely helpful.Expect to die, and die often, especially when you first start out, but each death is a massive learning opportunity.My #1 recommendation for anyone getting into the game though would be to look in to TypeScript as opposed to pure JavaScript for your development. It will save you a ton of time and headaches as it's much more Object Oriented than vanilla .js"
883,2428,"Anyone who has ever coded or who as every thought about coding and likes games will adore this game. The possibility to play a builder game but control the actions with self-written scripts is amazing!There are tutorials and examples, so not being good at coding or not knowing how to do it, is no excuse! :)"
884,2428,If you are a programmer and are willing to learn Javascript or a language that can compile to Javascript you will get at least some enjoyment out of this game.I've spent way too much time writing and optimizing code for my units but I've enjoyed every second of it.There is a Slack for players and tons of repositories on GitHub if you need examples.  I already have over 250 commits to a repository full of code for this game.
885,2428,"Game has a great core concept and the excecution looks great, but I didn't get much playtime due to immensely slow tick speed. Maybe it's a bug, maybe I just have the most expensive/ computer in the history of time, but the game was giving me about 1 tick per 7 seconds, and is unplayable at the moment. But I'll definitely be checking in periodically to see if it's fixed. Still excited to play!"
886,2428, my programming sucks. I love this game. everyone is better than me. I don't care. go play this game.
887,2427,"If you hesitate to buy the game, I suggest to try their tutorial here Online tutorialAs a programmer I never learn so quickly a language, the environment and community are great, watch your crops grow and do what you code the best imaginable way to learn Javascript!A Little word about the pricing, the 10 CPU is fair enough to manage 2-3 rooms, you can still fill the bucket and execute some larger actions each 10mins or something like that, also this will make you rewrite your code multiple time to get one more efficient and not only something its worksI would get something like that for every language !"
888,2427,"Help me, I can't stop writing code for my digital ant farm.Sometimes I manage to stop writing code and then I can't stop watching my digital ant farm.I've set up an Elasticsearch/Kibana instance to monitor my digital ant farm so I don't always have to look at it directly.I've learned an entirely new programming language (TypeScript) because of my digital ant farm.I often see the sun come up now. And it's all thanks to these jerks and their amazingly ruinous game.And my digital ant farm.I'll go to bed eventually, but first, I need to implement better spawning mechanics..."
889,2427,"[This is an edited review. My previous review was negative and it only represented a marginal part of the game, i.e. ~10h of game play. I thank all those that commented my previous review pointing this out, specially the developer who took the time to rebut some of my statements.]This game is a blast. I cannot stop coding it.The only concern I have is the pricing strategy. It offers 30 CPUs per one month upon buying, that most likely you will not need. After that, you are stuck with 10 CPUs (or buy a subscription), which I already find too little for playing the complete game (e.g. more than 1 room). Nevertheless, the 15 justify what you will already play, specially because it is an early-access game.That being said, this is a great game, has well documented API, and you will have a lot of fun if you like to code for winning."
890,2427,"Pros: Skill ceiling? What's a ""ceiling""? Helpful community on Slack and Reddit Runs itself All tasks can be automated via scripting depending on how crazy you are Curbstomping other GCL 2 playersCons: community is on Slack 10 CPU limit for non-subscribers is much lower than you expect it to be Learning curve is a cliff, especially for people who lack existing JS know-how Git integration limited to GitHub or filesystem repositoryI'd reccomend getting it on sale if you can. It might be worth the full $15 to some people, but I would argue that's a very small slice of Steam."
891,2427,A heaven for every programmer. Very well documented and endless possibilities even if it's just early access yet!
892,2427,"A fantastic game that has no match.Where lese do you get to be filled with adrenaline while looking for an errant ""{""? :D"
893,2427,"I like this game, it's an interesting concept and I look forward to seeing it devlop.However, although I recommend this game in general, you NEED to know how to code, you will not be able to play this game without that, this game can help teach you to code in javascript but you will need to know the basics of scripting languages first, or if you know any C like language such as Java, that can help a lot too.Either way, enjoy the game and practice your coding skills."
894,2427,Great game!
895,2426,"The game itself is great idea, but in reality it is quite a pain.More support could provide better game experience."
896,2426,you should go to this url: https://screeps.com/a/#!/sim/before considering it.you need to learn how to play this game before you can make use of your 30 days of higher offline cpu usage

900,2426,I stumbled on to Screeps about a month before it hit Steam and was so excited to give it a try. I have not been disappointed.

902,2426,"seems fun, i just didnt get it"
903,2426,"Holy cow, I can't even begin to describe how awesome this game is. If you like programming (and are good at it) and AI then this game is THE ONE!"
904,2426,"As an avid programmer, I don't think I've ever been so happy with a game purchase in my life.It's been years since I've woken up in a buzz, wanting to see how my colony is going and if my code messed up.I hadn't taken the time to learn this particular language yet, so it was a wonderful way of expanding my arsenal of binary-speak.Heed this warning, all ye non-programmers: I'd rather not take away from this game's sales, but I would absolutely recommend heading over to screeps.com and scrolling down, clicking on the LIVE DEMO button, and running through the tutorial. Because this game is programming, and if you don't like it, you won't like it.EDIT: Formatting"
905,2425,"This game is the heaven for every programmer. Without any game programming knowledge you can simply create your own one(with rules of course).Even though its sometimes hard for newer programmers to get a script working, fixing bugs and any other problem that would prevent a smooth run.I'm really looking forward to the own world stuff so i can compete against friends :DEdit: It's  addicting, i'm already at 300 hrs on record."
906,2425,"This game is great, that's my opinion.For my work i have to program in javascript and i'm just learning it. I got the game round the time it became a Steam game and i have learned a lot about javascript since then.The fact that you have to write smart and efficient code is cool and a great idea.I see a lot of people complain that you have to pay to play the game or that you have to pay to win the game. The Steam version gives you access to 10 cpu's that should be enough to play online. And if you don't want to pay to get further in the game then that you can get with the 10 cpu's then don't. I probably won't get a subscription either but i'm happy with that. The 30 cpu's that i got with the starter pack is more than enough for me right now.I can't wait till the stand alone/LAN world will be availible then i can do what i want and i could then even make my scripts work over the LAN on 2 pc's and see what one will win :)For me this is 1 of the best games i bought on Steam and i would give it more thumbs up than 1 if i could."
907,2425,Confusing but Im sure people can figure it out.  NOT ME THOUGH :)
908,2425,"So you think you can program? You love to compete with code. You like strategy games? I have good news: this game is for you! Don't let the simple graphics fool you, this game has huge depth. Essentially you are programming the AI of the game  or rather _your_ AI, competing against the AIs of your opponents.Find you starting place, decide on your strategy, pour it into code, and see your colony die, because you forgot to think about a special case leading to a deadlock when collecting ressources. Fix the bug, extend your code and find ways to do things more efficiently.My harvesters and builders were standing in front of the energy source if I didn't use up the energy in my spawn. Blocking the harvesters or builder and upgrader. My creeps didn't get anything done over night. My colony almost died, because the builders blocked access for the harvesters, So I could not create new creeps to replace those who died of old age. Now they park at the spawn, when full, allowing free access and depositing the energy as fast as possible when needed.My builders were first programmed to repair buildings with the least percent health. Result: Move to building (wall) repair for one tick, move to next building. In the end it was horrendously inefficient, as the builders were mostly just moving back and forth in my cell, painfully slow. A little modification et voila, way more efficient.Right now I am looking for my first prays. Yet I need to find out, how to actually efficiently fight them. Like: How only brake a small hole into their wall, walk through end get the actual objectives.I love this game. I would have preferred Java or Python as ingame programming language, but well, beggars are not choosers. :D"
909,2425,"This is the game i have been looking for a long time. And without even knowing it :DSeriously: * if you can already program and like RTS-ish strategy games: Don't doubt a second and buy it!!!! Persistent Open World and all :)* If you want to learn programming and like RTS games: Try the free demo version first (link below), check out some other players code and tutorials, and buy it if it catches you. Great learning and great fun!* When you like RTS games but all code looks like gibberish to you and you have no intention to change that: Stay far away from this game ;)Demo version good for everyone ofcourse, but Im saying this because the programming is really programming.... Not some simplified game version. So it will require a lot of googling if you are really new to coding, as in more than actual playing time if you want to get stuff done after the tutorial.The tutorial is very helpful in providing very basic starting code though, and with some clever copy pasting you can always get quite far (pro-tip! ;) )So the Awesome, potential turnoffs and the improvement points. The game is still in early access, i trust most the improvement points will be fixed:Awesome:- Programming! And real programming, not some simplified version.- Persistent Multiplayer World. And the world is regularly expanded with to accomodate new players- Semi-Newbie-Friendly (Semi because: Programming...). Your own zone is blocked off for about a day, and you (can) start in a new player zone that has about 25 days of protection. Optional though, so if you feel adventurous... ;)- Total control over your minions- Lots of player code available on GitHub- Web client so you can manage your Screeps anywherePossible Turnoffs (Not my opinion, but will make some people not like it):- Real programming, not easy to pick up- Subscription for the Main Server necessary once you get a decent amount of Screeps and code (no option for private/community servers yet, but will be added in the future)- Very basic graphics. Might improve slightly but will never be AAAImprovement points:- No audio whatsoever. Could use a very subtle background track and some event sounds. Or triggers for us to link our own :)- Web client Code Entry near impossible on (my) android devices atm due to keys not always mapping correctly (and I found out making small code changes on the road is something I apparently want to do :P )- Documentation not always easy to find yet- some glitchesBut yeah, great game overall! Will update review if something drastically changes :)Cheers!Web Trial/Tutorial: https://screeps.com/a/#!/sim/tutorial"
910,2425,"As all developers know: without coffee, no code. You will need coffee, since this game will easily make you forget the time. Hey, it's 4:05am when I'm writing this.You definitely want this game when you are a developer. Javascript knowledge is a pro, but in my opinion not necessary when you have experience in other languages.I'm still learning the basics of creating creeps and let them do chores, and in the process getting to know the API. The game ""loop""  takes a little getting used to, but once you're past that, anything is possible.Highly recommended for developers or if you want to learn how to program. Please note that the game tutorial is not intended to teach you how to program. For that you would need other resources.Oh, the hours on record only shows how much you started the Steam Screeps client, not how much you actually spend online."
911,2425,"There are many games out there that claim to improve your brain; increasing memory retention, attention to detail, improve problem solving and prodding creativity.  This game claims nothing of the sort but it could do so and be fully justified.It is not a game for people that dislike thinking about problems in depth or just want some light entertainment.  There are plenty of other games for that, rather it is a game that lets you stretch yourself and feel like you just got a tiny bit smarter for each new challenge that you solve on your quest to evolve your domain.I would reccommend this game to anyone interested in general programming, computer science, engineering, logic and World Domination.If you want to IMPROVE (not start from scratch) your knowledge of Javascript, this game is for you.If you want to build autonomous rovers, this game is for you.If you want to study data storage and retrieval, this game is for you.If thinking about pathfinding logic keeps you awake at night with excitement, this game is for you.If you like to plan out contingency scenarios, this game is for you.If a book on genetic algorithms sits dog-eared on your bookshelf, this game is for you.If you secretly harbour a desire to eliminate all life on the planet via murderous AI, this game is definitely for you."
912,2425,"Screeps is a great game with an awesome concept. The game requires you to program your vary own scripts to conquer the world. The game is easy to get into and has various in-depth elements that can be used by advanced users which requires some more thought.JavaScript programmers will instantly fall in love with the game, while non-programmers have a great learning opportunity. The game provides some basic tutorials explaining the mechanics and is great fun to play. There are many examples available online already, allowing you take a look into the strategy of other players. Screeps provide an in-game code editor, while it's also possible to use your own favorite IDE and version management.The game seems very well balanced, whether your scripts are small & simple or huge & complex, everyone has a chance. And best of all, your very own scripts run 24/7 on their servers without the need to leave the game open.Try out the demo online, for free.The only game it's legit to say in people are scripting. Worth every dollar!"

916,2424,Great game.
917,2424,Perfect.I love you.
918,2424,This is absolutely fantastic and a lot more deep than I expected. I can easily see myself playing this for many years to come.
919,2424,"There are two things I enjoy doing in life - playing video games and programming. This is a combination of the two. I've always enjoyed tower defense style games, which this is. In terms of the game, I don't really know what else to say; if you enjoy tower-defense games, MMOs and enjoy/want to get into programming then this fits all of those criteria with ease.So, on to the elephant in the room. The subscription model. In an era where subscriptions have almost been wiped out. I think subscriptions are heavily outdated and expensive, however in this case it is justified. After all, this game is clearly going to have a fairly small niche playerbase, and they have to run servers powerful enough to run everybody's code 24/7, so relying on income from sales alone is impractical.I also let the subscription model off for a big reason. Once the game releases from early access (1-2 months from now) the devs are open-sourcing the server and allowing anybody to host their own. In doing so, the subscription model is removed and you can try your AI against friends with as much power as you like (or have).The developers also seem to be very engaged with the community - due to its relatively small size they are able to respond to the majority or forum posts and many suggested features are added.For those who are put off by the standard MMO playerbases, this one is pretty civilised. Because they're programmers and not 12 year olds screaming into their microphone."
920,2424,"This game just makes me happy. I have been programming, on a basic level, while working towards my PhD and have been looking for a way to get better. I have dabbled in Unity and Unreal Engine 4, but when I saw this, I knew my search was over. I want to make it clear, that to do anything in this game, you must actually write JavaScript. This game was made for people with a love for programming of any skill level. They start you out with a great tutorial, imo. I have only completed the first 2 sections in my first hour of play, and I am loving it. If you have any interest in or love for programming, this will be a perfect game for you.Thank you to the developer. I tip my hat to you sir."

925,2424,One thing I've always loved is games that involve code and Screeps embraces this with a vengence.It has a serious learning curve and I suspect that 9-10 hours in I'm not even close to scratching the surface but I'm looking forward to delving deeper into what's on offer.probably not for the faint of coding heart but deeply rewarding for those who can stick with it.
926,2424,The best programming game I have ever played.I love optimizing my scripts and figuring out new ways to do things. I also like that my scripts simply run while I am away.

Actually I'll let my github activity chart speak for me: http://i.imgur.com/MaBBLLN.pngOn to the review. There is nothing else to compare this game to, it is a shiny gem sitting all alone in the genre it just made up. As the description talks about, your job is to program an AI to do your bidding in the world of Screeps. You are not alone. There are other AIs inhabiting this world, some programmed for evil, some for good, and some with tons of bugs (mine). If the idea of of a RTS MMO where you control your units, base, combat, and resource gathering 100% through code intrigues you, then you are exactly the type of player this game was made for.Pros:-Completely new game concept that appeals to programmers or people wanting to learn programming-Friendly community to pester with questions-Well-documented API-Balanced game mechanics that rewards more seasoned programmers without punishing newcomers-A chance to be a clever bastard with your coding skills-Best way imagineable to learn Javascript, if you've been meaning toCons:-Pricing structure might be a bit confusing, subscription is likely needed for MMO play-Early access game, occasional bugs, mostly cosmetic-Pretty steep learning curve that won't be forgiving for casual players or those who aren't really into programmingJust a word about the pricing. Basically you are paying to have your code run 24/7 on a remote server. In light of this, the 10 free CPU is fairly generous and would be enough to have a smaller-scale operation in the game world. Half of the fun is optimizing your code, so it would be possible to participate and enjoy the MMO from that angle. But if you want to be a kingpin in the MMO world, you are going to want a subscription, plain and simple. It isn't like Guild Wars where you buy once and have lifetime access AND be on the same footing as everyone else. I think the devs could be a bit more clear on that.If you don't know Javascript, you are probably wondering if you should even try. Learning Javascript was actually the main reason I was interested in this game. I can't think of a more engaging way to learn a new coding language. I wish the had a game like this for all the languages I wanted to learn/maintain. There are nicely padded novice areas where you can start and learn at your own pace.If your main interest is the RTS elements and you are hoping the coding thing won't get in the way, you'll probably want to avoid this game. You'll easily spend 1/3 of your time in a text editor/IDE, 1/3 observing the game world, and 1/3 in the IRC chat asking questions or looking things up in the API. If that actually sounds FUN to you, get this game right away.edit: as another reviewer mentioned, there is a risk-free way to find out if this game is right for you, you can do the tutorial at https://www.screeps.com/"
