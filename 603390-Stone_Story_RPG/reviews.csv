It's an enjoyable experience, and I have to praise the ASCII art which sets it apart from pretty much every other game out there, aside from a few other equally obscure games.Something I would criticize would be that eventually it's no different from an idle game, as once you read the end (of early access at the moment), you're essentially just farming a lot. The quest update gives some more story content, but in the end, the gameplay eventually devolves into pure farming, as there's nothing else to do.Of course, it's still early access and incomplete, so the lack of content is understandable and not valid (unless the end product remains relatively the same), so yeah.A rock-solid game."

603390,0,0,agerak,817,5,1,803.4,"June 26, 2021","This is definitely a hard game to categorize.  I have enjoyed it thoroughly and would recommend it to most people.In this game you control what equipment is used by your avatar, you do not directly control them hence the idle portion of the game.  That being said, once you get into the game and start to learn how the different mechanics work, you also unlock a scripting tool that allows you to program this behavior, automating your game play.  Also as you progress deeper you encounter new mechanics from enemies which require possible revision of your code, keeping you engaged.While it may sound simple, ""use dual wands if the enemy is far away"" or ""use a sword and shield if the enemy is close"" or ""dodge at this moment"", the fact that you can make intricate programs makes it quite fun and you can make some pretty amazing and complex optimizations to try and chase faster times.  This is definitely the core game play loop once you have beaten the story of the game.Graphics are what initially caught my eye in the vein of old school MUDs, aesthetic doesn't disappoint and it is all rendered very well including animations.  In addition, once you learn the scripting language you can create your own cosmetic designs from pets to UI elements or even costumes for your avatar or bosses.  Sound design also warrants a mention, it's phenomenal and really complements the graphic design perfectly.The developer is very active on discord, and welcomes player feedback which is very nice to see and keeps you engaged even between large content patches.  I've already seen multiple events since starting playing all of which have introduced new items, mechanics, and methods of play.  The community is active, especially around new content releases and myself and others check in almost daily to see if there are those with questions, or needing help working out code."

Which is rather boring. But the game works really well to offset that: for the first, like, 10 hours you are always unlocking new features and it really feels like making an actual progress. But then you beat what can be called the final boss and... yes, idle game there it is. You need 1024 1-lvl items to craft max-level item. So you make a basic weapon-swapping script and leave it for a few hours in the background. And then you initiate chest opening and wait 2-3 minutes (!) for item dropping animations to complete. And then you manually disassemble all this mess of items. And then you do it. Combine your 9lvl sword with 512 1-lvl swords and get your, IDK, maybe +5 DPS (haven't checked final level yet). Does it feel like success? Absolutely no. It's tedious. And there is an achievement for gathering 1 million of resources, IDK how much time it requires, maybe a month, maybe more.Well, do I recommend Stone Story? Yes, I do. There is nothing wrong with idle games and a lot of people like them. But for me - I would like to see more of an actual content, and in this direction development seems to be extremely slow. Or at least less ""meaningless time wasting"" parts, like disabling lots of animations you have to see on a regular basis."

603390,1,0,BlazeWarrior,270,32,1,94.8,"November 27, 2020","The scripting system in this game is extremely flexible and well made, it is a masterpiece.On the other hand, I dislike that the final boss is RNG-based :) What a really good game mechanic - 4* Dysangelos might have been the most unsatisfying fight I've ever had in my life. After about 20 attempts, 20 potions wasted, 3 days trying and 4 deaths with the boss having less than 1% HP left, I beat it and got absolutely nothing out of it, not even a chest. That just has to be the worst boss fight I've ever seen...After that I also just beat his 3rd form by accident, without even looking, which is way weaker than his 2nd form (4* area)... The balancing on the final boss is horribly off, really appaling.The offline algorithim is also really off in the beginning. It eventually gets a bit better but it feels glitchy and random, and even after many runs in a level it sometimes is still a bit unstable. It randomly oscilates between ""you can idle this for 8h just fine"" and ""you'd die like a fly in less than 3 minutes"" for apparently no reason."

There's lots of stuff you can do with Stonescript, and when you get down to brass tacks and understand how the game works, it's good fun! It also gets a TON of points for essentially being a very well made spiritual successor to Candy Box 1 and 2, easily two of the best old school idle games on the web.But I can't recommend this game. Not right now, even though it's already been over a year since launch. But there's realistically very little to this game, and even more disparagingly, an actually incredible lack of meaningful content. Sure, you can grind your way to the top, get your multi colored items and continue to fight your way to 15*'s of bosses, but is there really any point in doing so currently? I can't pick and choose over what kind of player you are, and if you'd enjoy games like this where you'd grind the same stages over and over getting similar loot, enhancing your own gear to get ~slightly~ better gear/enchantments, then this game is likely for you! But even when comparing to other games of this type, it's woefully unvaried (5 elements, 5 gear archetypes, around 3-4 tiers per archetype usually and they don't really upgrade much at all), and I have no genuine idea as to why? I know the dev is constantly active and does plenty of updates, but it feels, at least from an outsider perspective, that the game launched finished to their vision and they're only doing updates for long term support reasons. The bosses are genuinely frustrating some times, especially the last 3 you'll get to encounter, unless you make good use of Stonescript for automation purposes. Stonescript may save this game yet, but if custom ""overhaul-esque"" content can't be made in the future via Stonescript, then I can't see this game lasting remotely as long.I'll play more and see what I can find what else there is to the game, but I doubt my recommendation will change for a long while."

603390,41,0,blankdiploma,858,40,-1,5.4,"November 3, 2020","This game starts off incredibly strong. Almost every area you visit introduces a new resource and a new gameplay mechanic, keeping things fresh and interesting. It's a charming blend of an RPG and an idle game for the first hour or two.Then all of a sudden you hit a brick wall where there are no new features or resources introduced and the entire game devolves into grinding for gear to target elemental weaknesses in one of 5 nearly-identical zones. Grind aether gear so you can grind fire gear easier so you can grind ice gear easier so you can......... I would attribute this huge drop in quality to this being an Early Access game, but based off the patches that have been released so far, I have no confidence that this will change. The developer seems to be betting heavily on community mods to add meaningful new content - the Bethesda approach, if you will.At the end of the day, the weakest parts of the game are the ""semi-idle"" parts. You can't leave it AFK for long periods of time to get better gear because it needs to be CONSTANTLY baby-sat for no good reason. If you play manually, each time you start a zone you get healed to full. If you don't play manually, you do not heal to full, meaning you have to have vastly better gear just so you can leave the game alone for more than 90 seconds in a zone you can trivially complete. And even if you COULD idle earlier, all you'd be doing is exhausting the small amount of content in the game even quicker.The UI is also pointlessly time-wasting and frustrating. The number of clicks you need to do to re-forge your equipment to attack a different elemental weakness is enough to make you grind your teeth. Why can't I just swap a runestone in a sword with a different runestone instead of needing to go through multiple phases of deconstruct, deconstruct, merge, merge???Yes, I understand that the game includes an entire scripting language that you are meant to use to automate some of this tedium, but the problem is that you don't even get access to this language until you have seen 95% of the unique content the game has to offer. From what I can tell, once you unlock the automation ability, there is ONE additional boss and ZERO additional areas or game mechanics. You're just grinding for grinding's sake.I don't think ""you can go back and grind the same zones to higher tiers so you can fight the same bosses again except with more HP"" is nearly enough motivation to continue to engage with the game after you unlock the scripting language.I'll probably revisit this after a few years of early access to see if it has improved. For now, only buy this game on sale or if you DESPERATELY want to grind a small amount of repetitive content for hours."
603390,1,0,Edman1022,326,5,1,63.9,"October 19, 2020","There's a really solid base here that I think the developer can easily expand on to make a cool RPG. The player controls are relatively simple (you can only switch your equipped items), but the way that items can interact means that there's a lot of depth to actually optimizing your scripts, especially when it comes to taking down the bosses.The only major problem so far is that there aren't all that many different weapons with active abilities or more complicated effects. The game really shines when you have to figure out how to write a script to take advantage of these interactions. But it should be relatively easy for the developer to add more of these, since they shouldn't require any drastic modifications of the underlying game systems."

The unlocks as you go are engaging, too, with new game mechanics being unlocked regularly. All of that is great and is what lets me enjoy the game. But, with all that said, I find the gameplay to be fairly disengaging. I have very little experience with idle games but when a game gives me the feeling it doesnt need me and it will happily play itself I am left at a bit of a loss. In some areas there is a hint of more player interaction, with a need to swap weapons as your progress, as mentioned in the game description, to ensure you are ready for each enemy, but this is few and far between. I wouldnt even mind an emphasis on setup if the rounds were quicker and more dramatic. As it stands Stone Story RPG has an odd placidity. I appreciate this is still a work in progress, and I enjoyed my time playing it, but I really hope the RPG side gets extended and the player is given more chance to do things during combat."

You can also safely ignore any concerns you might have about an EA game being an unplayable buggy unfinished beta, this is essentially a complete indie game that you can play through the story from start to finish in around 8 hours and have a joyfully fun and challenging time throughout.At first glance it has a kind of quaint nostalgic feel of an old school choice and consequence adventure game, except now with added graphics! The artwork is phenomenal, the epitome of stylish, unpretentious minimalism. Gameplay predominantly focuses on scrolling combat/looting scenes culminating with a boss fight, after which you return to base and craft a variety of weapons and items to then access other parts of the world, defeat tough enemies, or access hidden loot. At times challenging, the game is generally not too tricky once you work out the crafting system and how to optimise combat. Switching weapons is at first a bit of a chore while scrolling along the levels not knowing what works well, but you'll eventually work out optimal methods for assigning hotkeys for certain weapon sets based on what you learn from each area.While fun and pretty much complete, the creators plans for the game go well beyond this. The plans during EA are to push for more community based content, including increased difficulty, more story/levels, endless modes etc, which is an interesting choice for an indie. Either way, if you just want a fleeting affair with a fun casual indie game, or want to be an active participant in driving development of what I imagine they hope to be an ever-present indie, then it's well worth a look."

After having spent the last couple of days playing it, getting the first tier of 5 stars on each level, and starting to dive into the automation scripting, I can say that it's absolutely worth the money. IMO there's plenty enough game here now to justify a $20 price point and, with some of the things the dev has hinted is coming down the line, I can imagine a future where that $20 is going to seem like a steal.

Aside from the beautiful art, animation and music, the combat is really interesting with different enemies that have different strategies to attack and have to be attacked in different way. The basic loop of the game is farm areas for materials, craft gear with the materials you craft, set up your loadout with the stuff you crafted, then send your guy with his new loadout to farm more materials.The crafting system is very satisfying and is loss-less, so you can craft things and break them apart again without losing any materials. It makes it very easy to fiddle, experiment and get lost in the different mechanics. There's not a huge depth in the system but there is enough to make it interesting and engaging.Overall great fun and game can't wait for upcoming content."

At first I thought my guy was moving automatically as part of a tutorial or intro sequence. But nope, that's how the game progresses. Once you understand the concept, it's actually pretty neat to see how they've set up each screen based around this auto-move/auto-act system.Switching around items while you're at a location is how you basically optimize or ""solve"" each run. (For example, if there's a tree, equip the axe to harvest wood. On the next screen, however, you might see enemies which are best taken out with range weapons, so you have to switch to a different loadout.) You can brute force your way through some of the earlier difficulties, but pretty quickly, you'll have to start experimenting with different equipment to ensure you survive a full location run.So far, it's been a great experience! The fact that the entire visual experience is rendered with ASCII symbols is insanely impressive. The sound design, music, and animations are top-notch.

Recent updates have added lovingly crafted story content (including new music and new characters), expanding the game world and lore. It's all very charming, and from a mechanical point of view, it's also a great way for new players to get the gear they need without having to grind as much. I really recommend checking out the quests if you are a returning player.Update (November 25th, 2020): Three huge improvements have been added to the game:- Offline farming has been added (so players don't have to leave the game running overnight).- New 'Lost Items' (powerful, rare pieces of equipment) have been introduced, enabling new strategies.- Stonescript has been expanded, allowing for even more complex programming and the ability to react to more things in the game state.Although I have farmed up several maximum-level enchantments, I still have plenty of work to do on my scripts to get optimal times on all of the levels. There's definitely still room for more experimentation, and I look forward to seeing what players create in Stonescript - especially any interesting new minigames.Update (March 4th, 2020): The Stonescript language has been greatly expanded, enabling players to create their own full-screen games and advanced mods that run inside of Stone Story RPG. There have been two Stonejams (game jams welcoming players to submit their original creations written in Stonescript). At this point, I've cleared all the Yellow Update content, but unlike before, I'm not left waiting for more base game content -- there are other players' creations to try out, and I'm learning from them to hopefully make my own.To be clear, I'm not a fan of idle games. I didn't play them before this one, and I'm not going to seek them out. I leave this game on because I'm able to loop levels unattended to farm better enchantments for my gear, and I have a soft goal of maxing out all of my gear. But it's nice to have a daily ritual of checking in, opening the gathered chests, getting the daily chests, and subtly improving my gear.--Update (November 5th, 2019): The Yellow Update landed in the beta branch, and it's fantastic. Five additional difficulty levels with new enemies, new behaviours for existing enemies, and an increased level cap. Very refreshing - I will need to change up my gear and strategies to beat these new challenges.--Update (October 1st, 2019): It's been over a month since I started, and I'm still actively playing and following the game's development via the public beta (a publicly available, opt-in version, separate from the main branch). The developer has been actively engaging with the community and incorporating feedback into his updates. The community on the official Discord has also been very helpful with sharing tips and strategies, especially for improving one's Stonescript.--This game is a real charmer. It's got its hooks into me real good.Stone Story RPG has an absolutely fantastic soundtrack, composed by Rafael Langoni Smith (who also created the similarly excellent soundtrack for SanctuaryRPG: Black Edition). His work is atmospheric, catchy, and a massive credit to the game.This game is, at first look, heavily based on the ""idle games"" genre. You collect gear, equip your character, and they automatically walk through levels, using a simple AI to pick up items and fight enemies. Despite the ASCII aesthetic, the interface is patterned after modern games, with large buttons making for a mouse-focused, keyboard-light control scheme.According to the lead developer (in a Steam forum post), this game was partly inspired by how MMO players would write bots to optimise their farming. That makes a lot of sense, because this game eventually presents its own internal scripting language (Stonescript), which can be used to change your character's loadout in response to the game state on a frame-perfect level (much like a TAS). I didn't expect this to become a programmer's game, and I was very pleasantly surprised. I should stress that the programming is optional; you can beat the game without ever using it, but it is there if you enjoy the challenge of using it to optimise your character's tactics.This game does involve grinding for resources, true to the ""idle"" genre. However, the boss encounters break up the monotony with a real challenge, as the player must switch their equipment loadout to deal with each boss monster's different behaviour patterns. In that sense, this isn't a pure ""idler"" (although, after a certain point, parts of it can be AFK farmed in the background, if one so wishes).It's also worthwhile to note that this is not a rogue-like (although it may visually resemble one); the levels are hand-crafted. It's a single-player RPG with an actual story. I've found its presentation thoroughly enchanting: surprisingly smooth ASCII animations, spot-on sound design, and perfectly mood-setting music make every scene richly evocative, and the quirky writing keeps me curious about the game's world.My only complaint is that, after passing the endgame and farming at high volume, inventory management gets cumbersome. (Crafting was previously also a drag, but has been improved after player feedback.) Other than that, I'm having a blast with this game in Early Access, and I'll continue to update my review if anything changes.If you like quirky, offbeat games that let you explore deep, mysterious worlds, with simple gameplay that gently unfurls to reveal more complex systems, give Stone Story RPG a try."

To me it plays much more like an idle clicker where the outcome changes for a given area depending on your equipment.  My first 10 minutes had me strongly considering requesting a refund, but I feel like i want to stick it out.What I can say for it is that the story is interesting so far and not just doled out for you on a platter and the art is a breath of fresh air. I do feel as though I have to keep playing it because I think it deserves a fair shot.Will update when I have some more hands on experience"

603390,4,0,76561198305992238,35,3,1,873.0,"August 10, 2019","My ONLY gripe with this game is that it labels itself as an RPG.This game focuses WAY more on the aspects of an IDLE game than an RPG, which leads to many people confused as they were expecting something else from this game.If you come in expecting an Idle game, you'll get a damn good one.If you come in expecting an RPG, you'll get a somewhat grindy, automatic one.Also, spoiler warning.Honestly, this game is pretty grind-based in the endgame. Early game starts incredibly fresh and you'll have to experiment with different item combinations to get through levels, and my god, the stones that you gradually unlock which add new features, are incredibly fun and rewarding. But once you've beaten ""The Temple"" (which appears to be the last real stage, from what I've found), you'll get the Mind Stone, and with that you'll have all of the stones, except for Moondial Stone, which you get from an endgame boss.The Mind Stone lets you harness the power of ""Stonescript"", which basically means you get to *program your character to do things that would normally be manual, or even impossible*. It's an incredibly refreshing idea and while currently limited, this IS an early access game, and the roadmap states lots of very powerful and fun features coming to it soon. It utilizes everything good about the ""automatic"" state of this Idle RPG and gives that power to you.Eventually, you'll upgrade one of the stones by painting it blue, which means you unlock a second tier to all levels. Normally you'd just start at 1 Star and work your way up to 5 Star, at which point you have ""finished"" the level and can replay it only to get more chests. But with the painted stone, you unlock a new tier of Blue Stars, that come after 5 White Stars, starting at 1 Blue Star up to 5 Blue Stars. My god, they are very difficult. You'll HAVE to grind at that point if you want to continue.But, the Mind Stone makes grinding less tedious than in any other old Idle game. You can program your character to do things frame-perfectly, to swap between items, dodge and weave through hordes of enemies, and optimize boss battles down to individual phases (with enough effort, of course!). Not to mention the Ouroboros Stone, which loops already completed levels so you can replay them infinitely without even touching a button... you have the power to program your own infinite level grinding machine!If you can get past it's flaws, this is an incredible Idle game that does things in a unique way and incorporates some fun RPG elements. It's hard to describe how I feel about this game, as I've not played through it 100% yet, but I certainly have enjoyed my time so far. 10/10 would ASCII again."

Throughout your adventures you will find swords, shields, runes, crossbows, and more; it's then up to the player to then find the best way to use these tools to craft better weapons and tools to get through the cruel world they find themselves in.  Graphics wise this is probably one of the most unique games I've seen in a long time given that it's art is made through ASCII characters.  It's got a certain charm to it and through it's art and animation alone is what sold me on this game.Sound design is really on point, one of the enemies you'll face in game is a bat, it might sound a little silly to say but, I was kinda blown away in it's sound design while the bat was flapping of its wings its sound matched with the animation.In short I'd say this game is very much worth picking up if you are into crafting tables and slight idle adventures."

After playing a bit more of the game I'd like to add that it's not just mindless sending your character charging in mindlessly like some clicker game, it actually takes some thought to figure out what to use and where to go next.Really enjoyable :)"

If you are looking for something to look at, something like a casual browser game with little clicking, but actually good production value, then this is it!But if you came here for exciting and engaging gameplay, you will be disapointed..It feels like a type of game that could be good if you want to chill a bit though.Works well for some. Not much for me unfortunately.Most of the game is essentially you choosing gear for a stickman, then sending it to a location where you sit and wait while you watch it gather resources and fight monsters. With no involvement from the player.You can also change equipment while watching your stickman run through whichever area it may be in.Choose a location, watch the stickman fight & pick up resources and loot. Rinse and repeat until you have enough resources to craft a canoe or whatever it is you need to explore further, or for your stickman to find the key to the next area.No penalty for dying.If I were to compare this to another style of game it would be those idler games where you send your adventurer out to gain gold. Then wait, and buy upgrades when you have enough gold.Cool enemies and boss fights become a boring drawn-out waiting-game. Because that's all you can do: sit and watch. And if you must find something for your fingers to do, you can pause the game and switch out your offhand for another kind of automated spellbook.In my own book; This is a point and click adventure. Where even the point and clicking is lacking.At least give me something to interact with while I watch the stickman do things. Like interact with the environment or something. Alter the landscape with my mouse, anything. But it's not my place to come up with ideas, it is to give my opinion.PS: I was about 2.5 hours in when I wrote the review. Was in offline-mode to get the most out of steam refunds."
