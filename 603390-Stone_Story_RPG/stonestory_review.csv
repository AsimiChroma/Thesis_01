1,2703,"I enjoy the story and discovering and unraveling the mysteries of this world, along with getting stronger and stronger. It's an enjoyable experience, and I have to praise the ASCII art which sets it apart from pretty much every other game out there, aside from a few other equally obscure games.Something I would criticize would be that eventually it's no different from an idle game, as once you read the end (of early access at the moment), you're essentially just farming a lot. The quest update gives some more story content, but in the end, the gameplay eventually devolves into pure farming, as there's nothing else to do.Of course, it's still early access and incomplete, so the lack of content is understandable and not valid (unless the end product remains relatively the same), so yeah.A rock-solid game."

3,2702,"An excellent game with a beautiful style. Great if you like idle games with a tinge of RPG. Seriously don't know how they got the style to work so well, it's  stunning."
4,2702," amazing. Not a single negative thing to say. Played off and on since buying and it was really enjoyable 'finishing' it multiple times. I'd say it's worth the buy, but how could you have missed that already? A free demo, beautifully animated graphics, cool encounters, amazing dialogue, GREAAAATTT music, and thrilling combat that I genuinely enjoyed no matter how repetitive losing any one fight became. Not to mention, they are still working on it and updating it frequently!p.s. - standardcombo (dev) has a youtube channel, where there's tutorials and time lapses on there of him making some sick ASCII graphics/animations. Check it out!"
5,2702,"Really cool art style, very relaxing to play... can't wait for the rest!"
6,2700,Great game! Will do a complete review once I complete it!
7,2698,This game is amazing.
8,2698,"(after playing for 10 minutes)""Oh FFS... this is an idle game. How did I miss that?""Dive into this cup of tea if you like that sort of click and wait stuff. It has a unique look and it's set up to be quite an interesting world.But if you prefer a more pro-active approach, you'll have to venture elsewhere."
9,2696,We expect to be in Early Access for about one year.
10,2695,"great gameplay, visual, and music :) loving it so far"
11,2693,"Stone Story RPG is a great game about adventures made in ASCII style. It has: good plot, great art style, many item interaction systems ({SPOILER ALERT}fusing, enchanting, converting, breaking ect.), {SPOILER ALERT}even its own programming languageand much, much more!If you liked anything that I said before, I reccomend you to buy this great game."
12,2693,Just get it
13,2692,"Admire the ASCII-Art style.The ""On the rails"" is what turns me off.I am debating as I type this if I'll be returning this game because of this.I hope with future updates you're able to move your character around instead of just watching the game play itself.P.S. I am leaving a negative recommendation, but I wish a more neutral indicator was left for people who don't dislike the game, but are annoyed with a specific mechanic that leaves you watching the game, bit playing the game."
14,2691,Awesome and impressive aesthetic
15,2688,perfect for someone but not for me
16,2688,;
17,2686, 10/10
18,2686,"This is definitely a hard game to categorize.  I have enjoyed it thoroughly and would recommend it to most people.In this game you control what equipment is used by your avatar, you do not directly control them hence the idle portion of the game.  That being said, once you get into the game and start to learn how the different mechanics work, you also unlock a scripting tool that allows you to program this behavior, automating your game play.  Also as you progress deeper you encounter new mechanics from enemies which require possible revision of your code, keeping you engaged.While it may sound simple, ""use dual wands if the enemy is far away"" or ""use a sword and shield if the enemy is close"" or ""dodge at this moment"", the fact that you can make intricate programs makes it quite fun and you can make some pretty amazing and complex optimizations to try and chase faster times.  This is definitely the core game play loop once you have beaten the story of the game.Graphics are what initially caught my eye in the vein of old school MUDs, aesthetic doesn't disappoint and it is all rendered very well including animations.  In addition, once you learn the scripting language you can create your own cosmetic designs from pets to UI elements or even costumes for your avatar or bosses.  Sound design also warrants a mention, it's phenomenal and really complements the graphic design perfectly.The developer is very active on discord, and welcomes player feedback which is very nice to see and keeps you engaged even between large content patches.  I've already seen multiple events since starting playing all of which have introduced new items, mechanics, and methods of play.  The community is active, especially around new content releases and myself and others check in almost daily to see if there are those with questions, or needing help working out code."
19,2684,fun little idle game
20,2683,very fun game
21,2680,"Amazing ASCII art style, with innovative and fun idle mechanics. A must play for fans of Idle Games or fans of ASCII art!!"
22,2678,Cool
23,2678,"Great relaxing game.One of my favorite mechanics of any game is being able to program an AI to play my character for me. I enjoy finding improving it and fixing weaknesses, as well as adapting the AI when my character unlocks new spells and abilities. This game does all that, so it's almost an automatic win for me. But it also has beautiful ASCII art and fun gameplay loops as a bonus, feels like that ""Candy Box"" idle game taken to a much higher level. Strongly recommend for any fans of idle games or programming games."
24,2677,"Well, for me it's quiet hard to evaluate Stone Story RPG. Because despite what store page says, it's still an idle game at it's core. Which is rather boring. But the game works really well to offset that: for the first, like, 10 hours you are always unlocking new features and it really feels like making an actual progress. But then you beat what can be called the final boss and... yes, idle game there it is. You need 1024 1-lvl items to craft max-level item. So you make a basic weapon-swapping script and leave it for a few hours in the background. And then you initiate chest opening and wait 2-3 minutes (!) for item dropping animations to complete. And then you manually disassemble all this mess of items. And then you do it. Combine your 9lvl sword with 512 1-lvl swords and get your, IDK, maybe +5 DPS (haven't checked final level yet). Does it feel like success? Absolutely no. It's tedious. And there is an achievement for gathering 1 million of resources, IDK how much time it requires, maybe a month, maybe more.Well, do I recommend Stone Story? Yes, I do. There is nothing wrong with idle games and a lot of people like them. But for me - I would like to see more of an actual content, and in this direction development seems to be extremely slow. Or at least less ""meaningless time wasting"" parts, like disabling lots of animations you have to see on a regular basis."
25,2676,yes
26,2673,A unique idle-style game with a great art style and sound track. Check it out if it looks interesting to you.
27,2667,"The main game is pretty short, about 4-5hrs but this is early access so there should be more updates in the future since I see plenty of space for story developmentAlso would be neat if we have something like a rogue mode and/or users contributed library for modding stages, cosmetics, macros, etc.Update: Just checked their Twitter, they already developing that, neat."
28,2666,'s good
29,2665,Just absolutely amazing
30,2662,astonishing astounding surprising bewildering stunning staggering shocking startling stupefying breathtaking perplexing confounding dismaying disconcerting shattering awesome awe-inspiring sensational remarkable spectacular stupendous phenomenal prodigious extraordinary incredible unbelievable wonderful marvelous thrilling exciting mind-blowing flabbergasting amazeballs wondrous dumbfounding
31,2662,Stone Story RPG has a hook. And I'm not talking about the grappling hook in-game. I'm talking about that underlying hook that makes you wanna keep playing the game to find out what happens next. I rarely encounter this hook in games today. But when I do it seems to happen in the most unlikely of places. And in this particular case it was down in the caves and forests of Stone Story RPG!
32,2660,i liked the style of this game .everything  looks like in 1990 game my rate -   9/10
33,2660,goodalso the upgraded ouroboros stone is a bit bugged
34,2660,"Easy to run on Mac, simple and sweet. Great game concept as I am a poet. Using words and letters is such a way is pure art. Very satisfied with this game."
35,2656,"I've had buyers remorse for a lot of games because I'm extremely picky yet very easy to please, it's hell.This game has been incredible and charming.  Please give it a chance. There's even a demo which is just a small taste of what the game turns into."
36,2656,"I don't understand programming, but I think I'm having fun."
37,2656,"I'm really enjoying this game! It's awesome to see the, 'A Dark Room,' genre of games begin to really flesh out. Even though it's labeled idle, you will certainly be interacting with the game while you play it. I highly recommend this title!!!"
38,2656,"The scripting system in this game is extremely flexible and well made, it is a masterpiece.On the other hand, I dislike that the final boss is RNG-based :) What a really good game mechanic - 4* Dysangelos might have been the most unsatisfying fight I've ever had in my life. After about 20 attempts, 20 potions wasted, 3 days trying and 4 deaths with the boss having less than 1% HP left, I beat it and got absolutely nothing out of it, not even a chest. That just has to be the worst boss fight I've ever seen...After that I also just beat his 3rd form by accident, without even looking, which is way weaker than his 2nd form (4* area)... The balancing on the final boss is horribly off, really appaling.The offline algorithim is also really off in the beginning. It eventually gets a bit better but it feels glitchy and random, and even after many runs in a level it sometimes is still a bit unstable. It randomly oscilates between ""you can idle this for 8h just fine"" and ""you'd die like a fly in less than 3 minutes"" for apparently no reason."
39,2655,Great game. That's it. Also the music and sounds are incredible. Reminds me of Candybox.
40,2655,"Once again Steam not allowing a middle ground for review personal recommendations hurts making for a real review process.I like this game, it has a lot of effort and love put in to it, lots of merits, a great soundtrack and it has absolutely gorgeous use of ASCII for its art and design. There's lots of stuff you can do with Stonescript, and when you get down to brass tacks and understand how the game works, it's good fun! It also gets a TON of points for essentially being a very well made spiritual successor to Candy Box 1 and 2, easily two of the best old school idle games on the web.But I can't recommend this game. Not right now, even though it's already been over a year since launch. But there's realistically very little to this game, and even more disparagingly, an actually incredible lack of meaningful content. Sure, you can grind your way to the top, get your multi colored items and continue to fight your way to 15*'s of bosses, but is there really any point in doing so currently? I can't pick and choose over what kind of player you are, and if you'd enjoy games like this where you'd grind the same stages over and over getting similar loot, enhancing your own gear to get ~slightly~ better gear/enchantments, then this game is likely for you! But even when comparing to other games of this type, it's woefully unvaried (5 elements, 5 gear archetypes, around 3-4 tiers per archetype usually and they don't really upgrade much at all), and I have no genuine idea as to why? I know the dev is constantly active and does plenty of updates, but it feels, at least from an outsider perspective, that the game launched finished to their vision and they're only doing updates for long term support reasons. The bosses are genuinely frustrating some times, especially the last 3 you'll get to encounter, unless you make good use of Stonescript for automation purposes. Stonescript may save this game yet, but if custom ""overhaul-esque"" content can't be made in the future via Stonescript, then I can't see this game lasting remotely as long.I'll play more and see what I can find what else there is to the game, but I doubt my recommendation will change for a long while."
41,2653,p' gud
42,2652,"This game starts off incredibly strong. Almost every area you visit introduces a new resource and a new gameplay mechanic, keeping things fresh and interesting. It's a charming blend of an RPG and an idle game for the first hour or two.Then all of a sudden you hit a brick wall where there are no new features or resources introduced and the entire game devolves into grinding for gear to target elemental weaknesses in one of 5 nearly-identical zones. Grind aether gear so you can grind fire gear easier so you can grind ice gear easier so you can......... I would attribute this huge drop in quality to this being an Early Access game, but based off the patches that have been released so far, I have no confidence that this will change. The developer seems to be betting heavily on community mods to add meaningful new content - the Bethesda approach, if you will.At the end of the day, the weakest parts of the game are the ""semi-idle"" parts. You can't leave it AFK for long periods of time to get better gear because it needs to be CONSTANTLY baby-sat for no good reason. If you play manually, each time you start a zone you get healed to full. If you don't play manually, you do not heal to full, meaning you have to have vastly better gear just so you can leave the game alone for more than 90 seconds in a zone you can trivially complete. And even if you COULD idle earlier, all you'd be doing is exhausting the small amount of content in the game even quicker.The UI is also pointlessly time-wasting and frustrating. The number of clicks you need to do to re-forge your equipment to attack a different elemental weakness is enough to make you grind your teeth. Why can't I just swap a runestone in a sword with a different runestone instead of needing to go through multiple phases of deconstruct, deconstruct, merge, merge???Yes, I understand that the game includes an entire scripting language that you are meant to use to automate some of this tedium, but the problem is that you don't even get access to this language until you have seen 95% of the unique content the game has to offer. From what I can tell, once you unlock the automation ability, there is ONE additional boss and ZERO additional areas or game mechanics. You're just grinding for grinding's sake.I don't think ""you can go back and grind the same zones to higher tiers so you can fight the same bosses again except with more HP"" is nearly enough motivation to continue to engage with the game after you unlock the scripting language.I'll probably revisit this after a few years of early access to see if it has improved. For now, only buy this game on sale or if you DESPERATELY want to grind a small amount of repetitive content for hours."
43,2650,"There's a really solid base here that I think the developer can easily expand on to make a cool RPG. The player controls are relatively simple (you can only switch your equipped items), but the way that items can interact means that there's a lot of depth to actually optimizing your scripts, especially when it comes to taking down the bosses.The only major problem so far is that there aren't all that many different weapons with active abilities or more complicated effects. The game really shines when you have to figure out how to write a script to take advantage of these interactions. But it should be relatively easy for the developer to add more of these, since they shouldn't require any drastic modifications of the underlying game systems."
44,2650,"mostly grind, not enough content to cover cost"
45,2649,It's an elaborate incremental game similar to something like A Dark Room or Candybox 1/2. Very cool art
46,2649,Play Candy Box 2 instead
47,2644,"You explore things for yourself and feel like a badass, even if it's all thanks to subtly smart game design - the best kind of RPG.It looks beautiful. The use of only ASCII characters isn't religious, but it certainly does enough to create a very unique retro aesthetic.A <REDACTED> play style slowly emerges, which makes for a delightful end-game experience."
48,2643,I like this game
49,2642,"Amazingly beautiful game if a bit linear. So far, pretty enjoyable though."
50,2641,"Didnt know what i was looking at at first, but the more i looked at it, the more intrigued i got. Most fun ive had in a game in a while, got super immersed into the style, and for this game being my FIRST ever coding experience ever im already trying to script automation for other games as we speak! 10/10 would play for weeks on end"
51,2639,fun
52,2639,"hella sick, addicting"
53,2638,BEST GAME I EVER PLAYEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEED!
54,2634,"Stone Story RPG nails what an ASCII Idle RPG has to offer.On top of that, it has a super healthy community with involved devs who try to make the game better and better.Give it a try, you won't regret it ^^"
55,2634,"""Did I ever tell you what the definition of insanity is"" -vaas after getting a copy of this game"
56,2634,best game ever. what i most like is the mind stone that allows you to program your afk farming\o/
57,2632,"The artwork is gorgeous and perhaps the best ASCII art I have ever seen. The setting is interesting and varied and the characters are distinct. The unlocks as you go are engaging, too, with new game mechanics being unlocked regularly. All of that is great and is what lets me enjoy the game. But, with all that said, I find the gameplay to be fairly disengaging. I have very little experience with idle games but when a game gives me the feeling it doesnt need me and it will happily play itself I am left at a bit of a loss. In some areas there is a hint of more player interaction, with a need to swap weapons as your progress, as mentioned in the game description, to ensure you are ready for each enemy, but this is few and far between. I wouldnt even mind an emphasis on setup if the rounds were quicker and more dramatic. As it stands Stone Story RPG has an odd placidity. I appreciate this is still a work in progress, and I enjoyed my time playing it, but I really hope the RPG side gets extended and the player is given more chance to do things during combat."
58,2631,"I've been looking around for quite some time for a game that does not distract me from more important aspects of life, but also scratches the progression itch that unfortunately is a permanent part of me.  Designing the automation scripting is extremely fun, and what a unique thing to put in an idle game.  I feel like I'm actively trying new things to further streamline my runs for maximum efficiency.  The art is so damn cool and the gameplay is way deeper than I expected.  Great job"
59,2631,"this game is amazing. it has some of the best ascii art out there. the game can get a bit hard at times, but its nice. best game. 9/10"
60,2629,This was a surprisingly charming romp.  It didn't take too long but I could see how it could.
61,2626,"Stone Story RPG is currently an Early Access game that sits as a shining example of what Early Access games can and should be like. You can also safely ignore any concerns you might have about an EA game being an unplayable buggy unfinished beta, this is essentially a complete indie game that you can play through the story from start to finish in around 8 hours and have a joyfully fun and challenging time throughout.At first glance it has a kind of quaint nostalgic feel of an old school choice and consequence adventure game, except now with added graphics! The artwork is phenomenal, the epitome of stylish, unpretentious minimalism. Gameplay predominantly focuses on scrolling combat/looting scenes culminating with a boss fight, after which you return to base and craft a variety of weapons and items to then access other parts of the world, defeat tough enemies, or access hidden loot. At times challenging, the game is generally not too tricky once you work out the crafting system and how to optimise combat. Switching weapons is at first a bit of a chore while scrolling along the levels not knowing what works well, but you'll eventually work out optimal methods for assigning hotkeys for certain weapon sets based on what you learn from each area.While fun and pretty much complete, the creators plans for the game go well beyond this. The plans during EA are to push for more community based content, including increased difficulty, more story/levels, endless modes etc, which is an interesting choice for an indie. Either way, if you just want a fleeting affair with a fun casual indie game, or want to be an active participant in driving development of what I imagine they hope to be an ever-present indie, then it's well worth a look."
62,2625,"I'd been putting off buying this for a while because even though the ASCII art is extremely impressive and I love incremental games, spending $20 on an early access incremental game seemed absolutely absurd to me. After having spent the last couple of days playing it, getting the first tier of 5 stars on each level, and starting to dive into the automation scripting, I can say that it's absolutely worth the money. IMO there's plenty enough game here now to justify a $20 price point and, with some of the things the dev has hinted is coming down the line, I can imagine a future where that $20 is going to seem like a steal. Really and truly, I can see a point coming in the dev cycle of this game where people start pointing to it as the epitome of what well-designed, premium incremental games can become."
63,2625,My name is Bob Ross and I recommend this game.
64,2624,It good
65,2622,"This game is absolutely amazing!!  I haven't played anything like it.The art style and soundtrack are unique, the plot and world-building is compelling, the core game-play is enjoyable. I highly recommend checking this out!"
66,2622,"This game is so well done! It's polished, cute, and has amazing art!"
67,2620,Great game
68,2617,"Great incremental game mixed with crafting. Aside from the beautiful art, animation and music, the combat is really interesting with different enemies that have different strategies to attack and have to be attacked in different way. The basic loop of the game is farm areas for materials, craft gear with the materials you craft, set up your loadout with the stuff you crafted, then send your guy with his new loadout to farm more materials.The crafting system is very satisfying and is loss-less, so you can craft things and break them apart again without losing any materials. It makes it very easy to fiddle, experiment and get lost in the different mechanics. There's not a huge depth in the system but there is enough to make it interesting and engaging.Overall great fun and game can't wait for upcoming content."
69,2617,"Good core game loop. Little content, but future development promises to remedy that."
70,2616,like a console game
71,2615,love the art and music
72,2613,"It's a tad confusing at first. Your character always moves and acts (for the most part) on their own. So you can't control movement directly. At first I thought my guy was moving automatically as part of a tutorial or intro sequence. But nope, that's how the game progresses. Once you understand the concept, it's actually pretty neat to see how they've set up each screen based around this auto-move/auto-act system.Switching around items while you're at a location is how you basically optimize or ""solve"" each run. (For example, if there's a tree, equip the axe to harvest wood. On the next screen, however, you might see enemies which are best taken out with range weapons, so you have to switch to a different loadout.) You can brute force your way through some of the earlier difficulties, but pretty quickly, you'll have to start experimenting with different equipment to ensure you survive a full location run.So far, it's been a great experience! The fact that the entire visual experience is rendered with ASCII symbols is insanely impressive. The sound design, music, and animations are top-notch. If you're looking for a unique gaming experience (I sure was), then give this game a try!"
73,2613,"I like this game so much that i even bought one copy as a gift for my best friend!!!I think I will do all that I could do to support this game in the future because this game's developper, standardcombo, still updating the features of this game and giving our faithful players tons of surprise!!About the game, it has a super cool ascii animation which is already fascinating, but the core fun and exitement of this game, as a 4k hours players, I could tell you it's the programming, yean, you are not hearing wrong, stonescript, as a inside coding language in this game, allowing you to do many things like autoatk, cool cosmetics and even interesting games!!!"
74,2612,Better than an ordinary idle game
75,2612,"cross between idle and non idle rpg. Its fun, but currently needs more content.*EDIT* So its been in early access for a year and a half since I last wrote that review. I came back to it now and nothing appears to be different. I see NO new content. Dont buy this."
76,2611,"Great art style, poor gameplay.I enjoyed the ASCII art style, but frankly, the player running for you and you clicking on things isn't great gameplay, even though it wants to be some type of ""Set your load out and get going"" type of game, there's very little player involvement.A great art style unfortunately can't cover up poor game design choices.Perhaps in the future, as the game develops, it will improve and so will my score."
77,2609,"Beautiful, incremental, fun!"
78,2608,"Amazing graphics, awesome soundtrackI highly recommend this game"
79,2608,"I wouldn't recommend if you come for the fantasinating RPG story line as the game was titled, for that it barely has one. Besides, you won't get a positive experience of player involvement and smooth operations.But I would hugely recommend for the beautiful ASCII art in it. (It could be somehow called ""ASCII HD"".) Also, if you are interested in idle/farming/clicking games and have a potential ""compulsive hoarding"", just buy it, sit back and relax to watch the stick man fighting the enemies and collecting plenty of miraculous loots....Some hidden messages and a great sense of humour are also placed in this game. You won't get bored at the early stage with the world unfolding. There's even a custom automate system to let you write your own scripts to manipulate the automatic movement of the stick man. Fair enough... basically here's simple mine: if hp<10: drink potion.Of course, you will soon get bored after hours of playing, well... but you just can't stop playing it any more...(I got a beta version from the author last year and really into the art at the first glance. Now it's released and still in early access, staying tuned and expecting more.)"
80,2608,Fun and addicting! just one more turn kind of game. Highly recommended!
81,2607,"I expected MORE from this game when I saw the first moments of gameplay. I thought it was a game like a playbook RPG where you made the decisions for the hero and build your own adventure.I was wrong.however the game is still really great for its diversification, creativity and amazing animation effects with the ASCII art.You can always come cameback to a previous scenarios at anytime and collect more resources, more items or just increase your power level."
82,2606,Yes
83,2606,it is very good
84,2605,"Feels almost like some sort of prequel to Candy Box 2. Incredible art style and good progression; you usually make progress in chunks and you'd have to idle the previous levels in the meantime if you want to progress later on. Fortunately because of how easy it is to run this game you can easily leave this game running 24/7 without any major performance issues, even when playing other demanding games."
85,2605,I think this game is great. I just with I had more and more content. the scripting thing is awesome. it would be even better if you could some how like record a play through and get those commands recorded to script the autorun feature.
86,2604,"Very shallow on the gameplay side, but is excellent for playing while eating a meal. I'm not kidding. Pick out a weapon and then watch the violence unfold while you eat. The ASCII art animations are top notch and if you think you might enjoy that, go ahead and check it out."
87,2604,"Once you get through the initial grind, then its all about refining your code to max out efficiency. Their discord people are very helpful and fun."
88,2604,"Fun, idle RPG. scripting actions adds interesting strategic/puzzle depth, could be very engaging if community made levels, etc. are implemented."
89,2604,Very nice Art style and simplistic yet addicting gameplay
90,2604,"This game is breathtaking. It is a perfect way to relax and unwind, as the game is less about sudden quick movements, but choosing the parameters and watching the game play out. I love it for this. The art style is just amazing. The pacing is really good too. If you just want to grind a bit, you can do that. If you want to progress the story, you can do that too. Overall I loved this game.Also thank you for supporting Linux!"
91,2604,A stunning game that kept me hooked for days.
92,2604,"Chill, casual, pleasing and visually rewarding game."
93,2604,Probably one of the most unique rpgs Ive ever played. Art style is beautiful and its worth buying just for that and the music.
94,2603,ASCII? Check.RPG Elements? Check.Sometimes humorous situations? Check.Kickass music? Check.Honestly? Get it.
95,2603,Stone
96,2603,"The game is a fun and novel experience if you don't mind grinding to explore some of its more intricate mechanics. Combat is ultimately pretty simple but allows for relatively deep engagements through gear selection impacting the flow of the fight based on enemy behaviour and range.Grind aside, while I recommend the game as an experience, I don't currently recommend it as a full-price purchase."
97,2603,This game is a good play if you want something simple yet complex at the same time
98,2603,charming if you dont mind grinding
99,2603,"Saw this game on youtubeI am a fan of ""idle games"" and thought ""What could go wrong""Just have to say that this game is fun to play aloneOr when you're on a discord call and just chatting and battling away"
100,2603,Good game.Hope stone script gets better.
101,2602,"This is an awesome little gem!Has some RPG, incremental game and even a bit of programming, love it and the ASCII artstyle!"
102,2600,Beautiful
103,2600,"A beautifully made and thought out indie title. It has all the addictive and relaxing qualities of a browser game, but if feels so deep. The art is stunning. I was expecting more rpg elements, rather than just a series of simulated combats, but so far that hasn't stopped me from loading this game up about 8 times today. What has me coming back for more is the quality of the game design. It's intoxicating."
104,2600,The ascii art of this game is beautiful and it's more challenging than I expected. Super adorable and fun to play.
105,2598,"Stone with a body, what you mean about that?"
106,2596,"this isn't a rant, I like this game, I just want more reasons to continue on with this game, like: more lore than the current ones? continue further if you're feeling like reading something very long AND getting the game spoiled for youcan you plz extend the story? because, I'd love to see what the acropolis is like, since you can make MAGIC in this game, then you'd definitely be able to figure out a way to fly, right? maybe include a new build that requires large amounts of all the resources you can collect throughout the game, and make it the way you can ""ascend"" to acropolis, or maybe some other way, since the word ""ascend"" can point to different types of ascend, maybe increasing your some sort of ""allowance""? to be able to ""access"" acropolis? just don't leave what acropolis is a mystery for too long, or some youtubers will start making assumptions on ""what is the acropolis"", or taking it even further, assuming the origins of the players' avatar or something like that. please make the lore a bit longer, so there's more to be discovered/spoiled."
107,2594,very unique game
108,2593,This is a very simplistic game that has great mechanics and a very great concept to it as well. This game does prove the fact that you don't need amazing graphics to make a fantastic game. 10/10
109,2593,This game is brilliant.  It's a refined incremental game like Paperclips meets the best of a mobile AFK RPG in a totally amazing combo.  It unfolds several times to reveal significant new depth.  I'd avoid FAQs when initially playingt if I were you to preserve some mystery around mechanics.
110,2593,"TDLR:Definitely a unique game, a bit simplistic, but crafted with love and immense attention to detail. 8.5 / 10Stone Story has touched me in its special retro-charming way.Despite the simple story, the game feels a lot like heroic tale or a myth, more so than Skyrim or other similar game.Sound design and ""cutscenes"" stenghten this impression.Can't imagine how many hours has been put into design and art.The devs have put an incredible amount of polish and attention into crafting sprites and animations. It's fun how characters you see every day like "" , 8 ' - < > come together and form a living, moving thing.The game system is simplistic, but unique: not sure it's right to put RPG in its name. The resources still have significance at each point of the story and provide different benefits. Crafting system is fun enough. If you want a challenge, 4 and 5+star difficulties will make you scratch your head and come up with a tactic utilizing different items."
111,2592,"this game is beautiful to behold. it has a fascinating play mechanic that is a little bit more complex than you might first expect as bosses and certain enemies cannot be beat without swapping certain weapons in and out. the crafting system is a major part of it, so fair warning if you are not the biggest fan of crafting. what raises the game from merely good to in my opinion very good indeed is the atmosphere created from the gorgeous ascii graphics and lovely soundtrack."
112,2591,ascii art at its finestgreat story and RPG elementscant wait for standardcombo to continue development
113,2590,high quality graphics
114,2590,Amazing little grindy RPG!
115,2589,"A unique game that seems simple at first, but really evolves as you continue to play.  Give it more than a few hours to really see its' potential."
116,2589,Wow! when you beat Temple 4... something very unexpected happens!This game is very good! Darkest Dungeon has many things to learn from this.Just have a bit of patience at start and then start learning and enjoying.
117,2589,"I am fond of games with ASCII animation/art. I was able to finish this game for only about 2-3 hours. So, what now? I thought that the game would be boring afterwards because it was too repetitive but boy, was I wrong.  I was really into this mechanic/feature which is accessible once you've unlocked/obtained the 'Mind Stone'. It is very fun and interesting to use because it is similar to programming. You can basically set the rules based on the current game state so that you can leave your PC to grind while you do other stuff. I really love games that you have to grind and at the same time, I love how programming was incorporated into this game. 10/10 ""A pleasure as usual. Haste ye back for more  treasure """
118,2589,fun
119,2589,"This game is a strikingly original piece of work. Although there are many games that use ASCII graphics in the rogue-like world, few use them in such a visually appealing way (I'm looking at you, Dwarf Fortress.). This game is part simulation and part movie. You equip yourself to the best of your ability and try to bash through a level based on that. 10/10 for the Celtic skull shell game! Would win a set of forward slashes again!"
120,2589,"I know its most likely an early access bug, but losing all my progress when I quit and went back in wasn't fun. I might have another look once it comes out of early access."
121,2588,"This game is the more fleshed out version of candy box that i always wanted. its  got a complex progression system for  what essentially amounts to an idle game.  add on top of that the light programming you can do later on it manages to make AFK farming something feel satisfying, because you wrote the script to do the farm, it feels earned rather than given, especially for some of the more complex fights (namely in the mines)"
122,2588,"This game has a great art style (its main selling point), surprisingly good sound and music, and elicits a few chuckles in its limited storyline.However I wouldn't buy it as-is.  Extremely limited content (with only the promise of more) and limited play style that almost requires afk grinding.Crafting is limited and very much like mobile games where you can combine X similar items to get an incremental upgrade, and if you grind for weeks you might be able to get an item that's suitable for only one area.I also dabbled in Stonescript which can help automate situational item switching which was fine, but again grinding for days in the background isn't my idea of endgame fun.For its price I expected a game with a few more layers of depth; I only got about a quarter of what I expected and low replay value.  The roadmap for future development also wasn't too promising: more levels, more grinding... I can't recommend it."
123,2588,"I like the game. It starts off very simple, and adds features naturally as the story progresses. It ends up quite complex, in a good way."
124,2588,i love it
125,2588,Simple but beautiful aesthetics.Also later on you can write scripts to automate farming.
126,2588,"Oui c'est un  ""genre"" de idle game mais si vous voulez de l'originalit dans un jeu essayer stone story"
127,2588,sensacional
128,2588,"(note: made some edits as I discovered stuff)Stone Story RPG == a great idle/incremental game with RPG trappings.  (edit: and programming!?)I bought this on a whim purely due to the ASCII art aesthetic; I'm a couple hours in, and I'm enjoying it way more than I expected -- this is a delightful, extremely chill little game. No rough edges whatsoever despite the Early Access tag.This may make my top 10 for the year, I'm enjoying it that much.Edit 2: omg when you unlock the coding ability, the only way for your scripts to save state is to write literal expressions onto your blank face. FACIAL EXPRESSIONS. o_O"
129,2588,"This game is fantastic and hard to explain. I admit that I only bought it because the art looked amazing, but I'm totally hooked now."
130,2588,"What a great game... It just gets better and better the more you play it. Not because it gets more fun, but because you're unlocking more and more of the gameplay. it starts off with just clicking, then you get hotkeys, and options, and if I say anything more I'm going into spoiler territory, but just know that by the time you beat the game, you've probably done some pretty cool stuff."
131,2588,"Im not mad, Im just disappointed.Stone Story has the potential to be a truly great game as the art style and music are perfect, but sadly there overshadowed by the fact that it basically plays like a mobile game. You can't move your character, he will just walk forward and pick up items. You can't control what you attack, he will just attack what's closest to him. All you do is select a level, sit back, and let the game play itself. You may get to chose what weapon you use, but that's it...JUST LET ME CONTROL THE DAME CHARACTER."
132,2588,It's is a really hard game but if you start to understand the gimmick you are going to like it
133,2588,"Update (October 3, 2021): The Quest system is finally live, and it's fantastic. Recent updates have added lovingly crafted story content (including new music and new characters), expanding the game world and lore. It's all very charming, and from a mechanical point of view, it's also a great way for new players to get the gear they need without having to grind as much. I really recommend checking out the quests if you are a returning player.Update (November 25th, 2020): Three huge improvements have been added to the game:- Offline farming has been added (so players don't have to leave the game running overnight).- New 'Lost Items' (powerful, rare pieces of equipment) have been introduced, enabling new strategies.- Stonescript has been expanded, allowing for even more complex programming and the ability to react to more things in the game state.Although I have farmed up several maximum-level enchantments, I still have plenty of work to do on my scripts to get optimal times on all of the levels. There's definitely still room for more experimentation, and I look forward to seeing what players create in Stonescript - especially any interesting new minigames.Update (March 4th, 2020): The Stonescript language has been greatly expanded, enabling players to create their own full-screen games and advanced mods that run inside of Stone Story RPG. There have been two Stonejams (game jams welcoming players to submit their original creations written in Stonescript). At this point, I've cleared all the Yellow Update content, but unlike before, I'm not left waiting for more base game content -- there are other players' creations to try out, and I'm learning from them to hopefully make my own.To be clear, I'm not a fan of idle games. I didn't play them before this one, and I'm not going to seek them out. I leave this game on because I'm able to loop levels unattended to farm better enchantments for my gear, and I have a soft goal of maxing out all of my gear. But it's nice to have a daily ritual of checking in, opening the gathered chests, getting the daily chests, and subtly improving my gear.--Update (November 5th, 2019): The Yellow Update landed in the beta branch, and it's fantastic. Five additional difficulty levels with new enemies, new behaviours for existing enemies, and an increased level cap. Very refreshing - I will need to change up my gear and strategies to beat these new challenges.--Update (October 1st, 2019): It's been over a month since I started, and I'm still actively playing and following the game's development via the public beta (a publicly available, opt-in version, separate from the main branch). The developer has been actively engaging with the community and incorporating feedback into his updates. The community on the official Discord has also been very helpful with sharing tips and strategies, especially for improving one's Stonescript.--This game is a real charmer. It's got its hooks into me real good.Stone Story RPG has an absolutely fantastic soundtrack, composed by Rafael Langoni Smith (who also created the similarly excellent soundtrack for SanctuaryRPG: Black Edition). His work is atmospheric, catchy, and a massive credit to the game.This game is, at first look, heavily based on the ""idle games"" genre. You collect gear, equip your character, and they automatically walk through levels, using a simple AI to pick up items and fight enemies. Despite the ASCII aesthetic, the interface is patterned after modern games, with large buttons making for a mouse-focused, keyboard-light control scheme.According to the lead developer (in a Steam forum post), this game was partly inspired by how MMO players would write bots to optimise their farming. That makes a lot of sense, because this game eventually presents its own internal scripting language (Stonescript), which can be used to change your character's loadout in response to the game state on a frame-perfect level (much like a TAS). I didn't expect this to become a programmer's game, and I was very pleasantly surprised. I should stress that the programming is optional; you can beat the game without ever using it, but it is there if you enjoy the challenge of using it to optimise your character's tactics.This game does involve grinding for resources, true to the ""idle"" genre. However, the boss encounters break up the monotony with a real challenge, as the player must switch their equipment loadout to deal with each boss monster's different behaviour patterns. In that sense, this isn't a pure ""idler"" (although, after a certain point, parts of it can be AFK farmed in the background, if one so wishes).It's also worthwhile to note that this is not a rogue-like (although it may visually resemble one); the levels are hand-crafted. It's a single-player RPG with an actual story. I've found its presentation thoroughly enchanting: surprisingly smooth ASCII animations, spot-on sound design, and perfectly mood-setting music make every scene richly evocative, and the quirky writing keeps me curious about the game's world.My only complaint is that, after passing the endgame and farming at high volume, inventory management gets cumbersome. (Crafting was previously also a drag, but has been improved after player feedback.) Other than that, I'm having a blast with this game in Early Access, and I'll continue to update my review if anything changes.If you like quirky, offbeat games that let you explore deep, mysterious worlds, with simple gameplay that gently unfurls to reveal more complex systems, give Stone Story RPG a try."
134,2588,"My ONLY gripe with this game is that it labels itself as an RPG.This game focuses WAY more on the aspects of an IDLE game than an RPG, which leads to many people confused as they were expecting something else from this game.If you come in expecting an Idle game, you'll get a damn good one.If you come in expecting an RPG, you'll get a somewhat grindy, automatic one.Also, spoiler warning.Honestly, this game is pretty grind-based in the endgame. Early game starts incredibly fresh and you'll have to experiment with different item combinations to get through levels, and my god, the stones that you gradually unlock which add new features, are incredibly fun and rewarding. But once you've beaten ""The Temple"" (which appears to be the last real stage, from what I've found), you'll get the Mind Stone, and with that you'll have all of the stones, except for Moondial Stone, which you get from an endgame boss.The Mind Stone lets you harness the power of ""Stonescript"", which basically means you get to *program your character to do things that would normally be manual, or even impossible*. It's an incredibly refreshing idea and while currently limited, this IS an early access game, and the roadmap states lots of very powerful and fun features coming to it soon. It utilizes everything good about the ""automatic"" state of this Idle RPG and gives that power to you.Eventually, you'll upgrade one of the stones by painting it blue, which means you unlock a second tier to all levels. Normally you'd just start at 1 Star and work your way up to 5 Star, at which point you have ""finished"" the level and can replay it only to get more chests. But with the painted stone, you unlock a new tier of Blue Stars, that come after 5 White Stars, starting at 1 Blue Star up to 5 Blue Stars. My god, they are very difficult. You'll HAVE to grind at that point if you want to continue.But, the Mind Stone makes grinding less tedious than in any other old Idle game. You can program your character to do things frame-perfectly, to swap between items, dodge and weave through hordes of enemies, and optimize boss battles down to individual phases (with enough effort, of course!). Not to mention the Ouroboros Stone, which loops already completed levels so you can replay them infinitely without even touching a button... you have the power to program your own infinite level grinding machine!If you can get past it's flaws, this is an incredible Idle game that does things in a unique way and incorporates some fun RPG elements. It's hard to describe how I feel about this game, as I've not played through it 100% yet, but I certainly have enjoyed my time so far. 10/10 would ASCII again."
135,2588,"Great art style and unique game play. Combat involves focusing on equipment, and switching off before each encounter, rather than choosing moves directly. It has a good crafting system and the story delivery is decently interesting."

142,2588,"First impressions: Not what I was expecting.You equip your guy with items and send him to various locations where he fights monsters or discovers new items depending on his equipment. To me it plays much more like an idle clicker where the outcome changes for a given area depending on your equipment.  My first 10 minutes had me strongly considering requesting a refund, but I feel like i want to stick it out.What I can say for it is that the story is interesting so far and not just doled out for you on a platter and the art is a breath of fresh air. I do feel as though I have to keep playing it because I think it deserves a fair shot.Will update when I have some more hands on experience"

144,2588,"So right off the bat it's worth noting that in this game you don't control the movement of your avatar, it says it in the game summary but I didn't read that.  I had been following this games development through Reddit and bought it just from the videos I had seen of it.The gameplay is a little bit like an idle game but it really shines when it comes to the crafting system.  Throughout your adventures you will find swords, shields, runes, crossbows, and more; it's then up to the player to then find the best way to use these tools to craft better weapons and tools to get through the cruel world they find themselves in.  Graphics wise this is probably one of the most unique games I've seen in a long time given that it's art is made through ASCII characters.  It's got a certain charm to it and through it's art and animation alone is what sold me on this game.Sound design is really on point, one of the enemies you'll face in game is a bat, it might sound a little silly to say but, I was kinda blown away in it's sound design while the bat was flapping of its wings its sound matched with the animation.In short I'd say this game is very much worth picking up if you are into crafting tables and slight idle adventures."

I can't wait to see what was added since I played last, do yourself a favor and pick up Stone Story!"
161,2588,"Amazing ASCII game with a great sense of humor, people have been worried about the lack of user input but that paired with the soundtracks makes it a nice relaxing game. After playing a bit more of the game I'd like to add that it's not just mindless sending your character charging in mindlessly like some clicker game, it actually takes some thought to figure out what to use and where to go next.Really enjoyable :)"

163,2588,"The art style is a breath of fresh air. If you are looking for something to look at, something like a casual browser game with little clicking, but actually good production value, then this is it!But if you came here for exciting and engaging gameplay, you will be disapointed..It feels like a type of game that could be good if you want to chill a bit though.Works well for some. Not much for me unfortunately.Most of the game is essentially you choosing gear for a stickman, then sending it to a location where you sit and wait while you watch it gather resources and fight monsters. With no involvement from the player.You can also change equipment while watching your stickman run through whichever area it may be in.Choose a location, watch the stickman fight & pick up resources and loot. Rinse and repeat until you have enough resources to craft a canoe or whatever it is you need to explore further, or for your stickman to find the key to the next area.No penalty for dying.If I were to compare this to another style of game it would be those idler games where you send your adventurer out to gain gold. Then wait, and buy upgrades when you have enough gold.Cool enemies and boss fights become a boring drawn-out waiting-game. Because that's all you can do: sit and watch. And if you must find something for your fingers to do, you can pause the game and switch out your offhand for another kind of automated spellbook.In my own book; This is a point and click adventure. Where even the point and clicking is lacking.At least give me something to interact with while I watch the stickman do things. Like interact with the environment or something. Alter the landscape with my mouse, anything. But it's not my place to come up with ideas, it is to give my opinion.PS: I was about 2.5 hours in when I wrote the review. Was in offline-mode to get the most out of steam refunds."

165,2588,"Amazing ASCII game with a great sense of humor, people have been worried about the lack of user input but that paired with the soundtracks makes it a nice relaxing game. After playing a bit more of the game I'd like to add that it's not just mindless sending your character charging in mindlessly like some clicker game, it actually takes some thought to figure out what to use and where to go next.Really enjoyable :)"
166,2588,"I played during the closed beta and was quite smitten with this gem. Learning the secrets and watching the world unfold before your eyes is a real treat. As you can tell the art style is something to behold and it works as a perfect medium to suck you into this seemingly simple world. I can't wait to see what was added since I played last, do yourself a favor and pick up Stone Story!"
167,2588,I expected an action RPG but got a weird idle esc game instead. It's good
168,2588,"8/9/10 Things I want to improve:- Toolips in the crafting book, it's kind of confusing as to what is what, and it condenses a bit of combinations together.- Monster manual, its hard to understand what monster is weak to what type, the combat style part is obvious.If you like the art style and you like semi-grinding RPGs, that are hands off, this is the game for you.Cant wait to keep playing!"
169,2588,haven't stopped since release
170,2588,"The art style is a breath of fresh air. If you are looking for something to look at, something like a casual browser game with little clicking, but actually good production value, then this is it!But if you came here for exciting and engaging gameplay, you will be disapointed..It feels like a type of game that could be good if you want to chill a bit though.Works well for some.

171,2588,"The unique concept of a fully ASCII only rendered RPG was enough to make me want to buy it immedietely, let alone a unique story line. The lack of player involvement is a little underwhelming. LET ME CONTROL THE STICC."
