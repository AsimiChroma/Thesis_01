0,2704,A challenging puzzle game. Great for programmers who enjoy optimizing code.
1,2702,"This is a very specific type of game.  If you like taking a very large problem and breaking it down into bite-sized chunks, and then executing those chunks of problem-solving one-by-one, this is for you.  This is a game that feels like work, but very rewarding work.  If that doesn't sound fun, give it a pass.  This game is not for everyone.  It is for me."
2,2701,My favourite game ever made.
3,2700,very good game
4,2697,"Long ago, computers filled rooms and program instructions were punched onto cards (which tended to be dropped onto the floor, and disorganized, just before an assignment deadline).  We students puzzled over some simple, assigned task, punched instructions onto our cards, and then ""ran"" the cards to see if our instructions would perform the task, or would instead just crash and produce an error message.   Few saw their cards run right the first time; most, instead, saw the dreaded error message, and then pored over their cards, trying to find a formatting or logical error to explain their little program's crash.    This game reminds me of that ancient experience.   Here, the ""coding"" we do is visual, and our instructions are easily placed onto paths of our own creation (mostly).  We have the freedom of imagination to instruct largely as we choose.   But when finished instructing, we must ""run"" our creation and see if we have succeeded usefully, or must instead pore over our design to solve a disclosed error.I suspect that if you were or are good at writing computer programs, you will feel oddly at home in this game.  But if you weren't or aren't good at programming?  This still presents yet another chance to bite at that cognitive apple, and it might prove to be a satisfying bite.  I believe this game can lead someone, if he or she has some imagination and resolve, to experience the same positive glow that one gets from happily seeing one's newborn program run successfully and elegantly to perform a targeted task.  I owned this game for a few years before I got around to trying it, which I did, for the first time, this evening.  I'm sorry it took me so long to try: it is a truly wonderful game.  Other Zachtronics games have been very good, too: but this one, surprisingly, may turn out to be my favorite. It has a similar feel to Opus Magnum, but it might be even more admitting of individual and distinct approaches.  And any game that can even approach Opus Magnum in that regard is a stellar choice indeed.  The tutorials are good.   I believe some reviewer said they do not ""hold your hand.""   Well, they hold it a bit.   But they also expect you to start observing and pondering from the start.  This led, at least in my case, to a certain satisfaction and feeling of achievement even as I made my way through the series of tutorials (which I have about half-finished, so far, I believe).  Admittedly, however, at first I had to sit calmly and really pay attention to what was already on the screen, right in front of me, before I could realize what I should try next.     I'm glad that I didn't just give up in the first couple of minutes: this game would have been a terrible shame to miss.   As an interesting bonus, the game will remind of some light chemistry (although a knowledge of chemistry doesn't really seem necessary to play it).  It will remind of the periodic table and the individual elements within it.  Furthermore, the game will teach the chemical formulas of some real-life, important compounds -- and it will do that almost automatically, as progress in the game is made.  But despite the game's involvement with chemical formulas, the skills the game really calls upon feel to me much more like programming and planning skills.   Yet a foreknowledge of computer programming doesn't seem to be required in order to play and really enjoy the game.  Long story short?  I wrote this review immediately after my first session with it.   I've made good progress through the tutorials, but haven't finished them all yet.  Yet in this very first session of playing the game, it managed to engage me for hours.  If the tutorials are this much fun, I can hardly wait for the rest of the game to begin.  Zachtronics provides some games of real genius; this is yet another one of them.   Fortunately, one doesn't have to be a genius to enjoy this game; being fond of an interesting, well-designed series of challenges, and of learning by doing, seems enough."
5,2697,Good for your brain
6,2696,"Absolutely brilliant and fun game. If you;ve ever done any programming, try this...it's fun. and gets incredibly challenging."
7,2695,Classic Zachtronics
8,2693,A very challenging programming puzzle game absolutely worth playing.I found the defense assignments the most fun and creative. Each defense assignment has a unique twist to it.The only thing I didn't like is that the story isn't very connected to the puzzles except for defense assignments and the last two planets.The last puzzle isn't really as hard as they say it is. You just have to think about your pipeline and ratios before you begin programming reactors.
9,2692,epic
10,2692,"Very cool puzzle game, gets significantly harder after each level."
11,2692,"It's probably the most difficult game I've ever played. It's melting your brain...One important note - enable ordering for bonds in Game Options (numbers), otherwise you'll scratch you head many times and abandon the game. The ordering for bonding is quite important here if bonding happens in square."
12,2691,"if you have a single scrap of compassion left in your heart, then please send help immediately"
13,2691,You can cook 108kb/s of methe
14,2691,"It's brain-melting pseudo chemistry, highly recommend it if you want your brain to become soup (you also get a free TF2 item which is neat?)"
15,2690,Great mind challenging puzzles. Satisfying to play.
16,2690,AWESOOOOOOME Fun Little Space Puzzle GameGot it on discount sale and Got it for the FishCake and SpaceChem Pin For TF2 We need more Promo items like this for TF2
17,2689,"very cool puzzle game, hard too i like it !"
18,2689,only bought for fishcake
19,2689,"SpaceChem is one of those puzzle games like Baba is You that looks simple enough at a glance but is actually just waiting til the first act is done to make you feel incredibly stupid. You build circuit like rails to manipulate atoms, to build and or deconstruct molecules. But as you start getting into puzzles across multiple circuits, youll likely find yourself at the point of either needing to dedicate considerable time, or consulting a guide. Much like Baba is You, I think its worth it to consult a guide rather than miss out on what the later game puzzles have to offer. Originally, I bought SpaceChem cause of the TF2 crossover, which let you get an item in TF2, but I came to really respect SpaceChem for its own merits. Puzzle games like SpaceChem and Baba is You are few and far between, but worth delving into every time."
20,2689,"The first thing mentioned about Spacechem is that there are innumerable ways to complete a level. And that solutions are compared according to the number of instructions used (fewer is better) and time to complete (less is better). While these considerations are going to guide your game play, what they tend to forget is the feeling of ownership that goes way beyond simple metrics.You take pride in _your_ solution because it is uniquely _yours_, because it satisfies _your_ sense of rightness and efficiency and aesthetics. This game should be measured in terms of the emotions that it engenders, from a sense of beauty to the feeling of having created something that is the way it should be.How many straight up puzzle games can make such a claim? Clearly, SpaceChem is more than a puzzle game."
21,2689,"Very polished game with difficult puzzles, but with fair scaling. Overall would recommend"
22,2689,Makes Dark Souls look like a baby game.Makes me look like I belong in a mental asylum.My favorite puzzle game of all time.
23,2688,"SpaceChem is love. SpaceChem is life.This game is about using your programming skills to create space chemicals using waldos. This might sound simple on paper, but you're wrong. Very, very wrong. Because of two things:1. You only have limited space in a reactor, 80 tiles2. The programming language is in that space and is executed as your waldo moves along the symbols.This gives SpaceChem a very interesting challenge: how do you construct reagents with just this limited scope? And that challenge is just scratching the surface.You can only go over a specific tile twice: once horizontally, once vertically. You NEED to take advantage of this to do anything complex. Let's say you have N with a single bond, and you want it to have a triple bond. What you do is drop it onto some bonders through a grab/drop horizontally, perform two bond + instructions, and then grab it vertically from the same tile of the grab/drop. Now you're holding a triple bond N. Fantastic.Then the game drops a bombshell: fusion. Now you're performing addition with atoms. You can make almost anything as long as you have enough input reagents. Sikutar will break you.Then the game drops another bombshell: flip-flops. Now you can make loops, counters, etc. Remember going over a specific tile twice for specific things? It's now (mostly) a thing of the past! Just go over it again with flip flops. Amazing!Then the game drops another bombshell when you access ResearchNET: fission. Now you're doing ADVANCED math with atoms. You WILL need to bring up a notepad to figure out most nuclear puzzles. Absolutely bonkers.You'll tear your hair out trying out some of the later puzzles, and rage quit, but then you'll be dreaming about atoms and possible optimizations...Just know you most likely won't be seeing the ending. It is a very hard game after all. And that's okay."
24,2688,Still haven't beaten it. Maybe one day.
25,2687,"very space, not very chem"
26,2687,"This game is HARDIt's terrible for me, i can't stand it, my brain cannot comprehend even a quarter of it.It's like studying for a test that is tommorow but the material is 9 years aheadIt's hellIt's a well made game, great for people who like extremely hard puzzlesIf you want to buy this think about it like this:Do i want my brain fried?Am i smart?Do i want a fishcake and a pin in tf2?i bought it for the tf2 stuff"
27,2687,You have to be some sorta geeky ass nerd to play this ... only played it for a damn promo only reason why anyone even has this game.
28,2686,"It's good, a great puzzle game, and yes, fishcake, I think it's a given that's what a lot of people get spacechem for, but give it a go, it's a good game in itself."
29,2686,I'm not smart enough to be bored with this game completely. There's more than one way to win. Very low footprint on the hardware and great music
30,2686,"Haven't played much of this and already feel like a dumbass, would buy again without hesitation."
31,2685,The embodiment of pain and suffering. Not even Dark Souls can reach this threshold.
32,2685,One of a kind puzzle game. Way out of my league.Still got fish tho
33,2684,My brain hurts.
34,2683,"UI might be a bit outdated, but the puzzles are extremely satisfying to complete."
35,2683,"Sure, why not. It's a fun little puzzle game. Pretty challenging. I just turn off the music, because it's weird."
36,2682,"A classic.Also, there are boss fights. I didn't think a puzzle game like this could do that."
37,2682,"A mind-bending, difficult puzzle game I struggled through. If programming infused ""chemistry"" is your thing, you will feel right at home work playing this game. Additional Details  Operating System Ubuntu Linux 14.04 x64   CPU AMD FX-8350   GPU GTX 750   Notes DLC required for all achievements   Technical Notes No problems"
38,2682,"So dissapointed with this. The game looks awesome, especially since I am a chemist by training, but sadly, I am no computer expert and was not able to get this game to run properly. Moving the mouse too rapidly seemed to lock up the game, and my entire PC, despite meeting and exceeding all the needed specs. It is a rather old game I suppose. Wish this would have worked, if ever gets fixed, I will try it again."
39,2681,One of the few puzzle games that really make you think. Sometimes you even need to sleep over a problem and the next day find it increadibly easy.
40,2680,"Small, contained and very challenging puzzles to solve.  Optimising the solution to get the best / get an achievement is particularly interesting."
41,2679,"This is still the greatest Zachtronics game ever. Bar none. Which doesn't mean the others are bad, they're all amazing. But SpaceChem is the only one Zach made before he knew how to balance things for the mass market. If you're scared of getting stuck and want a ""play by your own pace"" game where you can set your own goals and finish the story no matter how good you are, play Opus Magnum. But if you want a game that will hound you, torture you, keep you up at night, make you fight tooth and nail to push your design to fit inside the reactor by sheer power of will, and leave you feeling like no one person should be allowed to possess this much spatial thinking power when you finally beat a hard level, this is the one and only.It feels amazing when you're sitting in some of the later defense levels, hectically flipping switches in a very precise sequence like some hamster in a wheel that's part of a huge Rube Goldberg machine to substitute for the remaining parts of your design that you should have automated but didn't have room for anymore, and then you ever so barely manage to trigger the end of level *just* before the whole construction would blow up from all the excess waste products that you didn't find a proper way to dispose of anymore and just kind of stuffed away in some corner hoping the game wouldn't notice in time. The first 2/3rds of the game are still fine, with a reasonable difficulty curve where you'll mostly have enough breathing room to try to optimize the reactor count if you feel like getting fancy. Then on Atropos Station  gets real pretty fast."
42,2678,"I guess it's true what they say that videogames are best used to gain experience that player miss out in their everyday life.Because as a programmer with hobby projects, playing through this puzzle of a visual programming has been a chore so far, like a work simulator.When I play puzzle games, I either want to be learning something new while having ""aha!"" moments, or experience new things too. SpaceChem doesn't deliver. I open a new level, keep looking at it, imagining that I can do it ineffeciently but still do it and keep staring at it in search of elegant ""aha!"" solution. Then I realize that no, it has to be done dirty, you just optimize said dirtyness. And thus you set it up, maybe see where you can cut few corners, run into visual space limits, groan, repeat. Rinse and repeat. I could be doing real programming, maybe with more actual ""oh, this would be elegant"" moments than this game.As of right now, I just can't push myself through another level, because yea. That's not entertainment for me. Dirty optimization may work for some like Factorio with bigger goal, but as separate puzzle levels... nah. There is a bit of management play by connecting reactors while you set up the annoying visual programming with limits inside each reactor, but gosh, do I not wanna.It doesn't help that aesthetical enjoyment are all-time low in this game. Fine enough presentation, but it lacks any drama. Story is given in bits here and there as plain text, music is just one of random loops. It's a fine story but I felt that I was not getting a reward appropriate to time and effort spent.So eh... Will still push through Zachtronic games, as fellow programmer did tell me that Opus Magnum is where they learned to make actual puzzles instead of chores."
43,2678,Simply the best. Better than all the rest.
44,2677,Great game! If you like Factorio you'll probably like SpaceChem also. (and visa-versa)
45,2676,"Such challenge, such fun.I think my brain started melting though towards the last few worlds.Especially great if you have a programming mindset."
46,2675,"YES YES A THOUSAND TIMES YES! I played this through back when it was first released, and was instantly hooked.I still have that original hiding away in a HDD somewhere - I've thought about it often and figured one day I'd fire it up again for old time's sake, but never did. You know how life gets in the way of gaming sometimes.Then I realized, HEY! IT'S ON STEAM! So, here we are a decade later, and although it feels like only yesterday that I worked out those puzzles, it is all fresh and new again... plus there are ""new"" levels since I last played it, AND... (drumroll) TF2 GOODIES! So as soon as I clear the Moustachium levels, I'll finally have a legit Fishcake and SpaceChem Pin. (*)If you enjoy puzzles that have a huge number of solutions, and have a bit of a ""geek streak"", you'll definitely love this gem. There's always more than one way to solve a given task, and the real challenge is trying to shave down your design to use the fewest symbols and cycles, and to trying to beat the quotas on production challenges. SpaceChem will really tickle the perfectionist in you, and maybe even make you rage a little sometimes. :^)Now if you'll excuse me, I have a little hydrogen cyanide to make..."
47,2674,"If you like these sort of programming puzzles you will find this game worth playing. Its not great though, its only good. Its the kind of game where you enjoy it but also end up wishing it had done some things differently or better."
48,2674,Umm playing on Linux... Lvl 2 doesn't seem to function correctly.. game is too busy with Tutorial to make a sensible solution.. and Google/Reddit search of solutions seem horribly outdated..Generally Zachtronics games don't suffer from updates killing functionality.. but this one seems currently broken.. or I'm a verified idiot.. come crucify me internetss.
49,2673,Fun puzzle game.
50,2673,my brain hurts
51,2671,im too dumb to play this i just bought it for the fishcake
52,2671,I wanted to measure my abilities and all I got was PAIN and CHEMISTRY.  I now know my limits.
53,2670,Extremely mentally challenging. This would have made me enjoy chemistry in highschool.
54,2670,My brain burns in the most pleasant way possible.
55,2669,An algorithm-based puzzle game. Just make all the chemicals you want. It also has custom level design
56,2669,"This is one of the most frustration, but most rewarding games ive ever played"
57,2668,took me 5 years to finally understand how this game worksim stupid
58,2668,Fun Game. Highly Recommend.
59,2667,I LOVE this game. It's great.
60,2667,its nice
61,2667,"Really cool and fun puzzle game. This game will push you to really think, but beating each level is satisfying. May have also turned my brain into soup. 8/10"
62,2667,"I bought this game for two dollars and tried to play it for five minutes.   I already feel as if I want my two dollars back.  Perhaps this will change, in time."
63,2666,"Awesome, still ranks a top game 10 years later."
64,2665,Great kinda-visual-programming puzzle game
65,2665,"I like this game, it's complicated and fascinating.  when its working the motion is hypnotic.  you have to create working automated assembly lines for molecules, atom by atom, from available resources.  various commands to execute on independent customisable tracts. some levels are challenging to say the least.  I'm not too far in and its taking a lot of time to coordinate a solution for the target from available materials.  the challenges make it fun for me."
66,2664,"Looking at the whole Zachtronics library, it's hard to ignore this juggernaut; despite being almost ten years old by the time of writing this review, it might still be the best game from this developer."
67,2663,Very challenging. Can get a little bit frestruting but the TF2 easter egg makes up for it.
68,2662,This game makes me feel so  stupid but I love it.

70,2661,"Really interesting problem solving game. Instead of finding the solution to the puzzle, you can come up with your own solution and compare it with other players' to see the efficiency of your own."
71,2661,"Oh man, SpaceChem and I go way back... I first picked up this game in 2015. I enjoyed the first few puzzles, until I ran headfirst into a difficulty spike on the third world. Quickly tiring of my inability to make progress, I moved on to other things, but it always kept nagging me in the back of my mind. I knew it was within my abilities, and I even tried to pick it up a couple times in the months afterward, but I was never really able to sink my teeth into it.Five years and an engineering degree later, I decided to revisit my old nemesis. I restarted the game and quickly progressed to the same wall I had hit in the past... and to my surprise, managed to blast through it. And the level after that. And all the way through to the end of the game. And the weirdest thing is I don't really think I'm any better at it now than I was five years ago. I think the difference is perspective.SpaceChem is absolutely a hard game. But I don't think it's hard because you need to be a genius to solve the puzzles. Instead it's hard because it demands lots of time and effort and is uncompromising in its expectations. Unlike other puzzle games, where there's often a eureka moment where you make a vital connection and the rest of the solution falls into place, every inch of progress in stitching your molecules together is hard won. You have to experiment, try different approaches, fail, tweak your designs, and sometimes tear it all down and start over with something completely new to get everything to work.It wasn't until I had worked on real world engineering problems that I truly appreciated what SpaceChem was asking of me. Once I did though, I came to love its challenges. The feeling of looking at a puzzle for the first time and wondering how the hell you're gonna even begin to solve it, then putting the last piece of your crazy contraption into place a few hours later and have the whole thing come together and just *work*... It's incredible. That feeling is what you buy the game for."
72,2661,SPAAAAAAAAAAAACE!
73,2660,Yea ok I'm not smart enough.
74,2660,Software engineering disguised as chemical engineering
75,2660,Would you recommend this game to other players? Yes -- No -- Maybe Later -- Stop Asking Me
76,2660,Time flies really fast while playing it. You'll find yourself thinking about the game even after turning off the computer
77,2660,Challenging and interesting
78,2660,You have no idea what you're getting yourself into.
79,2659,"""It's sort of like Skyrim, but with more post-modern pointilism."""
80,2659,Removing pipes sounds like eating apples in minecraft 10/10
81,2659,A fun engineering game where I feel like the game doesn't get in the way of itself. Yeah there are some improvements possible but it's not like lesser engineering games I've played where I feel like the game is making the problem harder to solve. This is a really really fun and satisfying game to play if you're interested in systems and processes. I'm invested in the story and the music's good too. I'm glad that the story is available without solving all the puzzles because I'm afraid I may not make it!
82,2658,i think i may be braindeadi like this game i just happen to be too stupid to play it
83,2658,"Intriguing puzzles. Quite hard, but it is now the itch I have to scratch."
84,2657,"I don't get it and the ""tutorial"" does a piss-poor job of explaining it."
85,2657,"WHAT IS IT?It's a puzzle and logic game.  Thematic element is chemistry and space.PROS:1. Wildly addictive brainteaser/puzzle game2. Has some merit to teaching basic logical coding and chemistry in a unique way3. Simple controls4. Entertainment value to price is enormousCONS:1. A small learning curve, maybe a bit more for folks that aren't used to logic games (specifically coding-type games).CONCLUSION:It's hard to put the game down when you are trying to beat the records (or at least get close to it).  The game requires a lot of forethought in how you can achieve the solution, and there are many ways to solve each ""puzzle"".  When you see the records, you likely will try to beat it as it isn't satisfying to just solve it.  So, at least for me, I play the same puzzle many times trying to figure out the best possible solution to beat or at least match the top records.  Other than that, the story element is minimal, it is presented as a few descriptive texts between most levels but doesn't really serve much of any other purpose.  You'll quickly forget the game has a story at all.  But I guess that's not really the point of this game.GRADE:8/10"
86,2656,A great programming puzzle game from Zachtronics based around manipulating chemicals in a scifi story that is used to introduce new tools/options for the various problems and emergencies that must be solved.The tools are added or locked often enough to keep the game going without over complicating the main ideas needed for any given puzzle and the open design area allows for different solutions.
87,2656,"Just like other Zachtronics games, this game makes you want to try, quit, try, quit, and so on."
88,2656,Simple but fun puzzles. Lots of ways to solve many of them. Well worth the price.
89,2655,Zachtronics never fails to deliver a very rewarding challenge!
90,2655,nice
91,2655,game big brainme small brain
92,2655,You need an IQ of 140 to get far.Well that's what it feels like anyway :D I found it very difficult.
93,2655,It good
94,2655,I had multiple mental breakdowns.
95,2655,Fun but way too big brain for me.Great game though.
96,2654,It's really good.
97,2654,.
98,2653,yes
99,2653,GG
100,2653,Arguably one of the harder Zachtronics puzzles.
101,2653,I bought it for the fishcake.
102,2653,"I got all the achievements, put a screenshot of it on my resume, and it got me a job as a programmer."
103,2652,"A challenging, yet fun, puzzle game. Figuring out the solution to a problem makes you feel like a genius. The music in this game is great too."
104,2652,Best game ever i just got the game and loved it.  its the a really good puzzle game.
105,2651,"Great puzzle game. Easy to understand, challenging puzzles.  Getting all achievements makes it even more challenging. The game uses chemical elements, but it could also have been blocks and triangles. Don't let this scare you. It takes some time (up to many hours) to solve a single level and there are a lot of levels. The interface is great. I highly recomend this game to people who like puzzle games."
106,2650,Still working my way through it but this is an amazing puzzle game!  The puzzles are really tricky and require a lot of creative problem solving.  They get so hard that I had to write out a detailed plan for how to solve one of the puzzles.  It was extremely satisfying to see that one work out!  Really recommend this game if you are looking for a really good challenge!!
107,2650,"An excellent logic puzzler. I have found it relaxing-ly taxing on my head during those intermissions when I can disconnect.Oh, who am I kidding?!? I'm that guy who wakes up in the middle of the night, sits up, and thinks, ""I have a (better) solution for that last one"". Mutha...."
108,2649,-
109,2649,Is this game good?  Yes.  Would I recommend it to you?   No.Why not?   Because you aren't smart enough for it.
110,2649,"Another plot by the nefarious Zachtronics charlatans to trick young, impressionable men into working full-time jobs instead of playing video games. Very nice, 10/10."
111,2648,"Good challenging puzzle. Probably on the harder side of the Zactronics games spectrum. Music is okay and story is there, I guess."
112,2647,Infuriatingly satisfying
113,2646,This is my fourth Zachtronics game. And Zachtronics still didn't disappoint.
114,2646,i've only played it for a small while but i still recommend this game to people who like problem solving
115,2644,"Does not contain so much chemistry per se, but is a great puzzle game. Contains many puzzles in a campaign-style which offers a lot of play-time. Challenging and very fun."
116,2643,fun puzzle solving
117,2642,"sphincter ani becomes tighter and tighter until level is solved in order for the sphincter to fully relax again. Only to start all over again at the next level. Can't stop, caught in a loop. Perfect game."
118,2642,It's like programing but fun
119,2642,This game is very challenging.I would say this should be somewhere in the top 10 of best puzzle games ever:)
120,2641,First Zachtronics game I played. It's an addicting puzzle game.
121,2641,"The best puzzle game I've ever played; it's kind of a programming puzzle game, but it's so good that I (someone who has never programmed ever) didn't notice and understood the systems fairly well, and still after all these hours have more to master."
122,2641,"A puzzle game that will challenge your logic like no other, great concept, great execution. A real hidden gem!"
123,2641,Definitely one of the more difficult zachtronics games if you're coming from a programming background. The hard limit of only two programmable bots and your instructions taking up actual space on a small board makes the puzzles here uniquely challenging.
124,2640,My brain hurts
125,2640,"This is a classic game and well worth a purchase if you truly - truly - like puzzles. I love that I'm 50+ hours in and still have a good portion of the levels left to play. At this point, it's usually taking me 4+ hours playtime to solve the larger challenges. Sometimes a lot more, if I go too far down the wrong track.Yes, there's a programming aspect to this, but more in the sense of automation: you're effectively creating little robots to do what can only loosely be described as chemistry (more like math). There's a story to tie it all together, and it's good, but hardly central to the game.The game shows its vintage in the UI sometimes, but it's still a lot of fun. Don't blame me if your head explodes tho. It's a risk of the job."
126,2639,Great puzzle - programming game...
127,2639,Epic game
128,2639,"I really wanna enjoy it, but for some reason I just can't get into it.  That being said, it's a neat concept with complexity hidden behind simplicity."
129,2638,Fun puzzle game with plenty of levels
130,2637,the most awesome game ever!!!
131,2637,"An excellent puzzle game, with a light sprinkling of nifty story."
132,2637,"The tutorials are pretty horrible at explaining a few optimization tricks that are required to get the best possible solution. You can make your circuits as complicated as you want (that's what I did for the first 3 hours of the game). But this game is awesome. It really really is. I'm still not too far into the game, but after learning a few tips to reduce a few unnecessary operations, I have found a totally new appreciation for this game. It is superb!"
133,2636,Pull out your hair simulator. You can have everything running smoothly only for it to suddenly fail for no discernible reason. Not helping is how small and similar looking everything is which makes it even more difficult to figure out what went wrong. Less fun than trying to untangle Christmas lights.
134,2635,There is nothing quite like the feeling you get when you solve the puzzles in this game. It is extremely rewarding to see each factory flawlessly execute its instructions to make its chemical compound. Afterwards you can choose to relentlessly optimize your solution and see how it stacks up against other players.
135,2635,"Being able to watch your program run is great. Unlike other puzzle games where you're navigating limited physical space, having a myriad number of ways to solve each challenge is great. This game is so great. Like, wow."
136,2634,this game makes me feel mentally challenged
137,2634,Fun puzzle game that is basically programming. Challenging.
138,2634,"Wonderfully engaging and original puzzles that basically use coding logic but none of the fiddly language. Even when you've achieved a level you can always go back and try to improve an aspect of how you solved it the first time. The only down-side are the ""Boss-battle"" type missions, those are my least favourites."
139,2634,"It's a Zacktronics game. If you like this kind of game you'll love it. If you don't skip. As Zack has said he ""doesn't make fun games"". He makes puzzles you will obsess over."
140,2634,Programmers will love this game - Absolutely Amazing
141,2634,I'm not into puzzle games that much but there's something oddly satisfying about figuring out the solution to each puzzle in this game. 8/10
142,2632,"A bit to tedious for me to enjoy playing. Not to say the puzzles are ""too difficult"", but they are not something I would enjoy doing in my spare time."
143,2631,"Pure LogicPura LgicaPure LogiqueBuy this game if you love the HARD Games of Logic...this game have Chemical Notions (very basic) and Visual Programing + CRAZY LOGIC,yo build Molecules, you bond + & - and make amazing stuffs."
144,2631,Fun brain-stretcher
145,2631,"Very good puzzle game, but it is not easy. Need to have good logical thinking capabilities to have fun with it.#LoveIndies"
146,2630,Skull breaking puzzle game
147,2630,"In today's seemingly distant two thousand and eleventh year, the little-known studio Zachtronics Industries released the game SpaceChem, which can literally be translated as Space Chemistry. What happens infrequently, the name completely conveys the essence: we have to do chemistry in space (not in the open, of course, but not on Earth) as a young engineer, namely, to program processes in molecular reactors, and sometimes even build small production complexes .I think, already at this moment it becomes clear that SpaceChem is not an action, not a quest or even a graphic novel, SpaceChem is a very harsh and hardcore puzzle, but first things first. Let's start with the plot.He is, and meets us with the phrase ""You know, people die in space"", which sets the general tone for the whole story. The plot here is essentially a medium-sized short story that connects levels and reveals a classic parable about the menacing majesty of the unknown and the fragility of the person who encounters this unknown. Pretty pleasant reading, framed by small sketches. But the salt of the game is far from history. It's time to talk about the gameplay itself.Most of the time, the player watches a ten-by-eight board. On this board, he programs two lines - red and blue. When the reactor starts, manipulators start running along the lines, which, when passing through the cells marked by the player, perform various actions - they capture and throw, connect, rotate molecules of various substances (new teams appear later). The goal is to obtain molecules of other substances from the molecules of some substances that appear in the left half of the reactor through transfers and transformations, and then send them to the right half. And you need to program the reaction scheme so that it runs for several tens of cycles. It seems to me that it is rather difficult to describe game mechanics clearly, or I just cant do this, so Ill give a small analogy.The gameplay of SpaceChem is like solving a problem in a technical subject: computer science, physics, geometry, and the like. There is a clearly stated condition. There is a certain device that allows you to perform various operations. And most importantly, there is room for creativity. The gameplay of most games of this genre is to find the answer conceived by the authors. Here, there is no clear-cut framework for how to solve the proposed problem. Most of the SpaceChem levels can be completed in dozens, if not hundreds of different ways, and the emotions from the next successfully completed reaction are the same as from finding a solution to the very system of diffours that has been haunting for a couple of days.The emphasized cold and minimalistic design just creates the feeling that I'm sorry, you didnt come here to be entertained, but to engage in a business that requires a serious approach and concentration. In the stages with the construction of chemical plants, the game becomes even more complicated, forcing you to think in a slightly different plane and decide for yourself which molecules and in what order to load into the reactors, laying piping systems and choosing where to place the reactors.It is impossible not to mention the complexity. With a sufficiently high entry threshold, SpaceChem does not slow down throughout its entire length and constantly throws up increasingly complex and more non-trivial tasks, and at the end brazenly selects nights spent trying to at least find the right course of the reaction. A sort of Dark Souls puzzle world.In conclusion, I note that everyone who wants to stretch their brains loves games of this genre, interesting tasks and severe challenges, SpaceChem is simply recommended, unless of course you have heard of it before. The rest, I believe, does not make much sense to get acquainted with this game, and the plot can be read on the Internet."
148,2629,"As a senior chemical engineer, everytime this game puts me to my knees, I wanna die.100% recommended."
149,2629,Super addictive
150,2628,atom machine go brrrrrr
151,2628,"I remember playing this is 2015/2016 on my iPad when I was in Year 7, and now that I'm replaying, I can't comprehend how young me solved these challenges. This is an amazing game, even with the headaches included."
152,2628,Some of the later levels are really difficult but overall a great game
153,2626,Is fun. Is challenging.
154,2626,I want to cry
155,2626,"How this game is overwhelmingly positively rated while only 35% of the players get to about the 10th level of what is probably a 100 level plus game is beyond me.  The clear rate is under 5% and I'll bet if I could see the stats on this game, 50% of players that start it up don't spend more than 30 minutes playing it.  At first I wanted to say it's because this game is hard, or at least climbs too steeply in difficulty.  But really it's just overwhelmingly obtuse in how it presents its data to the player, the bonding system only just barely makes sense and the input/output system take about an hour to understand by themselves.  Either way, what this means is most of those players are too embarressed to come back here and tell you they aren't smart enough to get more than a couple of hours through this game.  I'm getting old though, I don't give a care, this game is too hard by half, and flip a coin that's your odds of playing this for more than 30 minutes.  I can't recommend a game like that."
156,2626,It good.
157,2625,This game is really an exercise in real time programming in that you have to create circuits to perform tasks. The complexity builds in a nice way and as you learn you can go back and revisit previous attempts to improve them. A very absorbing game.
158,2625,"Do you like puzzle games?Do you like really hard puzzle games?Do you like really hard puzzle games with infinite solutions?Do you like spending hours finding a solution?Do you like spending hours finding a solution, which has one tiny flaw?One flaw which forces you to scrap hours of work?One flaw which forces you to start all over again?The dark souls of puzzle games. It's uncompromisingly difficult, infinitely deep, and so incredibly rewarding."
159,2624,"Highly addictive and fun to play.  In game tutorials are a bit confusing, so I found some beginner videos which helped me quite a bit.  Now I'm sailing along."

201,2612,A 2D Infinifactory which focuses on Chemical production.The game is addictive if you are a programmer / OCD patient who always want to build the best solution.
202,2611,its fun
203,2609,"The epitome of rebarbative.The ratio of positive reviews is utterly baffling.Firstly, this is no puzzle game. This is state machine programming. It's work. If this is a game, then tax return filing is a game. If it's your thing, go for it, but...How am I to expect clever ""programming puzzles"" when the GUI is one of the stupidest I've ever seen? Not that it sacrifices ergonomics for the sake of beauty... Just look at that hideous clusterfukc...- Nothing is readable. Every text is about 2 pixels high.- Nothing indicates what is clickable or not- The first tutorial button leaves the game to jump to your browser's youtube!- Just as an example, play/pause use 2 distinct buttons, instead of a dual one.- Pseudo-windows overlap the game area, hiding parts of it. They can't be moved or closed or interacted with whatsoever.- After a while, I went for the linux version, to take advantage of XFCE's zoom feature. Technical issues and lack of options froced me to manually locate and manipulate the config file.I made the effort to play a few levels, just enough to realise that even the chemistry is BS.The linux availability is the only redeeming quality I could find. It's boring, it's ugly, and the interface is laughable."
204,2609,"Very challenging, yet amazingly simple in design"
205,2608,"Chemistry was...always this complex, wasn't it?PROS: This is a very unique puzzle game.  By bonding chemical elements onto tracks and carefully monitoring them, puzzles are solved.  Its very simple in concept, but becomes very challenging very quickly.  Alongside just solving regular puzzles, boss battles provide more difficult puzzles under a time limit.  The music is charming and a joy to listen to, with some great ambiance and background noise to to get the mind working.CONS: Being a unique puzzle game comes at a positive, but it also creates a very large detriment.  The game's difficulty is in a league of it's own.  Where some puzzles took five minutes to solve, some took well over an hour.  On top of that, some of the game's features are not explained very well, though online guides do help break down the mechanics.ACHIEVEMENTS: Good lord, this list took some time to complete.  If you're good at these types of puzzles, it shouldn't be that bad, mostly challenges for completion under a certain value.  If you're not, it will be a drag of a time.FINAL: This game is a puzzle experience that's rare, but being rare doesn't automatically mean good.  Its worth a look for the challenge and those moments when you complete a sequence through trial and error."
206,2607,*sees game about manufacturing complex chemicals*yeah this is the game for me
207,2607,Excellent puzzle and optimization game
208,2607,"I don't have a programming/engineering brain, so before long it become too difficult. But much enjoyed.Strictly it's problem solving not puzzles: the challenge increasingly became a matter of elaboration, complexity. That's time consuming and not how I want to spend my gaming time."
209,2607,"I think I'm too stupid for this game, but I keep trying. It's a great puzzle game and has very interesting and fresh mechanics that keep me coming back."

211,2605,good
212,2605,Playing 170 hours of Skyrim didn't prepare me for this at all.
213,2605,Really good. Tricky.
214,2604,Fenomenal game. Recommend it to everyone who likes a good puzzle-solving game.
215,2604,"First one of the series that officially shattered the line between work and games. Even if graphics are a little dated, as for all of them, highly recommended for anyone looking for a mental challenge, and hours upon hours spent on making stuff work."
216,2604,"It is creativity and study, a very difficult and patient thing. This game is dedicated to people who love engineering, electronics or the desire to squeeze their heads, for example.I love it, the problems are becoming more difficult and in addition the BSO encourages you to think and propose solutions.I love to see when things work but it is a very difficult challenge as a player who plays everything, I really can not assess his difficulty but I think it is total."
217,2604,"The best part about this game is that there's no one way to solve a problem. The answer to the problem is entirely up to you. The feeling of satisfaction you get from solving a problem that's been stumping you for a while is really gratifying. There's something innately satisfying about using your problem solving skills to finally get something done. Watching everything come together in the production view is a really good feeling.I get that this game is not for everyone, but damn is it for me."
218,2603,"Probably the most difficult puzzle game I've played. Somewhat addicting, trying to make everything work."
219,2603,"SpaceChem is one of the few games that manages to catch my attention again and again. This brilliant logic puzzling game always motivates me to search for the most efficient solution. But beware: While this game is perfect for a casual gaming-quicky, the thoughts of the latest puzzle you were working on before quitting will keep haunting you ;)"
220,2603,"I don't think I've ever thought so hard. This is a good combination of spatial puzzle with programming and multi-threading. The story in intriguing as well. The graphics are very basic, but that doesn't take away from the complexity of the puzzles."
221,2603,"Even if it's not %100 accurate, I think most people will remember SpaceChem as ""the one that started it all"" - This game set the standard for Zachtronics games, from basic design language and scoring system, to difficulty and tone. The design of SpaceChem is still influencing Zachtronics games today, and the world is better for it!"
222,2602,"Good puzzles, pretty difficult until you get the hang of it. I really enjoy watching the automations of the reactors once I've solved the level. The music is really good for such a simple game. I really enjoy a lot of the games from Zachtronics, they really seem to use video games as a medium to teach people things."
223,2601,Puzzles
224,2601,Not enough IQ
225,2600,levels get fiendishly difficult near the end.  it is much more difficult than Opus Magnum.
226,2600,"I played a little, I think it's ok"
227,2600,"This is the original Zachtronics physical programming game that more or less started the genre. The later games in the series like Infinifactory (same author) and Factorio (different author) have added a lot, but the original still stands up pretty well to its modern counterparts. The placement interface is a bit awkward, but not insurmountably so."
228,2600,"Really fun puzzle game. Steep learning curve (and difficulty in general), but well worth the effort. Cute story too."
229,2599,"SpaceChem is the Ur-Zachlike. If you like fiendish open ended puzzles, awesome soundtracks, depth of complexity and the ability to see how your solution stacks up vs everybody elses: you'll enjoy this. That I'm still playing it over 5 years after buying it speaks volumes"
230,2597,I want to be smart enough to finish SpaceChem one day.  It makes me want to be a better gamer.  :)
231,2597,fantastic
232,2592,I love this game/concept! A perfect blend of fun puzzle solving and chemistry!
233,2587,"Really cool concept here. If you like logic puzzles and chemistry, you will not be disappointed. The beginning scenarios step you through the basics and eventually leave it up to you on how to solve the reactions in the most efficient way. It has leader board rankings so you can gauge how well you did and go back and try to improve your reactor designs. It's definitely addicting!"
234,2586,"A great puzzle-programming game, if not the best.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1819968964I am considering myself as pretty clever person. When I was at school I had all chances to get in programming University, I passed all exams, but changed my future profession to another subject at last time. I liked solving different tasks with BASIC. It was very satisfying.This game is a simple simulator of programming. You don't have a lot of freedom, but you can plan. You start with several steps. Your routes are getting longer and more complicated each new mission. You get a puzzle (reactor routes) inside a puzzle. The game becomes extremely difficult, but you will get amazing feelings after solving each new puzzle.In overall, the game shows you basic of programming. It is a great way to understand can you be good/bad at programming. Also, it is a extremely hard puzzle game which requires a lot of planning and thinking.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1819968862Pros- A great idea. It is like a programming but for commoners. Plan you actions and achieve goals- Nice progression. You start with basics. Each new level gets slightly harder. Puzzles get hard after second world.- In the end of second world you get a puzzle inside a puzzle (you can route inside a reactor.... and can route elements between reactors)- There is a story- Music is greatCons- Didn't find anyhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1819968929ResumeAn excellent games. It is great for people who are considering learn programming. Also, it is just a great puzzle game. Learning curve is very intense. You start with basics, but 11th missions is brain killer, but there are morel levels. Passing a level is very satisfying. I can recommend this game for people who likes thinking for a full price."
235,2586,"It seems like a great game, but I'm unable to play it due to it's graphical / lack of display settings, and just scrolling through the forums and disscusions it seems like I'm not the only one with the problem. I've tried multiple different ways of trying to fix it and none have seemed to work"
236,2586,a  great game.Mandrian please...........
237,2586,"When I first read about the puzzle games by Zachtronics, the promises were to good for mathematics and IT affectionate people like I consider myself so that I soon had to buy one, I didn't wait for a sale and took SpaceChem for the simple reason of being one of the older and therefore cheaper games, Never would I have expected to play it THAT much.After 90 hours of gameplay, which I had in less than 3 weeks, I did all the challenges, optimized some solutions in a battle with a friend and also did some of the community levels from ""ResearchNet"", but I was stuck at the level ""Omega-Pseudoethyne"" on the next to last planet. There was just so much logic to cram into two reactors, that I tried and tried but couldn't come up with the right approach. I watched some solutions on Youtube, but was fortunately to proud to just copy one. After putting the game aside for a few months, I tried it again and did it. The feeling of success was immense, even though the statistics that can be seen in a histogram after each level were bad.Wikipedia gives the perfect description of the game as ""visual programming language"". The most difficult restrictions, when designing the solutions are that only one command for each color can be on a field and that each field can be only run through from two sides (before flip flops are introduced). So later solutions sometimes blow up in size, because you run into unexpected problems and somehow still want it to run. But after all everything can be optimized and made better through hard thinking and that is, what makes this and other Zachtronics games so great.My main criticism is the lack of a storing option for several solutions at once. I would for example like to use aforementioned solution as a starting point for optimization, but at the same time try completely new approaches. It's not possible without using another profile where I would have to do the complete game again upon this point. Since newer Zactronics games (which I bought later on sale) have this option, I would now recommend OpusMagnum and Exapunks more than this."
238,2585,"This game is remarkably similar to real programming.There are other games out there that try to make you feel like a programmer, or rather games that make you feel like you think a programmer would feel.Few games are actually able to capture the problem solving difficulty or scope quite effectively.I don't know if the developers created this game with that intent however.That's not really important to many people anyway.The puzzles are challenging but the difficulty increases at a fair pace. Its not a game you can do in one sitting, as you might get worn out after one or two towards the end. Take each puzzle one or two at a time, don't try to rush."
239,2585,A great game
240,2584,"A real programming language has proper operator precedence. Spacechem tries, it does it well, but it kinda misses the target as the graphical programming is unnecessarily difficult, since there is no operator precedence (it's always red before blue, no matter what operation is performed). Imagine having two variables in an addition, and somehow the addition is performed before the second variable is assigned.Spacechem is a great game if you're not serious about it, but if you like mathematics and optimization, you will get frustrated really fast. In other words, it's a fine game, but not a good substitute for work."
241,2583,"Does not launch on Linux. On Windows, game starts in 640x480 resolution and 3/4 of the screen is cut off - unplayable."

247,2582,"It's the good , bruh110/10"
248,2582,So glad that Zachtronics still cared about this game and has kept it running on new mac os releases.
249,2582,Great puzzle game I've heard a lot about.  Finally getting around to playing it and it is really fun.  It's quite challenging and I'm only about half way through.
250,2582,It's alright if you're into alternative puzzles!
251,2582,"Only right now I realized I hadn't review this masterpiece yet. And though I tend to write long reviews about my games, I guess I'll be short and rephrase here a quote from the other review.I'll put the list of achievements in this game in my resume. As a programmer, I absolutely must do it. And basically, this is all you should know about this game. If you want to feel your brain overheating like a meltdowned nuclear reactor while having an unstoppable urge to find a better optimisation to your algorithm and have a beautiful afterglow afterwards, go and play this right now.P.S. You can play other Zachtronics games too, but I've played Infinifactory and TIS-100 already and they are not even close to be this brilliant. Though, TIS-100 can be a pretty unique challenge for you after this, while Infinifactory still looking like a poor Minecraft clone for me...-----If you are interested in other games I'm playing, check my Curator page. Maybe there will be something good for you."
252,2582,Can't believe that I owned and played this for this long but haven't wrote the review yet. For people who had played any other games by Zachtronics and love it: Just try it. You will not regret. Overall a great puzzle game and classic Zach-like.
253,2582,"Excellent puzzle design, worth every penny!"
254,2582,I just started this game and I can already see that I'll be spending quite a bit of time enjoying the game-play. A great science-based puzzle game.
255,2582,These ain't your father's chemical processing plants
256,2582,Truly excellent puzzle game. Not too tricky to get a working solution but lots of depth and challenge in optimising.
257,2582,Programing game for people who know nothing about programing. 3 hours in and my brain hurts. I can't stop playing!
258,2582,If only real chemistry worked this way....
259,2582,"Visual programming chemistry, great fun"
260,2582,"This game is not for everyone. In fact, it's probably not for most people. It's an assembly-line style puzzler, without set solutions. What that means is that there's not one ""right"" answer to a puzzle, instead, it's an open-ended question.The graphics, mechanics, and sound are all really good, and if you like optimizing assembly lines, this is the game for you.Most puzzles hinge on you being given not nearly enough space to do something comfortably, and being forced to squeeze your assembly lines into places they really don't fit.The storyline is decent, not great, but where this game shines is the high you get from solving something that looked impossible. As for content, the game is pretty long itself, and the user-made levels are practically endless. (Though, as fair warning, a lot of the user levels had a difficulty curve that made the main game look like a tutorial. It was like hitting a brick wall of ""oh god how is that remotely possible"") All in all, this game is excellent, just really niche. If you're still unsure, look up ""Codex of Alchemical Engineering"" online, it's a free game made by the same people, with an almost identical feel. If you like that, buy this. If you don't, don't buy this. You could almost think of Codex as a demo for this game, and that would give you a much better idea of whether you'll like this than all the reviews you could read."
261,2582,Good game.
262,2582,One of the best puzzle games I've played.
263,2582,You'd have to be a certified genius to run out of things to do in this game.
264,2582,"Clever, intuitive, and fun"
265,2582,Great game! Requires a little bit of thinking though.
266,2582,A tough chemistry-inspired puzzle game. Half the fun is in optimising solutions to go as fast as possible or use as few instructions as possible.
267,2582,"you will probably enjoy SpaceChem if you like solving puzzles (like jigsaw and sudoku puzzles). It also gives that feeling of, ""This is impossible, how am I gonna get this done."" when you start, to ""Oh my goodness, I am a genius!"" when you solve it. There is also extra challenges and community created puzzles if you want to keep playing after the main game is done, and it also has an interesting story."
268,2582,"Very challenging, but not in a frustrating way. It's super satisfying to see your solutions come to life. And then you can feel the same sense of satisfaction again by optimizing your solution for better and better times and efficiency. Overall one of the best puzzle games out there."
269,2582,Waited too long to play this.
270,2582,"The base campaign offers some average to hard level puzzles, and offers a decent amount of gameplay. The bulk of the replay value for this game comes from the ResearchNet puzzles; which are way harder than the campaign puzzles and may require some unconventional techniques to solve, and secondly from optimization of previously completed puzzles for time, number of symbols or reactors used. If you like Factorio and other thinking games you will most likely enjoy this."
271,2582,"Great game from Zachtronics that will keep you up trying to make the most efficient and elegant solutions.  If you enjoyed their more recent Opus Magnum, then you should really make sure you haven't overlooked this classic."
272,2582,"So you complete the tutorial (The first two planets, I think).And you might find the first level on planet 3 easy.But the next one isn't.And the one after that is hard.And before long, every new level looks impossible (except for the boss fights, ironically).And you still manage to beat them.It's a Zachtronics game.Nuff said."
273,2582,This is a puzzle game based on fake chemistry. You design a factory that connects building blocks to make the desired end products. It is quite difficult. It would be good if you could save your designs before you try something else. The best puzzle game that I have played.
274,2581,"i have played spacechem years ago on android for about 50hrsafter that, each and every puzzle/programming games, i would compared with spacechem.e.g. opus magnum is spacechem with better artwork but easier, less possiblity.human resources machine/7 billion people have more programming side than spacechem.infinifactory is spacechem in 3dautomata chef is a spacechem with food, and clumsier control.although it is not perfect, spacechem is a role model in puzzle game."
275,2580,"Still pretty much the best game ever, so long as zachlike puzzle/optimisation challenges are your jam."
276,2580,"I am nowhere near smart enough for this game, but I can see the merits it has."
277,2579,"Quite possibly the hardest puzzle game I have ever played. I've never actually beaten it. I keep deleting it then coming back 2 years later and getting a bit farther. That's my kind of game. It's probably not for everyone. (Those that like the satisfaction of completion and those that aren't nerdy enough to appreciate the premise). I love it. I'm looking for more games like this. I don't think this will help any coding skills, but if you enjoy coding as a fun challenge in your spare time, this is exactly the kind of thing you will like. It's very outside the box and the limitations are equally frustrating in a good way and forcing you to think outside the box (as long as the atoms don't go outside the box)"
278,2579,"Game very similar to building circuits. There's some programming aspect to it, but most of it is getting the timing down right. Game has serious QA issues. Search around for timing, random generation, differences between win/linux/osx games. Sometimes downright frustrating with bugs."
279,2577,"Very blurry on my 15in 4k, can barely read the symbols. There don't appear to be options available to fix this. I don't care about graphics but even the tutorial text is fuzzy.Will update review if I figure out how to fix it. Leaving comments open in case anyone has advice."
280,2571,"I thought my Chemical Engineering degree would help me finish this game in some extent, but apparently not......"
281,2570,"I really enjoyed it. An excellent problem-solving game that really challenged me, and it was a joy to solve. Still haven't beaten the last level, and looking forwards to keep trying."
282,2570,good
283,2569,This game is amazing.
284,2568,"Be ready to be stuck for hours on a level trying to figure out a smooth system to complete the level. Up for a challenge? This is a great puzzle game that doesn't necessarily require chemistry knowledge, so don't be scared off by the idea and looks of 'Space Chem'. It's fun to see how well you performed a level compared to other players! Be warned: this is not an easy game. The game gets harder very quick, but if you're the kind of person who likes to optimize logistical production-processes and management, this is the best puzzle  game you can buy!"
285,2567,The Music is amazing!
286,2566,"This is an amazingly fun game. At the start of most levels you really don't know what you can do to get the solution, but after some trials you create the most beautiful production lines. Just looking at your work afterwards is great and very rewarding. One of the best puzzle games I came across the last couple of years."
287,2565,Great puzzle game
288,2565,One of the best puzzle games. Especially interesting for engineers or people that like to build stuff. After 8 years the game still receives updates and has a nice community.
289,2564,"The tutorial sucks and i couldnt really figure out the first two real challenges, but a couple youtibe videos and it all started to make sense."
290,2563,"The game says ""enter your spacechem key."". Please help, Zachtronics?edit: FIXED! i enjoy the game."
291,2562,8 years and still being maintained.Also very replayable.Fun game by devs that care.
292,2562,The best problem solving game ever!
293,2562,I really love this game and sure you will like it if you want to brainstorming.
294,2560,Grossly inaccurate organic chemistry meets drag-'n'-drop circuit puzzles! Check your stereochemistry at the door (stoichiometry also questionable). Zachtronics' first and original Steam release for anyone who has an applied interest in the hard sciences. Note: No knowledge of chemistry whatsoever required. It's pseudochemistry for the visual programmer!
295,2560,"This game looks amazing. Sometimes i will stress out when i try for many times an level which it is hard,but in general it's a strategy game as physic and chemestry or science. When you see a map,click it and you find moustachium levels which if you complete it you will get TF2 Items to craft Fishcake and Spacechem Pin. At least i buyed the 63 Corvi DLC To finish the game,it's short don't worry. Anyways,i really like this game and i would recommend you this game and the DLC."
296,2559,is good
297,2559,"This game is amazing. It is difficult! Oh how it is difficult...Actually, it was the first time I thought I found a game that I'm too stupid for. But then with time I realized, everything can be learned.I sometimes go back to older levels just to find out how unillumined I actually had been at that time.Nothing beats the feeling when you finally - after hours of seemingly sitting motionless in front of a still screen - find THE elegant solution and yourself in the leftmost position of the bulk regarding cycles (sometimes).15 hours into the game and I am at level 11 of a minimum of 38, with an everlasting ramp up in difficulty. Looking forward to it :DIf you're afraid of chemistry, fear not, this game is more about logic and imagination (so far)."
298,2557,Be insecure and prove to the world that you're smart by playing this game.
299,2556,I failed chemistry in high school but this makes me feel like I finally understand.
300,2556,"Absolutely brilliant logic puzzle game, with some really tough mechanics."
301,2554,"SpaceChem is not really a game about chemistry or chemicals, so if you were looking for that you will be disappointed. It's a logic/puzzle/machine game where you make little ""assembly lines"" that turn things made of circles into other things. Those things happen to be molecules and atoms in the game, but it would make more sense for them to be mechanical parts or just plain blocks (like in infinifactory).While the 2d assembly-line puzzle aspect is well done, the game presents itself as a chemistry game although nothing you do in the game bears any relation to real chemical engineering. To make ammonia in the game you use your assembly line to place 3 individual hydrogen atoms around one nitrogen and then trigger your ""bond atoms"" device and ta-dah, you've ""assembled"" a single ammonia molecule from its component atoms.Concepts like activation energy, distillation, reduction/oxidation etc have no place here, it's basically programming a car assembly line but instead of a frame and four wheels you have a circle with a C and four circles with an H."
302,2553,"SpaceChem is a great puzzler game.  It seems simple at first but it quickly becomes devilishly tricky.  As a programmer its a good mental exercise because working with the circuits and waldos is a sort of visual programming.  I was surprised how many computer science concepts appeared: state machines, inter-thread communication and timing, producer/consumer, deadlock and starvation.  For more sophisticated, elegant solutions, you must know the system inside and out.  For example, you'll need to know the color priority of the waldos (some solutions wont work if you swap red and blue).  If a waldo hits a wall, it will repeatedly execute a command it's sitting on. Bonders also execute in a certain order which must be determined experimentally. Watch SpaceChem tournament videos on YouTube to learn these tricks and more. For harder problems, these details are not only convenient but necessary. If youre stuck on a problem, its not because youre not smart enough.  You may just need to better understand the system youre working with.  I like that after completing a puzzle, my solution will be compared to those of other players in terms of time, number of reactors, and instructions.  You can also see the individual scores of your friends.  A very satisfying puzzle game.  Have a fishcake and enjoy!"
303,2552,"Great game.  Open-ended, very challenging puzzles.  Fantastic music.  I prefer the simpler ""research assignment"" levels as they are fast and rewarding, whereas some of the other level types are more time consuming but don't feel any more enjoyable that the basic formula."
304,2551,Best Zachtronics game IMO.
305,2551,So hard but also so good.
306,2551,I recommend this game to all puzzle nerds who like a challenge... It really is a difficult game in the latter levels.
307,2551,Fun and difficult.
308,2551,It's a masterpiece !
309,2551,Incredibly simplistic but brutally complicated.
310,2551,It is a very challenging puzzle.
311,2551,Good puzzle game with an interesting setting. The gradual and well-balanced difficulty makes it approachable by everybody but I especially recommand it if you enjoy coding or doing maths.
312,2551,Enginerding galore
313,2550,It's chemically delicious.
314,2550,I'm a chemist. I love playing with chemistry.I'm a playchild. I love Space games. This game is neither of both.This game is a 100% straightforward and well-set up puzzle game.With the best background setting I could imagine.I'm loving it.
315,2550,All games from Zachtronics get YES from me.
316,2549,"Fantastic Puzzle game with very satisfying mechanics; however bad story and annoying ""boss fights"".Highly rewarding game overall."
317,2546,"Good game for the old brain-type organ.  Check it out when you wanna relax... I mean get stressed out, but in a different way than the shooters fps etc."
318,2546,"if you think you're smart, buy this game, and realize that you are not smart enough"
319,2545,it's like chemistry but in space
320,2545,"Highly challenging, but incredibly intresting and hugely rewarding when you figure out the puzzles!"
321,2542,"Really?  Zero user reviews?  I'm the best!So, I've had this game for a few years and play it on and off again.  The gameplay is two fold, making factories that assemble and disassemble molecules from or to atoms.  Outputs from factories are piped into inputs for other factories.  It's interface is easy to learn and there are keyboard shortcuts, which I appreciate.This game at its heart is a 2D puzzle game.  The scoring so to speak is based on three different optimization scales, fewest cycles, fewest parts, and fewest factories used.I found the story fun, with a tone of seriousness.  That and the music makes for nice atmosphere.  The game is challenging and thoughtful.So, let's look at the value defined as playtime, vs. advertised price ($10) at time of authroship (2018-SEP-25), 50h / $10 = 1h / $0.20.  We're calculating 20 cents an hour here, that's like 35 times better than a movie, and like 70 times better than a 3D movie, or new iTunes release.  Like puzzle games that make ya think?  Want to learn the periodic table of the elements and atomic numbers?  Fun game, 7/10 doesn't seem fair.  I would rate 8/10.  I haven't yet experienced an application fault with this game, which I think is sign of good programming, keep it up authors!"
322,2542,"I'm pretty sure this game is harder than TIS-100.While SpaceChem programs can have more than 15 instructions, the closest you get to comments is that you can diagram the ""molecules"" that you intend to be sent through each intermediate pipeline.  It can be quite tricky to find room for the instructions you need without causing your ""molecules"" to collide with one another or with the edges of the play area, which gets extremely frustrating up until you manage to squeeze everything in, but that just makes coming up with a tight design super-satisfying.  If simply solving a problem isn't enough for you, you can try to optimize your solution for speed, symbol count, and reactor count.  I've heard the histograms haven't been updated in a long time, but that doesn't make it any less satisfying to find your score to the left of a big bump in the graph.The ""production"" problems additionally require you to choose how to subdivide the problem into pieces you can tackle with the available reactor types, but on the other hand they allow you to choose how to subdivide the problem into manageable pieces.  However, if you can't come up with a good approach, you can often find a reddit comment where someone gives a hint describing a set of reactors in terms of their inputs / outputs and (in tricky cases) interconnections, and there's still plenty of satisfaction to be found in actually programming the reactors. (In one such case, I have yet to understand how the poster managed to make their implementation as inefficient as they say it is: apparently, their version has three atoms looping around getting fused up to Uranium, but I had enough trouble figuring out how to inject a second atom into the loop in my version when I realized that one Uranium was not enough.)P.S. If it wasn't clear by now, this game is definitely not about chemistry, it's merely chemistry-flavored.  (As are the fish sandwiches, which I do not think should be eaten under any circumstances whatsoever.)"
323,2542,"An amazing puzzle game! 10/10!This insidiously difficult logic game makes the essential elements of parallel programming accessible by wrapping them in an intuitive interface and creating a puzzle framework based on simplified inorganic chemistry.The puzzles ramp up in difficulty within the built-in constraints, with optimization problems to extend the difficulty for the truly hardcore.Many hours of mind-bending entertainment for brainiacs!"
324,2542,"Third time that i came up with a Solution only for the Game to go ""Nah can't do that"", but not explaining me why. So i keep trying and eventually get the ""Correct"" Solution throug trial and error without having learned anything new or gained a deeper understanding about it."
325,2540,SpaceChem hits all the right spots for me. I love logic and problem-solving and I love building automated solutions. It's worth every dime if you're the type of player who likes problem-solving. I'd recommend it to people who loved games like Human Resource Machine.
326,2538,"Satisfying puzzler. Eventually you'll feel like you're doing homework, but until that point it's good fun."
327,2537,This game drove me to murder
328,2537,"Great puzzle gameThe campaign gradually introduces new mechanics. Each chapter starts with an easy warmup assignment making you familiar with the newest mechanism after which the difficulty is amped up with each following assignment. Nice for accessibility, good for long term progression that brainbreakers are alternated with brainrelaxers.Although it's all about the puzzles, the campaign also has a storyline. I liked it but you can just skip the story if you're not into it.I find the campaign to be worth the listed price, but the game gives you more. Halfway the campaign, you get acces to ""Research Net"" which comprises of a collection of individual assignments.Should you get this game? Have a look at the images. If you think there's a chance you might like it: buy it!Warning: This game is way too good at killing time and all that dead time? It's never coming back..."
329,2536,"Works on Linux, thanks!"
330,2535,"SpaceChem is a puzzle game based around elements and alchemy, a common trend amongst Zachtronic's games.Notable Features: Puzzles are engaging and difficult with very little hand-holding. Story-wise, it's good; it's shown as small passages between levels. TF2 items: mostachium bars (6), space metal scrap, and ""fish"".   - These are only mere crafting ingredients for what you probably want:   1. The Fishcake: a reskined Dalokohs Bar that you craft in TF2. Rarely see anyone with this.   2. SpaceChem pin: only for it's description: ""<no employment record found>"""
331,2533,"Wow, this is one of my favourite puzzle games of all time.I might be a bit biased since I love programming, but even if I didn't I still think it would be one hell of a game. The systems are fun to use and manipulate, the learning and difficulty curve is pretty much on point, and the game (so far... I haven't even come close to beating it) introduces enough interesting mechanics to build on what the player has already learned which keep the game interesting. Not only that, but most puzzle games have one solution, which the player has to find. I'm not bashing this as an idea, some of my favourite games work this way, but SpaceChem feels special in that it pretty much gives the player a blank canvas with a goal, and leaves the player with their knowledge of the game and the elements they're given to get to that solution however they want. It has a level of creativity that most other puzzle games simply don't have, and I loved every second of it. As such, beating a level feels particularly satisfying as I beat it using MY solution, rather than just ""oh. that's what I was supposed to do. I guess that makes sense"". It's not even an illusion of creativity as several times I've been introduced to a new mechanic, not understood it (most of the stuff in this game takes time to wrap your head around) and just beat the level without even using the new mechanic, just using my previous knowledge. The visuals, while not artistically outstanding, are cool and get the message across, which is kind of the aim. The music is also very fun. Lore-wise, pretty bad. The story is given as text for the player to read in their spare time which is one of the worst ways to tell a story in games imo. I don't know if it's any good because I never bothered to read it, but I'm not gonna be harsh about it since when I bought SpaceChem I wasn't exactly thinking ""Oh boy, this should be an interesting story"". Lore isn't what I'm here for and it isn't what SpaceChem provides, which is fine.I may be a bit late to the party (somehow I never heard about the game until recently lol), but if you have any interest in puzzle games or like programming in any way I would certainly recommend giving this game a shot. (will update if I come across anything relevant later on)"
332,2533,"Honestly, this game is ridiculously hard. I'm not even that far in :'(Very cool tho"
333,2532,"Absolutely love this game, but there is one thing that bugs me so bad it is just the most annoying thing to make me take off stars and give it a thumbs down.  please tell me if Im missing it !   There is undo button but tehre is no button to reset the level so you can start over again without having to hit that undo button 30 times. If there is a way, it is definitely not intuitive or marked that I can see.  Now i'm older and my eye sight is not that great but that is crazy not to have that feature in a game like that.  i'm going to give this a thumbs down till I get some sort of answer or response from the devs.  When i do I will change my rating.  Other than that, I seriously love it. but that undo button makes my hands and arthritis really kick in.  it's just rediculous."
334,2532,"It's STRESSFUL, it's FRUSTRATING, it's CHALLENGING, it's DOWNRIGHT DIFFICULT at times. Some of the levels had me angry at how complicated they seemed, then even angrier when I was presented with a relatively simple solution. The game is mentally exhausting, increasingly complex and really just quite irritating.Absolutely loved it! 10/10."
335,2532,"boring, too complicated"
336,2532,"Clever concept, challenging gameplay, and the writing is actually surprisingly good."
337,2532,Very fun and addicting puzzel game. Warning: becomes very Hard!!! Deffinitly worth the price.
338,2531,"I know I'm late to the party (several years late) but I got this game in a Humble Bundle a couple of years ago, and have just now recently gotten into playing it.  It is the puzzle game I've been searching for.  As others have said, it is more of a programming game than a puzzle game, solving production problems in a limited environment with limited resources.  And your solutions are your own, potentially unique to anyone else's, which will solve the problem ... for additional challenges you can go back and optimize (cycle counts are monitored as well as 'symbol' use - where cycles are essentially how long your solution takes, and symbols' are the number of instructions required to carry out your solution in the graphical 'programming' interface).  It's cerebral, not tactical, and if you need a break from shooting up zombies this might be a good choice for you.  Or maybe check out the more recent Opus Magnum, which is next on my list to play when I've burned through SpaceChem.  It's the same, but different, with a much prettier graphical interface (though SpaceChem is perfectly serviceable and aesthetically pleasing as well."
339,2531,"First, I will reiterate what several reviews have said already: -If you like challenging puzzle games, buy this. -If you enjoy programming, definitely buy this. -You dont need to know anything about chemistry to play this game, nor will it teach you anything about chemistry.-The in game tutorial is awful but fret not, a much better one can be found here: Let's Look at Spacecehm-The game only plays in full screen if you fiddle with the DPI settings (only a minor annoyance).  Secondly I would like to point out the fundamental difference between Spacechem and most other puzzle games. Most puzzle games flow something like this: 1. you make a few failed attempts2. you hit a brick wall3. you muddle around aimlessly for a while4. you have a eureka moment5. success! Steps 2 and 3 are not fun...Because puzzles in Spacechem have a large number of workable solutions, you never hit that brick wall of what does the developer want me to do here?.Spacechem is less about eureka moments and more about breaking down each problem into smaller problems, then whittling away at those using cold hard logic. Over the course of this game I have been overwhelmed by some puzzles and mentally exhausted by others, but crucially I have never once been stumped."
340,2531,https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1251121226
341,2530,"If you like Shenzhen IO, this is a must buy."
342,2530,"It's not a bad game if you're into puzzle games. For me, it's a bit too much. The difficulty spikes really hard early on, to the point where I spent a good hour trying to solve a puzzle, took a break for a while, and realized while I was falling asleep that I had to completely re-do my solution to make it work. It's mind-bending. If you're into that, it's probably worth it for you. Otherwise, you'll just end up frustrated."
343,2530,"The first two planets/moons (7 games on first and 6 on second) are basically a tutorial on the basic mechanics and so are pretty trivial.  Then on the third planet/moon, called Danopath (a red one), it starts to get pretty challenging, so that is when the game gets really interesting.  This was a purchase I am quite happy with."
344,2529,"This is less ""learn chemistry in space"" and more ""learn multithreading using logic gates"", with a heap of ""I've played this game for 11 hours and I stopped playing for a few months, what the hell is any of this?""."
345,2527,"I don't think I've ever lost time to a game quite like this before. Oh, I've stayed up until the wee hours playing Civ 5. There have been games whose stories I couldn't tear myself away from. But if you're the kind of person who likes programming (and/or have ADHD like I do), this game can put you into a very intense kind of zen that you don't appreciate until you look at the clock and see that what felt like one hour was actually seven. I have forgotten to eat while playing this game. I have forgotten to sleep while playing this game. Take this as a recommendation and also a warning."
346,2526,"No proper tutorial, the link to it in-game is a dead one, but once you got your head around the interface (which can only be explained by third party tutorials) it's a great puzzler that, however, escalates way too fast.I can quite recommend it to anyone that is into puzzles though."
347,2525,"A really, really fun puzzle game if you like problem solving.Just when you think you've seen all the interesting mechanics involving Waldo's and atoms another one gets tossed into the mix, forcing you to solve old problems in different, more efficient, ways and allowing you to solve entirely new problems.Also, the amount of value you get for this game is insane."
348,2525,It's a good puzzle game
349,2525,Great puzzle/logic/undescribable game. I found this simply mindblowing.
350,2525,Great programmer puzzle challenges disguised as a chemistry game
351,2524,The best brain  I've had for years!
352,2523,"This was the fourth game I bought on steam, back in 2011. I bought this game as a 6th grader. I finished it as a college freshman.Now it's time to do the DLC."
353,2521,"This is a ZachTronics game.If you understand what I just said, or you like writing software, then stop reading reviews and go buy this game.If you don't understand what ZachTronics does, and you don't write software, then this game probably isn't for you.Most importantly, I beat the end boss, and optimized most of the level solutions. I built insane contraptions that would make any competent engineer vomit. I came, I saw, I got stuck on levels for weeks. I conquered. More than a review, this is a landmark of my accomplishments. That's the kind of game this is.10/10, would struggle again"
354,2519,"SpaceChem is probably a good game. I guess (TIS-100 was awesome). However, developers seem unable to:- set up a proper fullscreen mode on the monitor actually used by the system;- provide keyboard layout customization for non-Qwerty users;- load the tutorial video properly (they link to a youtube video and... it just fails?).In conclusion, the game becomes frustrating before you even begin to play. And then you just give up, not because it is too hard for you but because it is impossible to play fullscreen on your usual monitor (the default window is tiny and not resizeable - vector graphics, guys!)."
355,2517,"One of the greatest puzzle games of all time, period.A truly and honest-to-god mind-numbing experience at times, it's unbelievably astounding how your relatively small in-game toolbox can be utilized in so many ways. Yes, it can be an utterly frustrating experience when a solution you thought was perfect turns out to a completely stupid failure, but when you do finally hit upon the right logic and everything falls together you will feel like a genius.Then you hit the stats screen and some son of $&^(@ managed to do it in a quarter of the cycles, with one fewer reactor.A masterpiece. Everyone owes it to themselves to have this in their library."
356,2516,"The main problem with this game is that there isn't enough in-game help to understand the mechanics. There is no actual tutorial, just very brief written explanations, which for a game of this compexity is preposterous. Since you don't understand the mechanics fully, watching the solution of the levels where you got stuck doesn't really help. On a positive note, as it's already been said, the concept is good and the first few levels are enjoyable. I regret buying this game."
357,2516,"Genius. Pure genius! This game takes a boring sounding theme such as chemistry and makes it incredibly fun. It takes the pure essence of programming - the most fun parts and engages us to use them to solve puzzles. You are only allowed to use about 10 commands, but it's enough to make the game extremely challenging. It took me hours to solve some of the puzzles. However, be warned: It becomes very difficult very fast. And also one thing about bugs. I have been playing for 35 hours when I am writing this review. I have not found a single bug! (And I have been working as QA for over a decade)"
358,2515,"At first the game introduces simple, easy to grasp mechanics and you have fun putting nice shapes together.However, very quickly you find that these mechanics have snowballed into a mess of complexity and insane shapes.Best game ever"
359,2514,"Amazing game so far, only a bit into it bit I can tell I'm going to enjoy getting confused at this game. I expect a hard learning curve at some point and can't wait for it."
360,2512,"Buy this game ! Pay full price even, it is worth it. Very tough puzzles, but satisfying and unique."
361,2512,Excellent logic puzzle
362,2512,"Don't know why all the negative reviews lately. If you like puzzles, this is an amazing game. If you don't, then don't buy it because you will have a bad time. Also, RTFM."
363,2511,"Top notch game to train your brain! Fricking lost in it, have no idea what to do but learning fast! LOVE IT!"
364,2511,"Ranking this down because the UI help is getting in the way of playing the actual game.No control to dismiss the help so I can actually see the game board.I will re-rate if this is addressed. When I think of the UI more than the game, then it's an automatic thumbs down."
365,2510,"SpaceChem is a serious puzzle game.  The difficulty ramps up rapidly and the challenges are just that...challenging.  Each planet starts with a few ""research"" excercises that introduces a new feature, eg fusion.  A series of simpler tasks get the player acquinted with the new technique.  Then a series of production challenges that apply what was learned in ""research"" on a much larger scale.  Lastly, a timed challenge will require not only a correct solution, but a correctly timed solution.  Then it's time for a new planet that will require everything you just learned plus much more.I've spent hours engrossed sketching on paper trying how the molecules should flip and bond and drop so the next reactor will function.  I've scrapped entire lines of reactors as I've realized my clever idea just wasn't clever enough.  Nonetheless, it's those failures that leads to hilariously contrived successes and many more beloved hours of game play."
366,2510,"Game stopped working at all right at the second start (sadly right after the two weeks regarding refund). Uninstall/Reinstall does not help. Error log shows gibberish stack traces and non-helpful ""message"" about a libnative.so, which it allegedly can not find, but it is right there, where Steam installed it. Can not recommend at all.Edit: After some guess-work and search engine foo, I found the answer. The problem is 32bit mono on 64bit Linux. Even in multilib environments the game is not able to start properly. The devs apparently know about this issue since late 2012 (that's five years!) and don't resolve it, although the solution seems to be as easy as providing the installed startup script with a different LD_LIBRARY_PATH.Now, knowing this, I can only keep up my ""Not Recommended""."
367,2509,"This is quite simply one of the greatest games ever made!Conceptually brilliant, undeniably difficult and highly rewarding, this game requires a combination of brain power and determination to triumph over these seemingly impossible puzzles.If you're after a fun, casual game worthy of telling your friends about, look elsewhere. In fact, I wouldn't recommend any attempt to explain this game to anyone, as you might notice a fairly swift decline in your social status. Instead, play this in a dark room, alone (or with someone you trust with this level of information) and prepare for one hell of a challenge."
368,2509,Great value/price
369,2508,"The idea behind this game is fun and the first few levels are pretty enjoyable. Unfortunately, the problems it throws at you quickly become complex to the point of frustration. And the game doesn't exactly go out of its way to provide you with the information, tools, or explanations you might need to deal with it."
370,2507,"Basically one of the best extremely difficult puzzle games in existence. I also only found out that the main character was male on the seventh world, so there's that."
371,2506,"Spacechem is a puzzle game based on the idea of combining and dissasembling molecules using instructions (not too unlike a program) for the process to be carried out. No worries though, no knowledge of chemistry or programming is required! The game does a wonderful job of starting with easy problems and then scaling it up as you exhibit mastery over concepts. It also doesn't have a unique solution for every puzzle and so it encourages creativity. After finishing a level you can see how your solution compares to others in its efficiency and use of resources.My single complaint was that in the very beginning there were some mechanics that weren't quite clear to me. As a result I had to look at some solutions on youtube. That's probably me being dense more than anything wrong with the game though, and I figured out everything I needed in just a few minutes.Spacechem is an absolute blast and is hands down the best puzzle game I have ever played. Even if puzzle games aren't your thing, yet here you are looking through the comment section because you are considering buying it, just do it. You won't regret it."
372,2506,I'm about half way through it and loving it so far! C H E M I S T R Y   I N   S P A C E   ! ! ! ! ! !
373,2506,"You have to be a nerd (like me) to like this gameThat said, by the time you get to the later levels, some of the challenges feel more like work than fun.  It's not that I can't figure it out, its just that I don't care to put in the effort with that stupid fuser.Still its cool that it tracks how well players do in the game and you cna see if your solution is brilliant or bad.If you like brainteasers this may be worth your time.  Be warned though, some of the later levels get brutal."
374,2506,"I thought this game was about chemical reaction.... Nope. Fake chemistry. It starts off simple, and gets more and more complex. Very few had reached the end.As of this edit, I've reached the end. It took me around 55 hours to complete this game (without the DLC).Gameplay: Zach-like-grade quality.Story: http://www.zachtronics.com/spacechem-story (Spoiler Alert!)Graphics: Coming for the story only? See above instead.Playtime worth: You can refund the game back if you just copy-pasted the solutions.  hours otherwise. I beat the game in less than 80 hours.Remarks: You can fight against the Illuminati! Also, I made a missile out of water."
375,2505,*mind blown*
376,2505,"Next to Opus Magnum, this is my extremely close second favorite puzzle game. It gets to be very hard at points and has very unique concepts, including building multiple loops onto itself and, what completely blew me away, is it has BOSS FIGHTS! Yes, real, proper boss fights, in a puzzle game. And they are good.If you enjoy puzzle games and are somewhat competent at them, buy this game right now."
377,2505,"This is a great, fun, engaging, timeless game.It doesn't have anything to do with chemistry other than the aesthetic. It's more like... assembly programming. If you enjoy optimizing code, you'll adore this game. Otherwise, it lives up to the glory of Atomix.The game's story is horrifying, but you can ignore it and just focus on the game. :)"
378,2504,Great.
379,2504,"At first I found the videos/images silly looking, but the price was right so I bought it.Now that I've played a few hours, I know for sure that I'm going to spend a LOT more time on this. It's great fun. It's logic puzzles that can be solved creatively. No need for a major tutorial. Everything seems really hard at first, then you figure it out and its super satisfying.Just as if not more satisfying as Hexcells."
380,2504,"Brilliant!There's a level called ""No Ordinary Headache"". Why most levels are not called this as well is a mystery."
381,2504,There isnt any explanations in this game
382,2504,"You will get angry.  You will give up.  You will be back for more.This game is hard.  It's wonderfully hard.  Just when you think a puzzle is impossible and you decide to walk away, a little light goes off in the back of your brain and you're sucked back in to give it one more try.  Success is incredibly gratifying - I feel like a genius each time I finish a level for about 7 seconds before being completely stumped by the next challenge.  The mechanics continually evolve as you work through each set of levels, so while the overarching premise is simple and seemingly repetitive, completing each level is progressively more challenging, infuriating and rewarding."
383,2504,"Very interesting logic puzzle game. Worked well on Ubuntu Linux 16.04 (one small video glitch). If you like algorithmic thinking challenges, then you will probably adore SpaceChem. You will learn about chemistry, but this is not exactly realistic chemistry, since SpaceChem molecules are made by connected each atom to another atom, but it is an interesting workflow process game. I thought the gameplay, the tutorials, and the story were all interesting. I am not sure that the music was much of anything, but it was a nice touch, I suppose. I had it all muted within minutes. I did find the game too difficult mid-game, and the setting up of the engine took too long to experiment with different ideas. Overall, I felt like I got a whole lot more than I expected from SpaceChem. You can try out a game demo, and see what you think. I look forward to trying all of the other games that this developer has created."
384,2504,"SpaceChem is a great game for those who seek challenge in problem-solving puzzles. The puzzle objective is to convert the given chemical compound inputs into the wanted outputs in a sequential manner with the available tools on the board. Everything may be confusing at first, but once you understand how the basic things work, the fun starts here.The puzzles are open-ended, so it allows more than one valid solutions to solve the puzzle. It's up to you if you want to just solve the puzzle or to optimize as best as you can to get an elegant solution. As you progress through the game the more complex the puzzles will be. Also, whenever you reached a new world, the game will introduce a new game elements. The difficulty spike can be really steep at some points of the game, so be prepared to spend a LOT of time to solve a single puzzle.Beaten the story mode already? Try the 63 Corvi DLC and ResearchNet puzzles for even more challenges. This game also includes the Moustachium level pack that gives you TF2 items upon completion (let's be honest, you are probably getting this game for the TF2 items). It also has a level editor so you can share custom levels with your friends.There might be a small bug like when you try to copy someone's solution it did not worked as intended, but nothing major. Overall, this game is really solid. 9/10"
385,2503,"I've spent 30 minutes with this game, and I can already tell that it's a masterpiece.  How on Earth did I let this slip by for 7 years!?!?"
386,2503,this game is awesome
387,2503,"Really great game.  Puzzles are totally open ended and give tremendous satisfaction from solving them.  The game design is incredibly simple yet very deep.  Its not just a matter of completing the levels - its often more fun to simply watch and improve the solutions you have, and the post-level histograms do a great job of incentivizing this.The game is really great at being an educational game without being an educational game.  It manages to teach complex concepts in a way which are broad enough to be applicable to real world design.  For example, basics of parallel processing are taught in some form or another youll encounter race conditions, synchronization issues, waiting/locking, etc These lessons are introduced gradually and organically; first by the use of the two waldos on a single job, and later emphasized in levels which you handle multiple reactors.More generally, the game also does a great job of teaching about design compromises.  Its almost always impossible to minimize symbol usage, reactor usage, and speed, so youll have to choose which to optimize for.The only downside is that it can feel like work.  Granted, its a magic version of work thats always leading towards rewarding, lightbulb-over-the-head moments.  But still, I find it kind of mentally wearying to play for extended periods of time, particularly on the more challenging levels.  I do imagine that probably a lot of people might be uninterested in this kind of game, but for those who like it, it provides an incredibly rewarding and deep experience."
388,2501,"Do you like puzzles?Do you get antsy if there exists a puzzle you have attempted but have not solved?Do you live and breath the cycle of ""Haha I finally did it after two hours, let me glance at the next puzzle""Do I have a game for you."
389,2501,Nobody finishes this game.
390,2501,Quite a simple idea but gets the old brain ticking and you learn a bit of chemistry at the same time.
391,2501,"Still trying to figure this Game out, but is fun with great effects.A+A+A+A+A+ for this Purchase."
392,2500,"Not good for win10. Can not auto fit the scree size. Didn't have a chance to play it cause nearly 20% of the screen is blocked. If I use full screen, than 50% is blocked."
393,2500,This game is awesome
394,2500,Love Blueprint Tycoon. Love SpaceChem.
395,2500,Visual Programming Simulator 10/10
396,2499,"This is one of my favorite puzzle games of all time. I still think about it years later.I'll also never beat it without looking up guides, but that's OK."
397,2499,Always weird when you have an idea for a game only to find out someone has already done it better.
398,2499,"Pros:-Interesting mechanics-Neato space theme-Good difficulty curve, introduces new mechanics at good paceCons:-Did not prepare me for actual reaction engineering course (Still got like a B or something)Overall 9/10 Would not recommend for actual chemical engineering curriculum."
399,2499,Difficult but rewarding puzzle game!
400,2499,"A challenging puzzle game with always more than one solution, some more efficient than others. Pretty satisfying when you figure something out, but some of the stages can get quite difficult to even wrap your head around. I've gotten maybe 80% of the way through (after 25 hours)"
401,2499,Playing this game results in the Perfect Chemistry of fun.
402,2499,"An oldy, but a goody.Can get hard in later levels, but very rewarding once you solve them."
403,2499,"I wanted to die at first, but it just kept coming back into my mind, I had to finish it."
404,2499,"If you like puzzle games, certainly worth a shot."
405,2499,"This game is a lot of fun and very challenging, though the difficulty might be due to my lack of knowledge in chemistry.  Each level you are given a puzzle to solve, and the puzzles become increasingly more complex as they rely on your ingenuity and originality in placing instructions and commands for atomic reactors to function and process molecules.  The instructions you give the reactors works sort of like a code, though everything is physical and tangible on your screen, at least on the level of circuit building.  You cannot make devestating mistakes, but you can edit and revise the programming limitlessly and there are infinite possibile solutions to each puzzle.  The real grind comes down to making fastest solution with the least amount of instructions."
406,2499,An brilliant and extremly challenging game. The puzzles take some time to solve but solving them makes you feel like a genius.
407,2499,"Gets really hard real fast, but still fun"
408,2499,An awesome logic puzzle!
409,2499,It's old.It's weird.It's hard.I suck at it.And I totally love it.Try it!
410,2499,Nice brain 
411,2499,"Really great game. It makes you waste several hours to complete a single level, makes you fell like an idiot, but it gives you a deep satisfaction after completing it."
412,2499,Fantastic logic based puzzle game.
413,2499,"10/10 logic based puzzle game.If you hate engineering, logic, puzzle games or sitting on a puzzle for hours: stay away.Otherwise: This game is amazing."
414,2499,Do you want to feel like an idiot?Because I thought all puzzle games are easy peasy before I booted up SpaceChem. This stuff is TOUGH
415,2499,"I didn't need to play for long to realize how great this game is. The satisfaction of creating an efficient design is so satisfying,"
416,2499,The positive and negative reviews basically state the same thing.. this game makes you think hard. Finding solution might take several hours and then you can move to another level where something even more challenging awaits you.If you have job which is utilizing your brain enough it's not easy to find the will to play this game and solve the levels withouth getting paid for it. But if you are bored in school / job / prison / retirement this is the right game for you.
417,2499,Random Comment to get a Badge
418,2499,"This is a wonderful game that really makes you think. I recommend having a dry-erase board close by while playing, you'll need it."
419,2499,Nice little brain teaser. Be careful not to get lost in it though. Time flies and hours pass without being noticed when you puzzle out how to make your reactions even more efficient and faster.
420,2498,Great for programmers. The story has you do some really silly things if you pay enough attention.
421,2498,Awesome headbuster with a good story and intuitive way of learning chemistry (and a bit of programming!)
422,2498,"This game owns your brain in one of the most dirty ways. And again. And again. And again. And after a long break, you launch it again only to have your brain bent and blended in attempts to solve yeet another puzzle. And then you become unable to solve a puzzle. Your brain stops functioning. It refuses to work. You decide you need a break. And you go to previous levels to improve your solutions. Make them better. Faster. Cheaper. More efficient.And again. And again. And again...And again...And again..."
423,2498,I love how this game can make you feel so dumb and so genious at the same time
424,2498,"If I'd ever complete this game I'll throw a party, you are all invited 9/10  -   ,  ,   "
425,2498,"If solving tricky programming puzzles sounds more like fun than work to you, you will absolutely love this game, or any game by this developer."
426,2497,I genuinely thought this game was gonna be difficult and boring at first until I really got into it! Thankfully I very much wrong and instead I ended up enjoying said game. SpaceChem is a challenging and difficult game but that is the point ^w^ I would like to see a possible sequel to this game in the near future!
427,2497,"Very Hard, but worth it.."
428,2497,"Not any easy game, but vary fun I do like a good puzzel game and this is what it is lots of stuff to do I like the 8 bit style of the game the music is amazing the story is rich and most of all there are TF2 items (Still a good game with out the TF2 items)."
429,2497,This doesn't help you with chemistry. But it is a truly inspired puzzle game.
430,2496,Good game.
431,2496,"This is the first Zachtronics game I've played, and I'm really liking it. There are other people who have already explained the details of the game in their reviews, so I'll just state my opinion and leave it at that."
432,2495,"Wow! space chem is one of the best puzzle game I've played in a while! It's challenging yet simple to understand. I would highly recommend it to any people searching a new kind of puzzle experience.A really tiny little down: the story is hard to follow (at least for me) since it's only text (sometimes quite long) and I didn't really want to read long text between each puzzle, so I gave up on the story. But anyway, I don't play this kind of game for the story ;)"
433,2495,This game makes me feel intelligent.
434,2495,I may never complete it but I recommend it to anyone who likes a challenge.
435,2494,One of my best gaming experience ever!
436,2494,"One of the best puzzle games I have played in a long time. It is challenging and rewarding when you successfully program multiple reactors, and they do not fail. The difficulty curve is perfect. I was not able to beat the game, but the time enjoyed has been worth it. I picked it up 75% off but it is worth full price."
437,2493,The best and most challenging puzzle game on steam. Hands down.
438,2493,"What is SpaceChem?SpaceChem is a chemistry-themed programming puzzle game (no actual chemistry or programming knowledge required).Spacechem is moving stuff from one side of the screen to the other while rearranging it a bit.Spacechem isn't finding the unique solution, it's creating your unique solution.Spacechem is the elegance of a brilliantly simple solution.Spacechem is the elegance of a solution you know is a terrible wall of spaghetti, but it's your wall of spaghetti, dammit!Spacechem is accidentally late nights.Spacechem is a way to enjoyably fill the empty time in your day. Not just while actively playing, but a way to occupy your brain during those boring, spare minutes while trying to fall asleep, while doing mindless tasks, etc.Spacechem is finally deciding to go to sleep, only to jump out of bed as you were about to drift off, compelled by a sudden idea for how to solve that one level.Spacechem is the beautiful dance of atoms across the screen in a running solution.Spacechem is occasionally discovering little details of how the game mechanics work that can improve your solutions, because honestly, the tutorial levels don't do *that* great a job explaining everything.Spacechem is a string of head-scratching moments and eureka moments.Spacechem is the satisfaction of improving an old solution using what you've learned since.Spacechem is thinking your solution knocked a level out of the park, only to indignantly re-approach it when you discover that your friend did it in *how* many cycles/symbols?!Spacechem is a fairly reasonable difficulty curve, but the difficulty curve also doesn't stop right up until the end of the game.Spacechem is a very difficult game to beat (3.8% completion rate).Spacechem is getting distracted from progressing in the game because you'd rather improve previous solutions, or dive into the player-submitted ResearchNet levels (and because Boss levels aren't as fun as other levels).Spacechem is solving levels without the waldos leaving the input areas, just for the hell of it and because the solutions inevitably look cool.Spacechem is trying to solve challenging levels in a community tournament.Spacechem is accidentally upping your steam 'hours played' count by leaving the game running in the background, only to jump back into it every once in a while with a few small changes. Sorry, steam stats.Spacechem is guiltily getting around to beating the game and getting those last couple of achievements when you notice your hours-count is past 1000, because you were too distracted by all the other interesting things to do in the game.Spacechem has, for all practical purposes, endless replay value.Spacechem is the best puzzle game I've ever played."
439,2493,"An extraordinarily difficult and rewarding puzzle game.As with other Zachtronics titles, you're essentially solving programming problems with novel game-specific tools and mechanics, in this case customizing chemical reactors and pipelines to produce desired outputs from the given inputs. There are usually several tutorial levels to get you started when you have to learn how to use a new tool, but the difficulty quickly ramps up, making finishing each 'world' quite a challenge.It's certainly not for everyone, but if you enjoy puzzle games and are looking for something you can really sink your teeth into, I highly recommend picking this up."
440,2493,"I thought Dark Souls was hard... ;)This is the most complex puzzle ""simulator"" I played so far. Impossibly difficult, tons of levels. Definitely an aquired taste, only for the most hardcore of masochist, or for people who like to spend half an hour copying solutions from a youtube video just to get stuck on the next level ^^The mechanics itself are interesting enough, but the puzzles are just way, way, way to complicated and tedious. Could have been a really fun game, with better levels and a more guidance."
441,2492,"Very fun and addicting. with an extremely quick learning curve, but also a quick difficulty curve."
442,2492,"An excellent puzzle game with a great learning curve! It got me hooked immediately. Incredibly good value for money! I didn't mind the story much, but went straight from puzzle to puzzle.The main campaign was too difficult for me in the end -- after spending several hours in 4 levels, I used help from the web. A bit frustrating unfortunately. The DLC campaign made up for it with challenging but solvable puzzles :-)"
443,2492,"I have put in many hours into this game, it's one of my top 3 games.  There is no ""one"" solution to any puzzle, and you will have to come up with your own unique way of solving each one.  It's very interesting how the methods for solving puzzles differ from person to person.  The game does get very hard by the end, it took me a full day to solve the final one.  If you are on the fence, download the demo which has half of the ""worlds""."
444,2490,"This ""game"" requires you to perform tedious, relatively boring work, with no rewards in term of entertainment value. I play and enjoy all kind of games, from a variety of genres. But when I play a game, I expect to be entertained and to have fun playing it. This thing does not even come close to achieving that. I am not sure who would consider this ""fun"", and who are the people writing positive reviews for it. But I would suggest that these people should maybe go out more, meet some humans, make some friends..."
445,2489,"SpaceChem is one of those puzzle games people will be playing long after development has stopped, which is happening no time soon. This is one of the hardest and most satisfying coding puzzle games out there. Pros:-difficulty of puzzles leads to a huge sense of satisfaction when completed-lots of levels-you get items in TF2 -subtle chemistry education-engrossing, if arbitrary, story-helpful tutorialsCons:-music is repetitive-graphics can be a bit of an eyesore-lots of levels-new players will never be able to figure out the last two Moustachium puzzles, as they're infinitely harder than the two previous-Fishcake is a bit dry-got Australium poisoning from handling so much raw MoustachiumBut really, this game is fantastic overall. Get it on sale if you can, and make it a personal challenge to beat it. The rewards will speak for themselves."
446,2488,"Nice game. Unfortunately, i'm dumb.10/10 would feels like my brain explode again."
447,2487,nice game for relaxing
448,2486,Reaction ErrorReviewing is not allowed. The reaction will be stopped.
449,2485,I love playing this game. I hate not being able to solve a puzzle. I love it when I solve it. I hate it when I see much better solutions by others. I guess I have a love-hate relationship with this game.
450,2485,I love chemistry :(
451,2484,"Anyone who can understand and beat this game has my respect. It is very elegant and easy to learn, but the complexity is maddening once you get past the first few planets. Too hard for me, but it's still a good game. Give it a go if you think you're up for the challenge, just be prepared to tryhard as you never have before."
452,2483,This game is great and really gets you thinking about how to solve some of the puzzles especially at the end of the second planet/moon but in the end (atleast at that bit) isnt that hard and im only on the 3rd planet/moon atm btw.Also theres 3 missions if you could call them that that will reward you with promotional items for tf2 when you beat them which you can then use wont spoil what they are even though everyone probably knows anyway amazing game I really reccommend buying this game and its only 6.99 aswell also heres a challenge.Beat those 3 levels that give you your tf2 stuff without looking up how to do them and you have to do it first time meaning you cant have already done those levels and gotten your loot for tf2
453,2483,"This is the most challenging puzzle game I have yet played.  The graphics are superior.  The words are a little difficult to read on smaller screens.  It takes me several hours to solve the mid-level puzzles.  This is not a game that you can speed through and reach the end.   There is no time limit, which I like, because studying the playing field and seeing the solution develop is part of the fun.  This is very enjoyable if you like thinking and experimenting with possible solutions to turning water into higher elements and compounds, using fusion, bonding, and separation of molecules.  Each level adds more features to the possible manipulation of atoms and molecules."
454,2482,"I can apreciate this game might not be every persons cup of tea, but personally I love it. As a player you are given great flexibility in solving the puzzles (cutting up and putting together various molecules in ""reactors"") but the biggest contraint for me is myself; since your score at the end of a level is evaluated with all other players. There is always this added difficulty in trying to make the sollutions as efficient as possible.The music is not bad at all, but the game has nothing special in the way of sound, but this is no real hinderance since I play my own music while playing. The learning curve is quite steep so take time in the first levels to just mess around with the game to see what can and cannot be done.Only downside I suppose is that the speed of the reaction once running is still quite fast; I would have preferred if it could be turned down a notch or so for when I'm testing. Apart from that a nice game."
455,2481,"fun and chalanging... still to this day not finished it, solved all but the last 2 planets..."
456,2481,Really makes you use your brain. Plus extra points for the amazing soundtrack.
457,2480,This game will take over your brain.
458,2480,People who have done LabVIEW and Assembly languages will trully appreciate the beauty of this game. A paradigm of dataflow programming with a minimal command set. This game is an art in its own category.
459,2480,the hardest game I've ever played
460,2479,"It's quite satisfying to build a factory and see it working to perfection.Great game up to a point, but eventually the difficulty level gets ridiculous. If it takes me hours to beat a level, and my only reward is to unlock an even harder level, the game turns into work.At some point a puzzle game has to choose between getting incredibly difficult, or lowering the difficulty, but introducing a new concept for the player to learn. I prefer the new concept approach, but obviously this game went with the difficulty approach."
461,2479,"I purchased this game on sale, because I remembered you could get items in Team Fortress 2 by playing it. The gameplay was challenging, I needed the help of a Steam guide completed.The story, however, is what surprised me. I will not spoil anything, as I reccomend you play it yourself.Do I reccomend the game? Yes, if not for the gameplay, then the story."
462,2478,One of the best games to challenge problem solving skills. I personally find it extremely fun because of that reason.
463,2478,My favorite puzzle game ever! Game mechanics are very original and finding an interesting solution by yourself is so rewarding!
464,2478,fome :3
465,2478,SO  FUN. LEARNED HOW TO COOK METH. METH HELPS ME PLAY MORE. LEARNING MORE METH RECIPES. THIS GAME IS AMAZING
466,2478,One of the best puzzle games I've ever played.
467,2477,"Less daunting than it seems and very fun if you like logic puzzles. The game subtly pushes you towards making elegant solutions by having leaderboards that show your friends' metrics (how many cycles/steps their solution took, how many reactors they used, how many logic symbols it took), which adds another layer to the challenge. It's the kind of game where I'll be stumped by a problem and will walk away, think about it over the course of the day, and then come back and try out some of the solutions that I'd thought about. A lot of trying and failing and refining until you come up with something that works. In a sense it's a primer for Zachtronics' later programming and engineering games, as it was where they first developed the underlying programming-esque gameplay that drives them. I guess what I'm saying is that if you like or think you might like programming, you'll probably like this."
468,2477,very good challenging puzzle game
469,2477,"I absolutely love this game.  It starts off easy enough, teaching you the basics, then really ramps up the difficulty.  This is a critical thinking game, and I love it.  I love tackling the analytical problems this game presents.  I work as a software developer, and I view these puzzles as little programs I'm writing."
470,2477,Incredibly challenging. The difficulty of the requirement expodes as you continue playing the levels.
471,2477,"Well worth the cash, lots of fun if you like to think and experiment."
472,2477,More satisfying than sex.
473,2477,Great puzzles and fun to optimize (though a bit maddening if you try to understand all the bugs and glitches). The two waldos moving around is a great balance between programability and challenge. Definitely would recommend.
474,2477,"Awesome game, Finally a good puzzle game that makes you use your brain."
475,2475,"Did I really spend 51 hours on this? Unbelievable. It is very interesting, especially if you're a fun of puzzle games. Love it. Not easy and I hate when games are easy, where's the fun in that?"
476,2475,"Tedious is the only word that can describe it. I dropped after multiple reactor stages started, as  testing/debuging your solution requires waiting for input (from previous reactor) to be produced and arrive. It should have topology in tags instead of programming as it more about solving geometric constraints instead of creating code."
477,2474,"I really love puzzle games. They stuck me in, and usually don't let me go until I solved them. However, I haven't found a good one until recently.When I first bought this game I didn't have the time to play, not even on my mobile. I recently installed it and gave it a try. I logged out 6 hours later.This puzzle is the rare kind that have a relatable backstory. You don't have to read it to advance in the game, and it's not forced down your throat. It's nice and relatable, especially for people who worked at a high tech firm before.The tutorials could be a bit more interactive, or at least animated. Some controls are well hidden, and never explained throughout the game. The graphics are OK, it's not beautiful. Well, it is, if you are into retro gaming, but given it's 2017 and you are playing as an employee of a space age high tech firm, it's pretty low. However, you spend most of your time on the reactor screen, which is pretty good.Controls are OKish. You can't customise the keys, though, so unless you like to play dragging and dropping, prepare for the standard WASD keys (and you still need your mouse). Oh, you are using Dvorak or Colemak, or another esoteric layout? Then you should stick to your mouse.The puzzles, however, are really nice. You occasionally get an easy one, that can be solved in minutes. But then you get an insane one you spend hours to figure out, without finding a solution. Oh, did I mention there is no easy way to start over? I really miss a reset button.All in all, this is a very good game. I can spend countless hours without even realising it. You should definitely try it."
478,2472,The standard by which all other puzzle games will be judged
479,2472,"Great puzzle game. Very complicated, especially for those of us that do not know how to program (aka don't understand how to design a state machine)."
480,2470,"For those among you who enjoy complex puzzle games, SpaceChem is a good choice.  The basic rules and mechanics are very easy to pick up and understamd, but can be used in very sophisticated ways in order to make optimal solutions for the puzzles.The core game on it's own contains a large number of levels that are broken down into 3 major types:* Research Assignments (the 'simplest' type, which all takes place in a single chemical reactor).* Production Assignments (In which the problem is hard enough to require multiple reactors).* Defence Assigntments (Which basically play much in the same way as Production Assignments, with the added caviat that you have time pressure in the form of some eldrich horror trying to destroy the facility).It has a neat little story about your career at SpaceChem whose chapers unlock as you progress through the game. In addition, once you've made it through the game the ResearchNet allows you to access user-made puzzles, of which there is a very large number, giving plenty of replay value."
481,2469,"I really enjoy games like this where you have to mechanically program cycles of operations to reach the desired output. I also played Infinifactory which is similar to this. It has a good balance of giving you some freedom to come up with different solutions, but not getting too complex like a full programming language. The achievements are also well balanced where they make you think and plan out a solution, but definitely doable.There are lots of levels and an interesting text-based story line. The boss fight levels where you're under attack are fun too.10/10 would get slapped by giant tentacles again."
482,2469,"I don't trust any space agency. They are all lying. No one has ever been to space. It's that simple. Not saying space isnt real, but I know stars, the sun, and moon are not what they are taught to be. Further more, once you learn that no curvature can be detected on Earth from any experiment, and you learn Earth is flat, you really start to get a good perspective on how just about everything that is taught is complete hogwash, along with history.Check out this book in link below. Curvature cannot be detected. No matter how hard you look. It doesn't take much common sense to put two and two together. The problem is, no one wants to actually do the research. They just see the words 'flat earth' and turn livid; because, we've been brainwashed by this lie since we could speak. It's normal to reject it at first, but if you do not research it for yourself, then you're just cheating yourself. Modern science is a religion and it takes faith to believe in all these theories that are needed in order to support more theories. Did you know gravity is still just a theory that needs the theory of relativity to be true for it to be possible? Just look it up.The book is called, ""Earth Not A Globe"". Check link below for free download. Also, look up ""Convex Earth The Documentary"". We've been lied to. Once you can accept that, then you can see the world with new eyes, and everything begins to make more sense. No one has ever been to space, and modern science is a religion which takes faith to believe in.https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9l1TmVd_S5gR2hKUl9uNzBIVmc"
483,2468,"original, amazing"
484,2468,it's okay
485,2468,"SpaceChem is basically its own genre of puzzle game. Each level requires you to program the ""waldos"" (the red and blue circles) to move input molecules around a screen and create different molecules as output. As you progress in the game, more commands are introduced which allow you to use the waldos in more interesting or more efficient ways. I played this game for 92 hours, more than any other game in my account, to beat every level and obtain the 20 achievements. It has remained challenging and engaging throughout, and I have never played a game quite like it.What really distinguishes SpaceChem from puzzle games in general is that it is open-ended. It feels like you are inventing a solution, not finding it. For any given puzzle you will find people who have implemented a solution and optimized it in dozens of conceptually different ways. Speaking of optimization, it's important to mention that the creators made optimization totally optional. Yet, I have found that some of my most satisfying moments playing the game were getting some highly optimized solution to work (e.g. with just one reactor, or with a tiny number of symbols) after hours of effort.As far as programming games go, a major strength of the game (over, for instance, TIS-100) is how visually intuitive it is. Everything is executed by the waldos moving around the screen; nothing is hidden from you. Debugging your program is simply a matter of watching what happens when you click ""run"". You don't really have to read what the rules are, as you just learn them by experimenting.I do have some negative things to say. I am not alone in complaining that the boss fights are not as enjoyable; especially the very last level, which was made difficult in a number of annoyingly artifical ways and ultimately made me take a few months away from the game. Having beat it, I appreciate it a bit more, but the limited space for the reactors was just unnecessary. In general, I think that I enjoy small, elegant puzzles a lot more (which I can then go and optimize), rather than these 5- or 6-reactor messy puzzles where the solution is to put a whole bunh of easy pieces together into a working contraption, and debug it."
486,2467,"fantastic game, it's like crack for programmers"
487,2467,"Spacechem is a fun game. There's no denying that. You get to use sophisticated technology to design molecules for a company and fight monsters and all sorts of weird stuff using your head.But what they didn't tell you is that you're actually working for Syria. It all makes sense now, doesn't it? It's ingenious. Have you ever heard of Ender's game? We're secretly designing molecules for Syria so they can come closer and closer to nuclear armament. So please, put this game down now before it's too late. The Syrians are THIS close to achieving nuclear fission, all they need is for a few more simulations to be run by the likes of us hungry players, we have to stop this together. Alert the FBI, CIA, your grandmother, and the president, because thousands and thousands of american citizens have been bamboozled into working for free - no, PAYING - to help the Syrians build a bomb to wipe us out.It's not too late, only you can help us now. Godspeed, engineers."
488,2466,"What a wonderful game. It uses very simple concepts, but requires you to combine them in ever-more sophisticated ways.Well polished, well implemented. Difficulty ramps up nicely, and the UI does its best to stay out of your way (with the notable exception of output labels which need to be hidden manually via a checkbox)It's worth noting that progressing is not just about additional complexity (althought that's present too). It's about finding an elegant optimisation that will help you out of a tight corner.If you love creative, complex problem solving, I think you'll enjoy this game."
489,2466,"The learning curve is so steep it's vertical.  That being said it is an excellent concept and a challenge I recommend.  You think it's tough, and the game just keeps adding elements (of the functional variety as well as the chemical variety)."
490,2466,Highly addictive and difficult puzzle game.Could use a window scaling mode.
491,2466,"This game is incredibly difficult. The learning curve is steeper than perhaps any game I've ever seen, and you're expected to pay close attention whenever the game teaches you something new. Oftentimes just looking up the solution for a puzzle online won't be enough to help because it requires a thorough understanding of how things work in order to progress. However, once you get the hang of the mechanics and are into the rhythm of the puzzles, it is one of the most rewarding puzzle games I have ever played. The complexity of the game means that there are millions of creative solutions for a single puzzle, and I've even gone back to previous puzzles to improve on an old design after learning a new trick or two. The room for improvement is almost infinite; I could see playing for hundreds of hours and still getting better.So if you're a puzzle aficionado willing to get past the first two hours of struggling to understand what the hell is going on, it's easy to lose yourself in this game for hours at a time. An instant favorite in my puzzle game collection!"
492,2466,"There are quite a lot of pipeline/conveyor games out there. SpaceChem is one of the coolest of those. The tutorial is fairly well written (though there are some features that get not explored), graphics and music is lovely. The levels (I'm on plane 3 now) have been both challenging and manageable. Overall very enjoyable. Especially when on discount :)"
493,2466,fails to offer even the simplest resolution adjustment.
494,2463,"I played Infinifactory before this game so this kinda became a 2D Infinifactory. Overall it is great fun, really relaxing while at the same time very challenging. Only thing I could think of is a better balance from start to end of the puzzle. Some of the early puzzles are quite challenging while some of the later ones are sometimes a bit to easy."
495,2463,"Every new level has me cursing in surprise at the steep challange curve. Example.""What the ?""""Aww  me.""""How in the  ?""""Ok this one's easy...wait.......""It's the dark souls of puzzle games."
496,2462,My brain just expanded playing this game
497,2461,"Just because I have seen few reviews mentioning this, I wanted to say that the soundtrack and story of the game are both excellent. The puzzles challenge me, and the music, as well as the anticipation of reading the next piece of the narrative, are what challenge me to not give up. For those interested, the story is available on the internet at http://www.zachtronics.com/spacechem-story/ for individuals who didn't complete the game but who'd still like to know the ending; the soundtrack was, at least at one time, available for free as well online.Thank you to Zach Barth, Evan Le Ny, and Hillary Field."
498,2461,"Educational, deep and complex. Nice difficulty curve."
499,2459,"Overall a great and original puzzle game. It's tagged ""programming"", and for good reason -- even though it doesn't appear to be a programming game on the surface, it will probably be much more natural to people with a programming background.That said, I have found it much more enjoyable than TIS-100, which it is quite similar to in terms of the puzzle construction. That said, SpaceChem is much richer in terms of gameplay, aesthetics, and plot. The story, presented in text chapters as you progress through the game, is also a nice touch.If you're looking for a challenging logic-based puzzle game, this one is for you!"

502,2459,"Great puzzle game. Best thing is, whilst the difficulty curve is steep, I managed to complete higher levels after coming back after a reasonable amount of time."
503,2458,"If you like chemistry, puzzles, and questioning your own intelligence, then this is the game for you!"
504,2458,"Awesome game that will give you a headache from thinking so hard, trying to solve the puzzles.I recommend this game to everyone who likes puzzle games and wouldn't mind a good challenge."
505,2458,"SpaceChem is an absolute masterpiece for any type of gamer, casual or competitive, knowledge about chemistry/programming or no knowledge at all. It is unlike any puzzle game I had ever played, and luckily I was able to purchase it on sale (but it is well worth ten dollars!!). The premise is surprisingly simple and quickly learned, but the developers force you to learn the subtle complexities behind each action/choice you make during the process of solving a puzzle; this is what makes the game so masterful.You CAN figure the puzzles out, but it will require the casual gamer to think in ways s/he has never before.Challenge yourself, don't give up, AND THIS GAME WILL MAKE YOU SMARTER WHILE ALSO MAKING YOU FEEL PRODUCTIVE.Experiences such as taking breaks from a puzzle and yet pondering/dreaming about possible solutions are inevitable for one with an inquiring mind. One of the greatest lessons that one can learn from this game is the process of breaking a single objective into multiple steps and then treating each of those steps as a process/objective of its own. Once a solution is achieved, YOU WILL FEEL WELL REWARDED. *Note: This is a long, replayable game with a catchy soundtrack. I have not finished the game but the story is an interesting addition to the gameplay and is worth following. Even just a slight understanding of chemistry/programming helps, but is not required. I am a chemist, so, personally, the chemistry aspect behind Spacechem was enough to entice me. The game can be likened to performing a chemical experiment in the sense that a puzzle can be visualized in the following way:                                       Reactants ---> Intermediate(s) ---> ProductsBut, of course, the processes are not realistic chemical reactions (or rather the intermediates are not realistic)."

509,2455,"Best puzzle game ever, bosses are insane! 10/10"
510,2454,"I did it.I beat this game.It only took me 6 years.Look at my time spent. That's how thorough this game forces you to be for just the campaign.The game is based around very basic programming and chemical principles, and involves you taking chemicals as inputs and transforming them into desired outputs. More difficult puzzles involve you using multiple sequences like this in tandem to power different devices to defeat some kind of boss.It may start out simple, but by the end it gets obscenely complexThe level of catharsis is proportional to the elegance of your solution, but even a brute-forced, less elegant approach will still warrant a satisfying sigh of relief for a job well done.All in all a great and very challenging puzzle game. While it may help a bit, you don't need a high level of mastery over chemistry to understand the game--that said it'll help teach you some basic principles. Buy if you're looking for a challenge."
511,2454,"GoQ, Puzzle-solving masterpiece.Motivation for you to challenge Spacechem is that statistics claim that only 2  4 % of players had this game finished. And that you can't stumble upon more complex yet simple & uncompromising game. Even slightest mistake can render your entire system unfunctional and in need of rebuild, you can also create such a ""solution"" (using loops) that would take billions of years to complete). Later you can return to refactor your solutions and compare your solution to solutions of others in terms of effectiveness. While going to sleep with unfinished level I was experiencing something like lucid dreaming about possible solutions. It's sure that this game will not be appreciated by some players."
512,2454,"A brilliant and addictive puzzle game that can at times be very challenging. After all the planning and trial & error, it's extremely satisfying to see your machine in action. Highly recommended."
513,2454,"Fun concept for a game. I found it eventually too challenging to finish. I'd recommend to those that like math, chemistry, and logic puzzles. Eventually it became exceptionally hard to figure the problem--or solution--out."
514,2453,"I really liked this game, but theres enough frustrating elements that could be fixed but never were, which is sad for a top selling game.  This is the ultimate puzzle game thats rather unique. If you like challenging games that require a lot of forethought and trial and error this game is a must but for everone else this is a pass. The UI and support can be frustrating, clunky UI and controls take the player out of the game as you fight the UI to get the puzzle done.  No cloud saving means rebeating complicated puzzles every time you re-install.  There is access to user created content but the replay value is somewhat limited once you master the game.After 7 years I beat the game!  I got stuck on one of the middle puzzles and quit.  The game is linear so If you get stuck on a puzzle    While I enjoyed this game and sunk at least 100 hours into it, it is definetly not for most people, but I would say pick it up when its 50% off (for $4.98)   Even after completing it, I was left wanting more, I feel that a few more mechanics in this game (even more than the one in the DLC) and I would of valued this game at $20 like they want for opus magnum which I don't think is worth that price."
515,2453,"Great ""programming"" game."
516,2453,Really challenging and awesome puzzle game!
517,2452,"SpaceChem is an extremely difficult puzzle game that has players think like programmers in designing ""reactors"" that turn chemicals into others on an atomic scale. Two ""waldos"" move along tracks you design and execute commands on those tracks. There are several different commands and new mechanics that are implemented as you play.There are three game ""modes"" in the main story: ""Research"", where you work within one reactor; ""Production"", where you use multiple reactors; and ""Defense"", essentially ""Production"", but with added commands and boss fights. Throughout the main game, the player is told a story of a protagonist who joins SpaceChem, a company that produces chemicals, as they learn of its dark secrets.The game is simple at first, even up to the third world, but then one hits this game's learning cliff. Where it seems the puzzles can't possibly get more difficult, they do. Exponentially. It took me over a year to beat this game (though I played on and off times), and that was just the main story. SpaceChem has loads of user-created puzzles (I believe over 100) that further test your knowledge of the game. Your solve times are also ranked against other players on histograms. SpaceChem also has a full and powerful level editor and ways to upload your own puzzles. The community is great too, although it has been less active.There's just so much to do in this game - you'll find yourself spending hours just solving or optimising single puzzles. Nothing beats the euphoria you'll get from finally beating a puzzle you've been stuck on.Overall, SpaceChem is worth the full asking price as an excellent design-oriented puzzle game. It even has large discounts on it and its DLC very often, and trading cards to go with it. If you're a programmer or enjoy programming, or you just want to get into Zachtronics games, SpaceChem is definitely the way to go."
518,2452,Fun puzzle game with good mechanics and a decent story
519,2452,"Spacechem is a puzzle game. Unlike many such games, these puzzles have countless solutions. Your job is to build one.The puzzles involve geometry and threaded programming. The difficulty ramps up quickly, but there's plenty of opportunity to learn by refining solutions to earlier puzzles. Rather than lines of code, the two ""waldos"" follow symbolic instructions placed along their track.Pilarbox aside, the game has aged well on Windows. Not so well on Mac and iOS. If you're playing on a Mac, you'll need to download an additional tool to fix your installation. (Why the developer can't distribute that fix through Steam remains unclear.)If you've ever written multithreaded code (and enjoyed it), you'll love this game. One of the most important instructions is ""sync,"" which works just like a cyclic barrier. Both waldos must reach a ""sync"" instruction before either can continue past one. Spacechem was the first puzzle game to exercise this part of my brain. The games that have followed all lack a simple synchronization primitive like ""sync."""
520,2452,"After the first few levels the difficulty curve becomes more like a cliff. The puzzles get hard as balls and frustrating, but if that's your cup of tea then you might like this. If not, don't bother."

522,2451,"Interesting puzzles in rapidly increasing difficulty. As we are given the statistics of other players, you can try to find solutions with several goals in mind:- minimize the length of the simulation- minimize the number of instructions- minimize the number of reactorsThe only puzzles which I personally don't enjoy as much are the ones requiring user interaction during the simulation."

Start with loose carbon and hydrogen atoms and figure out how to produce acetylene. It's not just ""stick these here, stick those there, bond 'em and let 'em loose"" because you need to figure out pathing and process, order of operations, and process management. SC calls upon quite a few skill sets, yet somehow never feels like work; it's surprisingly entertaining. The scary thing is that you're actually going to learn. Maybe not chemistry, as such, but programming, order of operations, process management, logistics... give it a chance, and you might find yourself sharpening skills you never knew you had. I'm not saying this is equivalent to an MIT doctorate in chemistry, but it is a sweet fusion (NO PUN) of entertaining and skill-building. The only thing I'm disappointed in is how long I took to buy this."
548,2447,One of the best and hardest puzzle games to date.
549,2447,One of the best puzzle games i have played in a long time.
550,2447,One of the best logic games ever
551,2447,"-you make procedures to assemble molucules, very much like programming-little beyond the theme is chemistry, requires no prior knowlege of chemistry-very complicated-somewhat of a steep learning/difficulty curve for me, not for the casual gamer!-complicated, convuluted puzzles-as others have said, can sometimes feel like work rather then a game-very unique concept, however, if you go to a flash game website (kongregate.com), you will find many puzzle games. none will be quite as deep as this, though-i would reccomend ONLY if you like a extreme challenge"
552,2447,Great puzzles!
553,2447,This was my first Zachtronics game. I loved it to a fault. Finished it. Wished for more. Discovered other Zachtronics games. Now I can't stop.
554,2447,"SpaceChem is a puzzle game that has a lot similarities to programming. You are tasked with ""performing"" chemical reactions and you do this by creating looping set of commands out of given symbols within the reactor. The challenge lies not only within figuring out which commands use and in what order, but also in 2D planning. Space in the reactor is limited and you have to make sure, that the atoms won't collide with reactor walls or other atoms.If there's one aspect of programming, that SpaceChem got really well, it's the fact that there are many solutions to one problem. When solving puzzle for the first time, you can go with ""whatever works"" solution, but ater, when you have more experience, you may reiterate through levels and try to optimize them by the number of used symbols or elapsed cycles. Game slightly provokes you to do that by showing global stats for each level and comparing it with your own.Overall it's a very engaging game if you're into that sort of things. I wouldn't recommend it for people looking for more casual puzzle game, but otherwise SpaceChem is really enjoyable experience."
555,2447,It's a very good puzzle-game if you like challenge... really hard challenge...
556,2447,Highly recommend this game for those who wants to test their mind in patience.
557,2447,Best puzzle game ever.
558,2447,This game is in my eyes the best puzzle game I have played.The game starts off easy and it is getting more challenging.
559,2447,"One of the best puzzle games around. Each puzzle requires a great ammount of thought, with latter stages getting harder. If you do not have a long attention span, this is not the game for you. Otherwise, I would wholey recommend purchasing this game."
560,2447,"Starts off easy... then it melts your brain.  Frustrating initially, but rewarding when you figure it out."
561,2447,This is a very fun and challenigng game. It is always fun to look at the stats and see if you can improve on your solution!
562,2447,breaks your brain... in a good way.
563,2447,"Zachtronics is love, Zachtronics is life. As with all of his other games, you'll be frustrated for hours on end. When you do finally solve the puzzle though, it is such a satisfying feeling."
564,2447,A great game despite the concept.It eases you in gently and before you know it you are essentially learning how to code while hours just vanish... and you might just learn some chemistry while you're at it.
565,2447,"I still go back to play a level or two every now and then, it's a really good game that lets you design a solution rather than trying to figure out the developer's intent for a specific puzzle.Worth the money, and for the DLC too."
566,2446,"A very challenging, interesting, and at all, awesome game!"
567,2446,"This is probably the best pure puzzle game. A lot of games force you to look for the pre-made, already set in stone solution to the problem that it gives you. This game gives you a tool box, an input and an output and says go. Their is a steep learning curve, but its surmountable. Just know that its ok not to be able to finish this game."
568,2446,I've been playing this game off and on for the past month. Solving a tough puzzle in this game is one of the most satisfying things ever. It also teaches some basic programming concepts if that's a thing you care about.
569,2446,(10/10)
570,2446,"This game makes me feel smart. Then stupid. Then very smart. Then truly stupid. Then like a brilliant genius. Then like a complete moron.You get the picture. The boss fights keep getting used to, but are a fun diversion nevertheless. The puzzles are simply brilliant."
571,2446,"Takes you through the basics and then ramps up the difficulty. New concepts are added right until the end of the game.Tweak your nearly working system until it passes and then be amazed at how complicated it ended up being.Perfectionists should be aware that you will not be able to stop playing as you optimize for minimal speed, maximum prettiness."
572,2446,I think I have a new favorite puzzle game. This is delightful.
573,2446,Best puzzle game of all time.
574,2446,"I like very much this game. Interesting story and, of course, puzzles. In the beginning, solutions seem to be quite simple but after the middle of the game I have spent hours to find a solution for some puzzles and still haven't finished the game.But it is always a pleasure to find a solution.Thanks!"
575,2446,"I enjoy SpaceChem very much, but it should be known that this game gets very difficult after only a couple hours."
576,2446,"I didn't believe them when they said it was super difficult. Believe it, friends. Believe it."
577,2446,Stimulating! This might very well be my all-time favourite puzzler.
578,2444,Awesome puzzle game with a very simple concept but puzzles that can bevery complex (especially if you want to optimize your algorithm).
579,2443,Original and great
580,2443,"If you're looking for a challenge, this is the perfect game to make you regret."
581,2443,"Everyone was saying the game was too hard and -being a rather intelligent and very bighead person- I was like 'lol how hard it can be kek'I am rekt. The game is harder than I COULD imagine. If you think you're a hardcore puzzle player, this is your thing.10/10"
582,2440,"This is an amazing game for anybody interested in automation and puzzles. It's very challenging, and encourages creative solutions. I've played 5.4 hours as of this review, and have completed only a fraction of what the game has to offer. I've completed 1/4th-1/3rd of the levels by number, or so, but I've heard that after what I've completed it gets much more difficult, so in terms of time I'm probably only about 1/10th done with the game.Downsides of the game:* Non-customizeable contrtols* fixed window size/resolution. It will only take up a fraction of most monitors. You can go into fullscreen mode, but it just upscales and looks bad* meh story"
583,2440,If you are a puzzle Theme fan this game will keep your brain from getting dumb.
584,2440,One of the best puzzle games I've played to date!
585,2439,"The only thing I can add that hasn't been said in other positive reviews is that SpaceChem has a very subtle element of true RPG.You may not be clicking around to move a character per se, but you DO get in the role of a character... An amazing engineer on foreign planets who can  create tactical missiles out of water pumpsYou may even dream about it."
586,2436,I have no  clue what I'm doing but I have enough of a clue to know this game is good stuff
587,2436,"Here's the thing with this game. It's pretty confusing, obscure, and difficult. But man is it rewarding once you start to figure it out. And that's not a negative. The confusing, obscure, and difficult add very much to the game. It shows you the basics in the beginning, but throws you into the fire real quick. I love puzzles and have been playing games similar to this for the past 25 years, so when I first got into this game I didn't like it. I went back to it again but still didn't. I was cleaning out my steam library and decided to give it another go and actually try to make some progress and it clicked. By far one of the best and unique puzzle games I've played. 10/10 Would find another hidden gem of a game in my library."
588,2436,"I think SpaceChem is great. If you like something that gets you thinking, this is the game for you."
589,2435,"SpaceChem is a very unique puzzle game that somehow managed to draw me in despite my normal lack of appreciation for puzzle games. If you're a fan of logic or programming at all, or if you just like putting together machines and watching them work, then this is a game for you. It's surprisingly intuitive, and despite how easy it is to get into it really manages to ramp up the difficulty in a way that ends up being satisfying rather than frustrating."
590,2435,A very nice puzzle game to keep you thinking even after you stop playing.Difficulty scales up quite nicely if you're up to the challenge and have the patience.
591,2434,Don't know what to do - 10/10
592,2433,Very fun puzzle game. Real problem-solving and I feel like I'm learning new ways to think when I play it.
593,2432,"This game is like an on/off relationship.I finished it though and I feel as though my IQ must have doubled in the process, that is: It isn't easy and it's difficutly is most certainly beyond ""average hard"".The spatial restrictions and limitation of other resources force you to actually think and come up with concise solutions.I found the interactive boss fights really refreshing and fun, especially the final level.I recommend, to those who are patient and seek a (serious) challenge.To beat this game you may have to think a day about and sleep a night over a problem once in a while.You may have to take a week long break to forget about a level and give it a fresh try once in a while.10/10 would browse the forums after beating the game all by myself and not using youtube to read about people complaining how difficult and frustrating this game is and how they didn't manage to finish it without looking up every other level on youtube just to boost my ego again."
594,2431,"Ho boy.SpaceChem is one of those puzzle games that are beyond difficult. You really have to put your gray cells to the test here. I only completed it as fast as I did because I consulted guides on how to solve the different assignments, else it would have gotten rather tough early on already.The main objective in SpaceChem is lining up two production circles, one red, one blue, to grab whatever is put into the reactor, to then output something different, be it a broken down product, something fused together, or something simply taken apart and put back together. The way SpaceChem wraps it into a Lovecraftian space adventure provides an interesting story, if sometimes a bit predictable. But nevertheless, it is a game that has replay value, because there is no fixed way of solving the problem presented. There are fast ways, there are efficient ways, there are fast efficient ways, and then you can do it as complicated as you like - SpaceChem provides a variety of solutions even for the simpler puzzles.And when I say simpler, I mean puzzles involving a molecule consisting of two, maybe three kinds of atoms, and the product requiring the same atoms in different configuration. Later on, when more options are available, your synapses will be frying from trying to figure out how the Hell to tackle the problem at hand."
595,2430,"potentially the most difficult game on steam, best headache i've ever had!"
596,2430,"I think the beauty of this game is that there is never any ""one solution"" like a lot of puzzle games end up falling onto. You're free to create whatever solution you can think of to solve each puzzle... within the confines of a rather restricted space. And it may not look too restricted at first but in the later worlds, whoo, does space management become a big aspect. I understand the need for it though, having no space restraint would make a lot of puzzles really simple in comparison to what they are now, though.The difficulty curve of the game is pretty dang smooth, ranging from simple in world 1 to ""literally hours for every single puzzle"" in worlds 6 through 9. But no challenge ever feels insurmountable when you face it, just intimidating. It's very clearly a programming-styled puzzle game, and it hits all the right nerves with that; designing the best functions to keep the overall design running smoothly, optimizing ever so slightly to hit a time quota, finding new and more efficient ways to solve a problem that subsequently frees up reactor space you desperately needed. I'm one to dive right in to the puzzles and keep tweaking away at them until I hit upon something that functions the way I need to, and then stubbornly stick to whatever functions unless I can't possibly work around it, and, generally, the game doesn't stop me from using this philosophy successfully. There's probably something to be said for planning out something elegant in advance, too, and I bet there are some really cool puzzle designs made that way. It's a game that feels very free, even in its restrictiveness.The game's visuals are basic but effective, they get the job done. The music is... I honestly have no clue, there's too little of it for how long the game runs on and I had to turn it off and put on my own music after a while. The story is passable, but with how long I went between each time I played this game I found it hard to keep track of.That is one thing... this game is incredibly exhausting to play. I'll hammer away at the solution for one puzzle for a few hours and then when I've solved it I'm completely drained and end up not coming back to the game for weeks or even months. Before today the last time I played this game was at the start of June, for instance, and I've been picking away at the levels since... around last october, I believe, at least during this attempt at getting through the game, which for the record was like my third time overall, I think. So yeah.I can definitely see this game not being for everyone but it's certainly a good experience if you're programmatically-minded, though definitely a challenging one, easily one of the hardest puzzle games I've ever played, but I wouldn't have it any other way."
597,2428,"First things first  if you like puzzle games you need to play this game.  Need.Now Im not sure I am qualified to ever finish this game.  I could cheat, sure, but wheres the fun in that? According to steam only 3.7% of players have the game completed cheev  but that is a cheevo very hard earned.One of my fav things about this game is the replay value, which is super rare among puzzles.  For each level there are charts to show how you ranked vs the rest of the internet over 3 separate criteria.  Even when winning you sometimes know you can win better.My only complaint would be a lack of deep tutorials.  Theres a steam page out there with Things I wish I knew while playing SpaceChem that I honestly cant consider cheating but I wish the game had taught me these things instead of asking the internet for tips & tricks.Who should play:  People get a boner at the thought of a multi-layer logic puzzleWho should not play:  Everyone else, particularly people with little patience"
598,2428,"This is one of the best puzzlers I have ever played. It is consistantly challenging, which is a big plus, but also my only con - I had to resort to hints from a guide to progress after 4 hours spent on one level. It has a decent story and a wide variety of level types so it doesn't get boring. It uses some aspects of real chemistry, which is fun for a true nerd.It has some replayability as there are countless ways to solve each puzzle and there are stats at the end of each level that could be improved upon for an added challenge.There are many plusses to this game, but specifically I enjoy the lack of a timer. It's about solving the puzzle, not being rushed. Timing this game would have ruined it for me. It's very well designed, and will take dozens of hours to master and beat. I am on the 5th planet of 9 and 10 hours in at the time of writing. it easily meets my $1 per hour of game play rule.10/10 would get electrocuted by a gian pyramid again."
599,2427,The game suddenly CRASHED on me!WTH?!
600,2427,"A few points for context. I have a Chemical Engineering training background. I do lots of programming in my job. And I really love puzzle oriented games. In other words, this game should be a perfect fit for me.For the most part, this game is amazing. They took a very simple premise, and made a puzzle game that can get really complex. Additionally, since it is possible to design your own puzzles, I can easily understand the existence of online contests around this game.Unfortunately, I think that it is my programming background that shows the flaws in the developement environment. The help screens (and tooltips) are a bit lacking in detail. The cut-n-paste mechanics are a bit too weak. The ability to save components for reuse are also not useful enough. I understand that this is just a game, and not an IDE, but it is a programming game... or perhaps, I am just being too critical.   In summary, I do recommend this game, but it is not perfect."
601,2427,"Extremely interesting puzzle game! This is a well-reviewed and well-played game already, but sadly, many puzzle games that are awesome go by unnoticed because of how rare a delightful, elegant puzzle game comes around. Here is a list in descending order of why you ought to buy this game:1. Chemistry2. Logic3. Science4. Simplicity and increasing complexity5. Feeling like you might have been Doogie Howzer6. Breaking bad, except, there's nothing bad about it!"
602,2426,Worth more than it costs.The best puzzle game ever.
603,2426,"Awesome. Will have you brain scratching, but all the puzzles are logical and can be solved eventually! A very original and challenging puzzle game, which uses mechanical engines to dissasemble and assemble molecules. The feeling of getting a solution to one of the later puzzles is similar to that of solving some particularly complex climate physics. Reccomended!"
604,2426,Fantastic game - its really challenging.There is only one thing i have to complain about: the german translation. But its only relevant if you want to read the story-tale; its not reducing the game-fun in any way.
605,2426,"Prepare yourself for a headache.Edit: If I wasn't clear enough, I actually do suggest this title to anyone who likes challenging puzzles."
606,2426,You do not need to know chemistry to play this game. Knowing chemistry will not help you with this game. It will take you a lot of time to get through the huge amount of puzzles available.
607,2425,I'm an hour into this game and I'm already obssessed with it. It's like my powerplant engineering class without the anxiety.
608,2425,
609,2425,"Possible reasons that'd stop you from exploring/enjoying this gameAlso my own journey. First 5 levels""A bit too simple, is this really fun?""""Just Grade 7 chemistry. Real-life reactions don't work that way. It's more tedious than difficult and I don't see how it's educational.""but the well-written story kept me going :)Around level 8 or so""Woah the difficulty rise is a bit steep. I can't figure it out. I feel dumb & not exactly motivated to solve""  On hindsight that level isn't particularly hard, but this game is minimalistic, which means(1) more possibilities (good)(2) no clues (good and bad)You can think independently, explore freely and feel happier when you discover a certain idiom of symbol arrangement on your own.Buuuut, it might bore you before you ""get"" this game. When I just started, some basic techniques totally eluded me, like multiple entries within 1 run, or overlapping pipelines. I didn't cheat; it took me a damned long time to figure that out. Outside-the-box thinking requires serious wrestling.Once I got to the 3rd & 4th planet, it was pretty fun.It was challenging and getting addictive. When I beat a level but my solution wasn't the neatest, I'd even replay the level.There was also more variations in gameplay.The mid and later portions are really difficult and tedious.I haven't finished. I'll see if it will lose me anywhere, or if it'd be both brain-wracking and fulfilling fun at the same time."
610,2424,Very good puzzle game or rather problem solving game. Warning: some of the later puzzles can take multiple hours to complete. It does feel incredibly rewarding though. I recommend it to those that want to unleash the engineer inside them.
611,2424,"Fake chemistry has never been more fun!  This puzzle game is quite ingenious and although it can be frustrating at times, you feel very satisfied when you solve each level."

Net->Buys Whiteboard->Watches Flidais Explode->Buys Whiteboard->Watches the Prometheus Explode->Buys Whiteboard->Beats Game->Stares Nervously at Pile of Dirty Whiteboards10/10 Would Go Buy Another Whiteboard Again.
613,2423,This game just makes me feel dumb.  It starts out fun but then it ramps up quickly to the point I gave up.  I checked on youtube for solutions and they are all there but after using a couple I wondered wtf is the point if I couldn't figure them out lol and quit playing.  Requires mental capacity I do not possess... that makes me a sad panada...
614,2423,"I wish I could vote neutral, but I really can't thumbs up on this. Main reason: it's too clever for me. I get what it's trying to do and applaud the originality of it, but the execution brings it to a halt to me.Your task is to build certain molecules. Probably awesome if you're a chemist, but it beats others over the head with details. The actual game is layed out in a very, VERY minimal (even abstract) way, and because everything has to fit on a single screen, you either ""see"" it or you're messing around. Spacechem certainly isn't the only puzzle game that can get frustrating, but to me, this is one where solving puzzles didn't wow me. Perhaps because the field is so small most of my approaches failed to start (meaning: you better have an elegant solution RIGHT AWAY because otherwise you can't tweak what you build).At first I thought this kind of game just wasn't for me...but after playing infinifactory (which is more or less this game in 3D - by the same makers), I now think it's because this game is just too minimalistic and has a too narrow playing field."
615,2422,Too steep of a learning curve. It's not fun to still be confused half a dozen levels in.
616,2422,Really cool puzzle game with a ton of depth.
617,2421,The late game is difficult but rewarding.
618,2421,"Very good puzzles, requiring spacial and logical thinking (knowing chemistry does not actually help).Special mention: The intermittent ""boss fights"" are an awesome addition.Note that this game is quite a bit harder than most puzzle games, so it is not for everyone."
619,2421,"It will test your brain and the solutions you discover give you the needed rush most puzzle games don't offer. It's exceptionally satisfying to see something you pour possibly hours over working as you made it. If you're actually expecting real chemistry though, look elsewhere. This is ""SpaceChem""."
620,2420,Space chemi is a great game it starts off relatively simple however as the game progreses the puzzles increase in complixity and at the end you will be scratching your head to find a solution to the insane problems that face you.However the satisfaction you feel at solving what semed unsolvable is immense.
621,2419,"Puzzle game for programmers (and others). This game is so hard! I really like it, but the difficulty level can be daunting.I would recommend it if you like solving logic puzzles and if you don't mind spending a long time to get a puzzle right. You'll probably enjoy it even more if you *after* solving a puzzle then also enjoy optimizing that solution."
622,2419,"After each puzzle you feel like a pro but then you realize you're not even halfway through the game and haven't even unlocked all the symbols to work with yet...Sometimes my score is by far the worst out of all players and I wonder how I did it at all, but I did it. And it's just so damn satisfying."
623,2419,All Zachtronics games are logical beauty in video game form
624,2419,"My brain hurts now.This is a great game with great design and very hard puzzles that you will love to replay and improve upon.Lastly if you ever wannted to feel like a space chemistry engineer programmer, get this game!"
625,2419,Bad
626,2418,I think this might be one of my favorite puzzle games of all time
627,2418,A very good and very hard puzzle game.
628,2416,The best puzzle game I've played since Hexcells.
629,2416,Awesome9.3/10But a pain in the ass to beat
630,2415,It's alright if ur in to puzzles I guess but its no Infinifactory...
631,2415,"Whenever I beat a puzzle, it feels like an orgasm.That's rare compared to cold, hard defeat."
632,2415,IF you can get your head round it.DO.
633,2414,"This game is incredibly hard, but completely fair. Essentially it is an IQ test in puzzle form. Really the only thing I dislike about the game is the part where you connect reactors to each other. It's a good concept but feels clunky, and violative of the spirit of the game. I don't want to arrange reactors and pipes in a grid with artificial obstacles in the way. And if I screw up the placement it takes a lot of work to redo. Having said that, it's really not as bad as I'm making it out to be. If you like logic puzzles, you will love this game."
634,2414,"Soooo addictive, solve, optimize, optimize, and optimize some more"
635,2413,"This game is a marvel. Zachtronics Industries proved that their sandbox games deserve a bigger scope. Spacechem offers dozens of puzzles in a story-driven campaign, where you need to design and optimize atomic assembly lines. Usually, you just need to produce given compounds, but the real fun begins when you need to manage the reactions in real time to defend yourself against exotic space monsters.For serious players, the game offers achievements, an optimization race in leaderboard statistics, and hundreds of player-created puzzles in the Journal of Reaction Engineering.While the main game environment looks very technical, you will become absorbed in building, optimizing and debugging your reactions to achieve results that initially seemed impossible. The austere environment of reactor grids is accompanied by beautiful hand-drawn visuals of various planets and cosmic monsters. The music is original, fitting, I would even say motivational, yet another high-quality element of the whole impressive piece.So, if you are actually reading this review, I cannot recommend Spacechem enough. Go buy it and make some chems!"
636,2413,"Factorio, but on a micro level. And I mean MICRO."
637,2412,Oh the joy of finding a puzzle game that manages to be extremely challenging without being extremely dull. The only reason I haven't spent more time on this game is that it makes my head hurt after an hour or so
638,2411,Game - done.Brain - broken.
639,2411,It's too hard :(   i choose death
640,2411,"Best puzzle game ever.If you love logic, you're gonna love it."
641,2410,"A near perfect puzzle game, probably best one I know of."
642,2410,"SpaceChem is more than a puzzle game, it's like something so well designed that could be considered a classic.When I started this game I was full of doubts thinking that it was difficult to me to understand how to play...Instead the game unlocked step by step and every time the gameplay , fantastc, revealed itself.And belive me that when you will see your first circuit working will be good, but when you will design an entire industry...I suggest this game to puzzle lovers, an for programmers and IT this software is Mandatory!Until you find Ts-... :)Lord Hol Napult's experience of game: 9/10"
643,2410,Best puzzle game ever. Starts easy buts gets complex.
644,2410,"Step 1: Spend half an hour drawing a diagram on paper of what each reactor roughly should do.Step 2: Spend another hour trying to make those reactors actually do the thing.Step 3: Test your design as a whole.Step 4: Watch as one reactor isn't efficient enough, causing a transport pipe to clog and screw up everything.Step 5: Realize that your entire design is thwarted by one minor flaw you can't seem to fix.Step 6: Get a headache trying to figure out an alternative solution.Step 7: Suddenly think of a much simpler solution that you should have thought of the first time.Step 8: Watch as it works perfectly.Step 9: Look at the leaderboards and see the enormous amount of people who made a simpler, more efficient design.10/10 would slash my wrists open with Occam's Razor again."
645,2410,This game is so insanely hard you should get an honorary PhD for beating more than the first few levels without your brain exploding.
646,2409,Super fun game.  I've spent hours trying to optimize each level more than my friends.
647,2409,"I tried to recommend this game to my friends,and now nobody plays whatever I recommend anymore."
648,2409,The best puzzle game I've ever played.
649,2408,Trully great game !
650,2408,"This one was too smart for me, if I recall correctly."
651,2406,"Fantastic puzzle game, although very difficult to finish. It's actually a great introduction to programming - procedures, conditions, loops, subroutines, it's all there, easy to understand.Highly recommended."
652,2406,"SpaceChem is a truly great game. The rules and mechanics are easy to understand, and the challenge comes from ""making the code work"", so to say. I do recommend wholeheartedly to anyone who likes puzzles, who likes to sit down and THINK HARD about a problem. When I get stuck on a problem, the next day I catch myself passively thinking about a way to resolve it on the bus or at work. And when you manage to actually do it? Oh boy, other kinds of video-game satisfaction cannot hold a candle to it!No need to buy right away, try the demo first. I did. It was love at first sight. 30 hours later, still much of the game remains. And once that is done, there are challenges made by the community."
653,2406,"It's a really hard game that makes you think a lot. In levels that require reactors, you have to plan ahead on what reactor will do what if you don't want to have 1h of work go to garbage because you need 1 more reactor to complete the mission and you've already reached the limit.Once you pass a level of difficulty, this game just keeps delivering harder and harder content. If you reach the point where it doesn't, you can still try to optimize every level you've played to use less symbols/reactors or to have the solution solved in less cyclesIt also has ResearchNet! Wich has a lot of really hard and extremely tricky levelsMusic isn't great, but it actually doesn't get repetitive because your brain is barely paying attention to itDidn't quite like the deffense missionsI definitely recommend this game if you like rewarding puzzles"
654,2406,"One of the coolest puzzle games out there. Once you get multiple reactors you have to start thinking about efficiency, and how to prevent waste and blockages. As you go along you'll have to come up with techniques to get reactions flowing more smoothly. I'm half way through the campaign but I feel like I've barely figured out the strategy behind it."
655,2406,"First off, this game is quite an impressive concept. I bought it on a whim and I have not been disappointed.What you have here is a casually serious game. How's that work? No time limits except for a rare occasion; You can easily stop, reset everything, and try again without repercussion. Make a mistake? Oops! No need for save scumming. Just hit the stop button and try again.(Dusts off highschool chemistry book)... Okay there we go. You may not need this (knocks on book) or be in an episode of Breaking Bad, but understanding how chemistry works is important. You simply cant put an atom here or there, willy-nilly and expect the same product.Timing, Loops, Logic, and Forethought. Being bred into a musical family, the first three I am very capable of. The forethought? Not so much. You have to look at paths, instructions, and syncronization. If you let some parts go without some sort of ""wait for blue/red path to reset"", you can bork the whole thing in a bink of an eye.While this game gets progressively more difficult, it doesnt leave you hanging. Sure there's going to be some face-planting on the desk, but when you realize that the instruction symbols have other options it changes the game. When your puzzle fails, it will show you where you failed. You just have to figure out why. You dont always have to use BOTH red and blue.The soundtrack music may turn many of you off, but I found it inspirational and motivating. There are not many songs, but they have that ""movie"" feel. Hard to tell its all synthesized."
656,2406,"What to say? As far as puzzling games go, this is very, very, very top of the league. What starts out as nearly trivially simple with the first level or two quickly becomes a mind-bender which keeps on busy for ours. The whole is packaged with minimalistic graphics which suite the games just perfect. Any more eye-candy would have been a distraction. The puzzel interface is also well made, with shortcut keys allowing for quick restructuring. What remains is the 'storyline' which  is surely rather minimalistic but still motivating to 'move on' to the next level and see what happens. If you like training your brain with novel ideas, this game is a must-have. Just don't be too hard on yourself if you get stuck over a puzzle for a long time  - finally cracking it is so rewarding! And if you want to get ""full value"" for your money, try beating other people by finding a yet-more-efficient solution.   In short: This game was simply my best purchase over the last year. Oh, but I'm sure there are lots and lots of gamers out there, which will just hate the game..."
657,2406,Great game!Lots of higher level thinking and problem solving involved. My favorite of the Sandbox Puzzle genre.
658,2406,A challenging and satisfying mindbender.
659,2405,8.5/10
660,2405,"If you like solving problems and like to code this is an absolute must have.If you have no experience with such things, but are open for a new experience to challenge yourself and twist your brains, go get it. maybe wait for a sale if you are unsure, i got it for 1$, i almost feel bad now, it's definitely worth the full price.If you only want brainless entertainment for relaxing, this is not for you, nothing to see here.You have to invest some time at the beginning to understand the mechanics and how things are done and i think the tutorials could be more specific about certain things. Nevertheless the concept is great and as it gets gradually more difficult and there are often new things to discover it can keep you busy for quite a long time."
661,2405,"If you enjoy programming, this game is a wonderful way to sink hours (or days) of thinking into something. It's easy enough at first that you can learn the mechanics, and feel confident enough that when you reach the much more challenging levels, you'll try for days to beat them. I'd even spend time in my classes drawing out solutions to levels that came into my head. It's definitely worth your time and money, but only if you're interested in programming (and possibly space/chemistry)."
662,2405,Great
663,2405,Challenging until it got so hard that it felt like work.
664,2405,"What can I say about SpaceChem? I thoroughly enjoyed it, in the way that one enjoys the Sunday Crossword in the NYT, or figuring out how to solve a six-layer Rubix Cube. The game does a good job introducing you to the basic mechanics, but strategy is all up to you. Some experimentation is required to figure out the finer details of how different features work.The first few levels are a walk in the park and the story is actually quite entertaining. Once I got a ways into it, the levels started taking me so long (because by jove they were complex!) that by the time I got another peice of storyline I'd forgotten the last thing that happened.Probably not for everyone - it's a *very* difficult puzzler, but for me this game was two thumbs up."
665,2405,"This game has a really strange difficulty curve, it's almost a difficulty wall, and there is basically no hand-holding. It is not for everyone. However, I like it a lot and spent a lot of time enjoying it. If you actually LIKED doing science homework in high school, or have a soft spot for games that actually require you to break out pen and paper, you might like this game."
666,2405,Programming puzzle games are my favourite type of puzzle games. This game combines logic with spatial reasoning!
667,2404,This isnt even a  game its some kind of computer science homework 
668,2404,"Game is great, but unfortunately, the developer dropped support for it on macOS, so I'm no longer able to play it.Unfortunately, due to the bad support from the developer, I have to give it a thumbs down.If you're on Windows or Linux, you're fine. Just be aware, that the developer will likely drop support at the first sign of trouble.Edit: there is a public fix at https://github.com/leafi/fix-spacechem-os-x, which works flawlessly for me. I will change the review to positive as soon as this fix is integrated in the application."
669,2404,"TL;DR:It's not a bad game, but you should think carefully about whether or not you are the target audience.On paper, SpaceChem sounds exactly like my kind of game. It's a playful take on concurrent programming, and on top of that, it's themed around chemistry.I like puzzle games. I like programming. I like chemistry. Surely I will like SpaceChem then, right?Unfortunately not. I tried really hard to enjoy this game, but each time I play, a very distinctly nagging feeling hit me: I could just be programming. The game isn't bad in any notable way, and I actually had some fun playing it. But I just have so much more fun actually programming.This will be a ""buyers beware"" to the kind of people that get irritable during handhold-y tutorials and on-rails games.SpaceChem is a game. Not a sandbox. This game boils programming down to two concepts: Solving the problem, and optimizing your solution. There is going to be one single ""best"" solution to the problem at hand, and your solution is going to be either optimal or sub-optimal. End of story.Here is why you will probably like this game:If you need someone to tell you what your immediate goal is, if you feel uncomfortable with just being dropped in the deep end with no milestones or objectives, this game is for you! Intimidating as it may seem, this game does a wonderful job at providing the player with a controlled environment, clear goals, instructions and rules.Here is when and why you should think twice about buying this game:This game does its own thing, and it does it well, but it is neither chemistry nor computer science in any way. It is a game with a theme. At most, it is about repeatedly improving on solutions to the same problem. Hence, neither ""because programming"" nor ""because chemistry"" should be your reason for purchasing this title.If you have a fascination with chemistry, have done any programming in the past, or just generally prefer sandbox games, this is not that."
670,2404,"It straddles the line between challenging and frustrating, depending on what day it is. It's one of those games where you actually have to work for the achievements, and it's great value for money (I've got around 80 hrs for the actual time I spent with it and I think I'm about halfway there). Probably made me smarter more than school ever did tbh."
671,2404,awesome game very complex but rewarding stilll rewarding
672,2403,If I had to count how many times I had pulled my in a WTF fasion.It would be the number of how much I love this game.itsreallyhard.
673,2403,Holy.. Yes! Yes! A thousand times yes!
674,2403,"This game has little to do with chemistry. It's an automata programming game.I remembered the first time I see such a game when I was in high school. It's called  Manutactoria . You are literally programming Turing Machines there. And I think SpaceChem is quite similar: the semantics of and the interactions between the elements are simple, but with these simple elements, you can do infinitely complex jobs.It's hard, but not all that hard. I completed all the puzzles in the story line except for the optional ones and the final boss fight in a little more than 20 hours. You do need to focus on the most specific things like the placement of the bounders and routing the two waldos through the array of symbols, and some times these problems are solved with ugly ad-hoc tricks, but you definitely should go beyond that level. Once you discovered how to do a recurring task like moving around a cross-shaped array of bounders to assemble or disassemble a methane molecule or arranging several flip-flops to perform a sequence of commands a desired amount of times, the puzzles starts to get easier. You quickly figure out similar structures in the input and output and decide what should go where. Then you adjust your known structures to solve each step and the job is done.Every time when you see in the statistics that your dashed yellow line is way to the left of the peak of the bar chart, you feel clever.Those at the right end of the chart are not stupid either. Everyone who progressed to the later part of the game must be clever.But some people are just more clever than others. The research net is the difficult part. It is organized into volumes and issues, just like real scientific journals. Amusing. But the puzzles there are seriously difficult. Most of the time you stare at the puzzles and think, ""How is that even possible? The author must be insane!""When you finally solved a difficult problem and see your efficient and elegant (or not so mush so) production pipeline running, see those materials flowing in and products flowing out after some arcane transformation, you start getting fascinated, even though you are the one who built those things. Sometimes I am amazed at how good us humans are at discovering patterns and constructing increasingly complex structures from simpler ones. Maybe that is central to our intelligence."
675,2403,"The incredible depth and learning curve held up until the last few levels got a bit sketchy, your answers to the problems can be honed and optimised for endless replayabilty. However be careful of those strange recurring dreams of Waldos and Bonding Reactors, the efficient preparation of the dinner table each night and the complete dissociation with the outside world when piping reactors."
676,2403,"One of the best puzzle games I've played! Definitely, definitely needs to be played!"
677,2403,This game is actually  difficult and there's more than one solution to every puzzle. Get it for that person in your life who believes they are good at everything. Get it for the person who loves puzzles. Buy it for yourself because I know you want it.
678,2402,"I love this game.  It's very relaxing to me to try and construct the most optimal machine to complete the puzzle.  You have to think sequentially, logically, and innovatively in order to complete the challenges.  Definitely worth $10 and a must-buy if it's on sale and you like puzzle/strategy games."
679,2402,pretty hard
680,2402,"Does the idea of designing tight loops and ensuring proper synchronization for pseudo-chemistry-based processes, as an engineer within the space-chemical-industrial complex, get you out of bed? How about an unhealthy fixation on leaderboards?If the answer to either of the above was a resounding, ""Sweet gentle Jesus, yes!"" -- then play SpaceChem!"
681,2402,It will melt your brain in a beautiful way :)
682,2401,"Works on wine-staging 1.9.1, as long as you drag away that box that says the game has crashed and just leave the window open. (EDIT: It seems to not be saving my progress. Dammit. Oh well, I guess I get to have more practice, then.)I've played a lot of programming puzzle games before. As a general rule, if you're teaching an aspect of computer science, it usually turns out fairly good, and if you're just teaching people how to bash directions into a small space, it usually sucks.And then you've got stuff like SpaceChem, RoboZZle, and Jahooma's LogicBox, which are a bit of both. And they turn out amazing.(There are other categories, although Hack 'n' Slash gets its own special category for pretending to teach you how to hack but you have to go through some cumbersome chores first and you get bored before you finish them. Avoid.)SpaceChem, from a computer science perspective, is a game about multithreading, and avoiding race conditions. Or something like that.From a non-compsci perspective, it's about moving atoms around, binding them together, and hoping you get the right results and also hoping they don't smash into each other.Either way, it's a puzzle game that holds your hand for a few tutorial levels and basically gives you the ""standard"" answer, and then leaves you to it. It has a rather sharp difficulty curve, but even if you're stumped on a later level, you can always go back to an earlier one and look at just how bad the ""standard"" solution you were given on a silver platter was, and improve on it.You can also compute compete against your friends to see who can solve a puzzle in the fewest number of cycles, or use the fewest number of symbols... or the fewest number of reactors for some of the later puzzles that are still early enough to be in the demo version.Did I mention there's a demo version? You should play it, and then if you like it (and I will make you like it) then you can throw your money at Zachtronics and get the full version.In short, SpaceChem is a really good programming puzzle game that teaches you the fun of dealing with race conditions, and there's more than one way to do each puzzle."
683,2401,"nie graem ale kupiem na promocji za 0,99 euro za itemki xd ale i tak polecam"
684,2401,This game will steal your life. It is that addictive.
685,2401,"WARNING: Playing SpaceChem may cause depression, frustration, and suicidal tendencies.Most of the time it's like:1. Spend 2-4 hours designing an elaborate circuit to solve an assignment with just one reactor.2. Success! 1 Reactor, 5400 cycles, 89 symbols!  :D3. Google ""1 Reactor solution for <the problem you just solved>""4. Find a mind-numbingly simple solution: 1 Reactor, 1400 cycles, 43 symbols. :-/5. Turn off the computer and contemplate on the astonishingly pea-like size of your brain.10/10"
686,2401,This game has -good music-story (for a puzzle games like this usually do not)i bought it for like less than 1 dollar on sale. woot woot very great a game 10/10
687,2400,"I noticed this game will drag you through the famous FIVE STAGES OF GRIEF when solving each puzzle:1. Denial: ""Ha! This puzzle does not look so difficult!""2. Anger: ""How am I expected to solve this if I'm not given more <reactors / bonders / space / you name it>""3. Bargaining: ""You know, I will just erase all this crap, and restart from scratch. That should do it.""4. Depression:  catatonic depression settles in. You stare at the void, while cranking solutions in your mind that will never work. You consider giving up the game entirely. 5. Acceptance: all of a sudden, something clicks, and you solve it! Fist pumps and mental extase ensue. You then ACCEPT you are a glutton for punishment and proceed to the next puzzle. Welcome back to to step 1!"
688,2400,"DONT BUY THIS ON MAC!!!Even though the game is amazing and very complex in its simplicity it does not support mac anymore. I was lucky that I had a windows 10 desktop for gaming which runs it without problems buy if you want to play it on MAC OS X dont buy this game. Other than that the game is worth the full price tag but i bought it on sale and it was about 1$ with the dlc. So I was very lucky. But i would also happily pay the full price for it. Wait if you are close to a sale like christmas or summer, buy if you are not"
689,2400,"You don't figure out SpaceChem. You don't ""solve"" the solution. You INVENT the solution. You build the solution in your mind and learn the humbling limitations of this cruel reality which forces you to compromise your solution and keep adding cancerous growths to your beloved idea and weep when everyone elses solutions are so much more beautiful.You'll be walking down the street to run an errand, realize a different approach, rush home and spend five hours fixing the solution, realizing you forgot to finish your errand.You will see a wall and stare at the wall for hours, then become a mason and unbuild the wall, revealing a steel wall behind it. And it's the best feeling you've ever felt ever"
690,2400,"10/10, best puzzle game ever.This, to me, is exactly what Zachtronics Industries is all about. A game, simple in concept, but devilishly difficult in application. I've played it through 2.5 times now, and apparently I've clocked up 130 hours, but that doesn't take into account the hours lost in the shower, in bed, at work, just trying to figure out new and more efficient ways to move/convert/combine atoms to make molecules. I love this game. I've recommended it to everyone. You should buy it. The End"
691,2400,Awesome puzzle game with fun presentation.
692,2400,"This unique game is one of a kind, and for its price I highly recommend it. The challenging aspect of the 'puzzles', is that they require you to think ahead as to how your level design will work whilst it is in operation.As you venture further on in to the game, you'll find yourself stumped at times as the solutions to the levels become more complex. This adds to the sense of satisfaction that you'll recieve upon completing the level.The game has a competitive edge by letting players compete to find the more 'efficient' solution to the level."
693,2400,"It's like pipedream but better.Construct tracks. On each square of the track, you can put a simple instruction.When you are ready the ""Valdo"" will follow the track, executing instructions on the way.If all goes well, it will build a ""molecule"". Each puzzle gives you a set of molecules to construct.There's no ""You must do it that way !"", only the end result matters.If you like watching automatised production lines, you will like that game.I like watching automatised production lines."
694,2400,"As a Chemical Engineering grad this game is a great callback to long hours spent working with process design software on projects. Overall it is a great puzzle game incorporating aspects of chemistry, engineering, and process optimization."
695,2399,People say rocket science is hard.lol.
696,2399,"An amazing easy-to-learn, hard-to-master puzzle game with a perfect difficulty curve and a huge amount of content."
697,2399,[ENG]Warm-up of brains. I recommend. I prevent complexity high![RUS] . .   !
698,2399,"A very stimulating and entertaining programming puzzle game. If you like puzzles that are actually logical, I can't recommend SpaceChem enough. The gameplay consists of putting commands on a line where a ""waldo"" travels. These can grab, drop, rotate, trigger elements to spawn, trigger bonders, and of course change direction. The goal is to take base elements and send them to the outbox as a compound.Paid a dollar and I feel it was worth every penny. 9/10, couple little quirks, but its exceptional at being what it wants to be."
699,2399,"Even wanted to know what it is like to be a programmer? Well, welcome to my line of work!11/10 would optimize solution to beat the scores of my other programming friends."
700,2398,"Probably my favorite puzzle game of all time.  Every puzzle has a thousand correct solutions and a million wrong ones.  It has that great balance where you can build an ugly solution to a complicated problem and feel very proud of it, but still want to improve it."
701,2398,"Amazingly rewarding and addictive puzzle games. I'm the kind of person who normally pretends to like puzzlers but secretly gets frustrated and looks up walkthroughs on really difficult problems. But SpaceChem is so open-ended, so satisfying, that I was never tempted to cheat. Buy this now."
702,2398,Game's too hard.
703,2398,"This game is the perfect puzzle game.It is brutally difficult with extremely challenging puzzles.The basis of the game is that you control a thing called waldos of blue and red colour to achieve an output atom structure based on the input atom structure.There are various puzzle elements like bonders,sensors,flip flops that are introduced to help you in your way with bonders bonding atoms,sesors sensing the atom and allowing you to take alternate paths and flip flops which are the most complicated puzzle element I have ever seen.***K flipflops.It is a highly rewarding fame once you figure the solution.It requires high critical thinking to come to the solution.It has absolutely nothing to do with chemistry with the atoms just forming a premise for the puzzles.I got more than the amount paid for the time I played the game.teh defense missions are one of the weak points and I gave up the game in the last 4 stages at a level called dont fear the reaper.but till that time I got more than my money's worth.the story is intriguing and is interesting and is displayed through text only.Highly recommended if you like to solve puzzles.Highly frustrating but equally highly rewarding."
704,2397,My brain hurts.
705,2397,"This game is wonderful. Chances are if you're this far down in the reviews you have an idea of how this game works. If you don't, basically you use puzzle pieces to program machines that do chemistry. For every puzzle, there is no one solution,  you are limited only by the rules and your creativity as to what will work. You will spend hours trying to figure out one puzzle, but when you figure it out, there are few feelings better than that one of accomplishment the game creates.The game runs absolutely fine, of course, it's really not very demanding, so if you have a lower end PC and need to waste umpteen hours of your life, this can be your game.If you like puzzles, or programming, or chemistry, or running headlong into challenges, difficulty be damned, I recommend this game wholeheartedly."
706,2396,Best buy ever! I bought it in sale for $1 and it's more than worth it. I recommend buying it even if it's not on sale. Don't buy this game for the story. The music is great though.
707,2396,"This game is evil. It's the kind of evil that parents think lurks around every corner at night, when your child is alone.But, imagine this evil also being a guy giving out free candy. (A really nice person!). That's this game.It's so hard you will ragequit and go to bed, but when you finally get that ""Eureka"" moment, and beat the level you've been stuck on for over 3 hours, it feels like you're in heaven!I can only reccomend this game! Get it if you can stand the frustrations it brings."
708,2396,"Only 2 hours in and mostly trial and error for me, but I love this game.  Nice music, a story and very fluid gameplay (graphics). I expect this to become seriously challenging to my FPS brain. As a puzzle game 10/10."
709,2396,"Such a unique puzzle game that it somehow relaxing and stressful at the same time. Those that like the Portal series, suduku, and crosswords would like this game I think. I got it for $0.99 on a steam sale. An absolute steal. It is well worth $10 or more."
710,2396,The concept is quite simple but at the same time has a lot of depth. One of the most interresting puzzle games i have come across to date. It has everything a puzzle game should. The difficulty curves well and it remains fun for a very long time.
711,2395,"I have played less than two hours of this game and can affirm that it is golden. On the surface, it looks like some kind of strange puzzle game that requires you to know a thing or two about chemistry, and while it does actually kind of touch on and teach really basic chemistry topics, it has nothing to do with it otherwise.No disguising the fact that it is a puzzle game, though, and a very logic heavy one at that. Every level tasks you to get a certain output from a set of inputs, and the mental gymnastics you have to perform to get some of those outputs are astonishing. Like most truly good puzzle games, the way you solve it will probably be different from the way the developers thought to solve it, your best friend will think to solve it, your dog will think to solve it; the whole chain of command. At the end of every level, you're given a graph showing the best and worst scores for the puzzle, and you can hit tab to see how you compare to your friends, and eventually see where your friends gave up. The rankings gauge you in three areas - how fast your solution performs, how many reactors your solution uses (efficiency part 1) and how many commands your solution uses (efficiency part 2). I tend to get all of my high scores in fast solutions, and I find myself replaying the same levels over and over to try and create a more efficient, speedy solution. I'm sure the novelty of that will wear off... probably.Certainly the best game I've purchased for a dollar, and it really outshines some that I've payed more for. For the amount of content and replay value in this, I'd say its normal price tag of ten dollars is a fair price. If you're a puzzle game enthusiast, or someone who wants to keep the logical part of their brain in tip top shape, buy it, it's good fun."
712,2395,"you should play this game, because steam told me to do so.also it's nice to watch and-cheaper than call of  duty-some other reason-yet another reason-you get the idea.so, if you want,"
713,2395,"Got this for a dollar in the steam black Friday sale.  It is by far the best 1 dollar I ever spent.  Total Biscuit was doing a whole, ""best games for under a dollar on steam"" video and when I saw this game, having been a chemical engineer major in college, I had to get it.  While it may use fake chemistry, it does in fact feel a little like solving organic chemistry problems mixed with electrical circuits and a bit of programming/logic type puzzling.  The game follows a very specific model, as it slowly introduces you to each new element, you start to get used to them and are challenged with the ever increasing difficulty.  Even for the scientifically minded this game can be quite difficult and rewarding.  Pick it up if logic/puzzling interests you and if it sounds even mildly interesting then you can check out the extensive and content rich tutorial. (not that a dollar or two would break the bank)"
714,2395,"If you liked The Incredible Machine, you'll like this game too. It's quite difficult, but very satisfying. The programmers were kind enough to include a leaderboard, so you can go from marvelling at your brilliance to despairing in the face of others' superior intellect in seconds."
715,2395,Should have been called BrainBreaker.
716,2395,This is a very fun an interesting puzzle game that uses programming techniques to build stuff. Recommended for Computer Science students!
717,2395,Really good game if you like complicated puzzles
718,2395,"What idiot made this! It opens in a window that is too large for the screen, with the options of course being at the bottom, so there is no way to tell it to go full screen!It may well be a good game, but when it is impossible to actually play it, who would know!"
719,2395,When i first seen this game i dont really get the point.After 10-15 minutes i fallen in love <3Defenetly will play more.
720,2394,"SpaceChem is a game that's difficult to talk about without sounding like a major nerd, but I'll try.The game follows the story of the titular galactic chemical industry supercorporation, SpaceChem, through the eyes of a freshman reactor engineer. In itself that would sound like some of the most boring setups ever, but consider that SpaceChem universe is full of hostile giant alien wildlife, paranormal phenomena, and, worst of all, malfunctioning equipment, and it is all up to SpaceChem to deal with that stuff. You know, while synthesizing molecules.In the actual game, you operate special reactors that can manipulate separate atoms into place to synthesize molecules. You also get to build these reactors on the planets' actual surfaces and connect them with pipelines together to synthesize really crazy stuff, such as making water into plutonium. That plutonium is then used in nuclear warheads together with rocket fuel that you have to synthesize, and that warhead is launched in real time at a giant octopus attacking your facility, no questions asked. The game is not exactly easy, but it does a decent job introducing new mechanics exactly once you have mastered the previous one.SpaceChem is a crazy mix of really dumb fake chemistry, really smart solutions, really cool boss fights and a really bizarre-yet-thrilling story. You also get exclusive cosmetics for TF2 if you manage to solve special balls-hard australium puzzles, only for nobody to recognize your genius in that game."
721,2393,"Great game, check it out."
722,2392,Best puzzle game on Steam. Highly recommended.
723,2392,Fun and extremely challenging. Not for the faint of heart.
724,2391,"Definitely the hardest game I have ever played, and by far the most satisfying! As someone who loves puzzles, logic and figuring things out this game is perfect, albeit incredibly difficult. Sometimes I just stare at the screen for half an hour wondering where to start, but preparation is paramount and once I have a basic flow diagram in my head of exactly where I want each particle to go, it's just a matter of linking it up, and that is half the battle won.Tip: Keep your reactors clear of mess by pacing your items very carefully - plan, plan, plan.This quote rings true here: ""Given ten hours to chop down a tree, I'll spend nine sharpening the axe.""All in all, easily worth the $10 if you enjoy hard puzzles and lateral logical thinking. If you're the type of person that sees a hard puzzle and gives up, you will not like this. This game is a challenge. But if you want to build your skills in programming, logic or just hard puzzles in general, then by all means check it out."
725,2391,"You don't need to know anything about chemistry to play this.Essentially, you're programming a set of machines to pull apart molecules and build new ones with the component atoms. There's in-game leaderboards so you can check your solutions against everyone else. It's pretty fun for a while, but it does eventually get kind of old."
726,2391,"this game stop working in mac several months , and they are not interested in fixing it. i want my money back"
727,2390,Probably the best puzzle game available.
728,2389,"If you enjoy: Learning Thinking Visual Programming Boolean Logic Mathematics Science Fiction Working on a problem for hours/days/weeks at a timeThen SpaceChem represents 30 - 100 hours (depending on your skill level) worth of 100% pure Heroin for you to inject at your leisure (or more likely, to consume as quickly as possible).There are over 50 levels worth of content in the main game, many of which will take several hours to complete, and once you're done with that there are also the hundreds of optional / additional levels on ResearchNet.Use with caution."
729,2388,Excellent puzzle game !Very addicitive when you get into it.
730,2387,"This review recommends Zachtronics' Spacechem as a phenomenally well-designed puzzle game with a great atmosphere, sure to challenge and addict.[. . .] No true fan of puzzle games should go through life without having experienced this title. Spacechem is elegant in its game-design simplicity and staggering in its gameplay complexity. This game is a satisfying yet relentless challenge, and its virtues do not end there. [. . .][Click here to continue reading this review]"
731,2387,"If you study/do anything related to process engineering and don't like this game, considering looking something else to do."
732,2387,"If you can beat this game, you should stop wasting your time and start programming your own games."
733,2386,This game haunts my dreams. It was a perfect learning/challenge curve and you'll find yourself thinking about puzzles long after you stopped playing.
734,2385,"So. You wanna play a puzzle game that uses actual elements.Of course you do. And you should. I can't beat the first level outside of the tutorial. But I had fun attempting.The soundtrack is amazing. its pure bliss and I love it.I love the soundtrack.Zactronics is really well known for making puzzle games that turn your brain into a smoothie. For that alone, its worth checking out.7/10"
735,2384,"Such complex and interesting gameplay. Helped me understand why GMO's are bad for the environment. No, there is nothing about GMO's in the storyline, but the allegory is there. As you build molecules and use them to trigger reactions, everything may look perfectly sound... but thousands of cycles later, an error you missed can crash your whole assembly. Kind of like how GMO's seem to be perfectly executing cycles of DNA, but what will happen generations down the line? Did that Monsanto geek honestly get it right the first time he spliced?Anyways, the game play of mixing chemicals and planning iterations is a lot of fun and takes a programmer's mind. If you love HARD puzzles, this is your game!"
736,2383,"My rating of ""Thumbs Up Recommend"" is more a reflection of the fact that _I_ liked this game, but I have no idea if _you_ will like this game.It's programmy-puzzly. The mechanics aren't chemistry-based at all (beyond topology of molecules), but rather it's thematically tied to chemistry. It's so unique I can't really compare it to anything.Play in bursts (i.e. play for several hours, then come back to it in a week or two).P.S. I like the music."
737,2381,"If you like puzzle games, you NEED to get this. It's witty, simple (but not easy) and absurdly addictive."
738,2381,"Design perfection.  Love this game - it's challenging/ stylish/ relaxing,  the music is awesome.  It's the perfect puzzle game."
739,2379,"I wanted a game that my school computer would run, and a game with enough content and replayability to pick up and play at any time. I got both. But it is very difficult."
740,2379,This is a game. It is good.  It is a good game.
741,2379,"By far, one of the most satisfying puzzle games on the market that really makes you think. The sense of achievement is beyond amazing upon completing the tougher challenges. Try SpaceChem today.  You'll be verbally abusing that useless monkey brain of yours in no time."
742,2378,"Great game! Gets  insanely hard, very fast! I am stuck about half way it is very annoying, then again less than 30% of the people who play have made it to the half way point and less than 4% have finished the game. It is a must have game"
743,2378,This game is great. It is a fun way to learn to think logically. It is a programmers delight. I'm looking forward to the other games by this group.
744,2378,One of the best puzzle games ever.
745,2378,Want a hard puzzle game? Look somewhere else because this is even harder than hard.My best advice for those who want to beat it is good luck.
746,2378,This feels like work.Why can't I stop playing?
747,2377,"TLDR;Perfectionist?  Obsessive-compulsive?  Nerdy/geeky?  Enjoy puzzles or patterns?Buy first and ask questions later, such as: ""Why the f-asterisk-ck wasn't I told about this game a long time ago?!""I don't know how to describe this but I'm both relaxed and excited after playing for about 20 minutes.  Watching the demo video, after I purchased the game, is what got me really interested.  This is a perfectionist's and obsessive-compulsive person's dream game, with a nerdy ""element"" to it.  Ba-dum ch.I got this game because of a coupon making it dirt-cheap, and I saw that it was a puzzle game and the screenshots were indicative of patterns.  I would've paid full price for this, but the coupon is what drew my attention to it...I wish Steam had a way of suggesting games like this.  I've invested more time in other games, but this may be the best video game brain food I've ever played.  You create your own puzzle/pattern, aim for perfection (if that's your thing), and it's an amazing mental outlet.  Hopefully it doesn't turn into an addiction to where I finish everything perfectly yet there's no more game to play ;)"
748,2376,"You're sitting in front of your computer, brain's smoking, hours and hours, you try this and that until you have to go to sleep. But you can't because it won't let go of you. After you finally manage to sleep, you get up in the morning and try it once again and there it is - BOOM - the solution. And as you watch the atoms connect and being transported to the reactor output you grow and become very proud. :-)SpaceChem doesn't have superior graphic, but it has something that is very rare nowadays - the potential to possess your brain make you addicted. Addicted to find the solution to the given quest. And the next one and next one and next one and so on. An absolute masterpiece!"
749,2375,"This is an absolutly fantastic puzzle game, probably the hardest puzzle game I have ever played in my life, every time you start a new puzzle it just seems impossible. The satisfaction of finally beating a puzzle and watching your reactors all work seamlessly is the best feeling ever, it feels like a real achievement when you beat each puzzle. I don't know if I will ever be able to finish this game but I already feel I have gotten my money's worth from this game and im only on the 4th world after 8 hours.Toughest puzzle game ever xD"
750,2375,"If you like logical puzzle games with rich backstory, get this one. If you like logical thinking, but hate typical puzzle games, get this one. It starts of easy and gets harder at just the right pace. If you don't like chemistry, don't worry, you can play this without knowledge of chemistry.oh, and if it has problems starting, try turning of the steam overlay, worked for me."
751,2375,"This is a pretty challenging game.  It is fun to spend a little time every few weeks beating a level or two, but it isn't one to go through in a single sitting.The chemistry is not realistic, but you will use real chemical formulas and their names.  This is more a programming puzzle that uses chemical names than a chemistry puzzle.  It is reminicent of Manufactoria, or Light-Bot."
752,2374,"It may not be real chemistry, but it's still intriguing."
753,2374,"You guys remember that episode of Star Trek The Next Generation where the USS Enterprise 1701-D kind of goes a little bit crazy and starts manufacturing a new life form in cargo bay five? The thing it builds, what is it? How do we know it's alive? Does it know it's alive? Is it alive? What does it like? Does it have feelings like we do? Where did it go? Will it be a good person or a bad person? Is it even a person? What does it mean to be a person? What do you think that it eats? Does it consume the ecosystems of planets to nourish itself? If it did, would the Enterprise have committed an atrocity? Why are fish cakes so delicious? Can we even understand what just happened? What does it mean to create artificial life? What if it destroys all other life as part of its lifecycle? What if it harbours a great hatred for all life but cannot do anything about it because it has no arms? Are we ready for the universe? Are we even ready for the solar system? What is life? What is anything?"
754,2374,Excellent puzzle game- I'm still working my way through it.
755,2374,"This is perhaps one of the greatest puzzle games in recent memory, on par with Portal, Braid, and Myst. The idea is deceptively simple, yet lying beneath the surface is an incredibly complex game that'll leave you scratching your head, drawing diagrams on napkins, and generally cursing the periodic table.And you'll love every minute of it. There's nothing quite like the satifaction of watching your tangled mess of a solution actually work. I only have two qualms with the game: The boss battles often involve incredibly precise timing which leads to a necessity for optimization of your spacechem reactors. Some people may like this, but I found it pretty tedious. Secondly, the difficulty ramps up IMMENSELY on the last few worlds and some of the final puzzles can take hours, days, or (in my case) over a week to work out a solution. As of this writing, less than 4% of SpaceChem players have even managed to finish the game. Despite these two dings, the game is unbelievably fun, relatively cheap, and a great mental work-out. Prepare to lose hours to chemistry and actually have fun doing so."
756,2373,This game is hard. harder than calculus. But it sure is fun. I simply couldn't put it down.92/100
757,2373,"I am neither smart enough, nor patient enough for this game.The parts I did do though? I felt like Einstein.Socks and sandals included."
758,2373,"very satisfying puzzle game 100% recomended for anyone a fan of the genre, it also helps to be interested in chemistry and/or space (space-chem)"
759,2372,This game made me realise how stupid I really am.11/10 would epiphany again except i'm afraid my brain would break.
760,2372,Don't judge a book by it's cover. This game will have you scratching your head and consume hours of your life. You will love the feeling of cracking a puzzel and the story is very engaging.
761,2372,"Really good puzzle game, may look intimidating at first but after you get the hang of it the game because really good.I recommend trying first the free demo since this game is not for everyone."
762,2372,Can't sleep trying to figure out how to improve my reactors.
763,2372,Play SpaceChem. It's a good game.
764,2371,"I love this game so much. It is tear-your-hair-out hard. Instructions are not as clear as I wish they are, and quite short. There is a lot of trial and error, which is both great and not great, depending on who you are. I personally really love how you get to try and do everything. The learning curve is high, but oh-so-satisfying."
765,2371,Really good game I would like the producer to make a game with logic gates in the future. =) I'm confident that this developer could make a game out of that considering how clever he or she is.
766,2371,"A fantastic game for engineers. First off, its obviosuly a unique puzzle game, not some stupid copy and paste candy crush. Its hard, you need to think about what youre going to do, and there will always be errors, so you need to troubleshoot and then fix it.Applied very well too, youre not beating monsters by moving colored rocks around, youre unbonding and bonding elements and molecular compounds. Great atmosphere.On top of it all, you arent scored, your time and resources used are simply compared with everyone else whos ever completed the same puzzle. Time and resources; the two most prominent objects of efficiency. Your goal is to make each puzzle as efficient as you can, which, when theyre not inventing new things, is pretty much every engineers job."
767,2371,"A very nice brain-bender that uses a lot of logical/programming skills. If you are interested in programming, this would be a nice instructional tool.The running story is nice to keep things moving. The use of multiple elements to create something else is neat. The campaign has a nice, even, yet gentle learning curve. There are multiple types of missions which helps to mix things up. You can solve a generic problem and make it a template for use in other missions if you come up with a great way to solve something.Very well done and polished."
768,2371,My logical brain is getting an intense workout with this. Such amaze. The epitome of my dream game. 10/10
769,2370,A complicated but very good game.
770,2370,"Simple layout, easy gameplay, challenged and made me feel inferior. All I could ever ask from a game."
771,2369,"A thinker, a REAL thinker. Excellent entertainment value. Loved the concept. Loved the music. If only I could pass the last (and hardest) level... (Also, I got items in TF2 for completing parts of SpaceChem, so bonus!) Plenty of community made levels out there too!"
772,2369,Too dumb to complete last puzzle :(.....10/10This game will make you feel a lot smarter.(If you can beat it.)
773,2368,"This is a puzzle game about making working assembly lines; in goes the materials, you make an assembly line, and out goes the required quantity of the required product (the chemical compounds).  The ""chemistry"" thing is a clever aesthetic conceit to make it so the simple objects you're assembling seem to have some real world grounding and help motivate you to solve the problems.  A cool thing about it is how open-ended it is for a puzzle game; as you run your assembly line, you get a count on how long it takes to output the quota of chemicals.  I've spent a lot of time going back to solutions that were good enough to pass, just to find ways to make them more efficient.  Sometimes this means making minor adjustments to reduce the pauses necessary to avoid collisions, sometimes it means changing the whole assembly line.  There's a lot of replayability here.One issue with that replayability is that there isn't an obvious way to back up your previous solutions (within the game that is), which made me reluctant to wipe the slate clean on my nicer solutions.  Obviously you could start a new game but that means playing puzzles you're not interested in at the time."
774,2368,Solid puzzle game. Infected my brain.
775,2367,"Easily one of my favourite puzzle games of all time. Spacechem is hard at first and quickly gets very hard leaving me feeling a bit dim sometimes. The machines I make are often way more complex than they should be,cumbersome and flawed for the most part. But that is what makes this game special in my opinion, there is usually many ways to solve the problems you are presented.Not for people who don't want to use a bit of grey mattter. If you like a game that will keep your brain working overtime even when you are not playing it then don't waste any more time get Spacechem now !"
776,2367,"This game is seriously, seriously  incredible.  I picked it up again after a year or two off and it's still just freaking amazing. The closest games I can think of that might come close to what it's like are Rocky's Boots and RobotWars (both Apple ][ games from the 80's)It teaches structured thinking, problem solving, chemistry, programming, ladder logic and engineering all at the same time.Playing it should be part of the high school science curriculum. Seriously."
777,2367,"2 points: 1) this game has nothing to do with chemistry, and little to do with space. 2) this is one of the most intelligent puzzle games I've played."
778,2367,"This is an amazing puzzle game!Good for kids, promotes concentration, problem solving, creative thinking.I've owned this for years, set it down for a while and came back, it's just very clever."
779,2366,Great game with difficult programming style puzzles.
780,2366,Possibly the best puzzle game ever made. Makes you feel like a mad scientist
781,2365,Stupendously nerdy and stupendously good.
782,2364,A fun and very challenging puzzle game.
783,2364,SpaceChem is a puzzle game with a chemistry twist. Would have loved to have this game when I was going through Organic Chemistry it would have helped explain some things that confused me in the early stages of my classes. I like how the game saves the previous accomplished games to help figure out the current puzzle.
784,2364,"One of the best puzzle games I've ever played, and by far the best I've paid for"
785,2364,"HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, with remarks.This is a great puzzleing game but, stay away of it if you don't want to loose lots of hours or even days trying to find out a solution. You've been warned!.The game starts with easy to understand tutorials and easy puzzles and then, difficulty increases puzzle after puzzle up to the hell.The overall goal for each puzzle is to get some atoms or molecules and transform them, to send the results to some storage  later.To transform particles, you use reactors. Each reactor can have up to two input and two ouput spots. You chain reactors and storages through pipes. You can chain reactors to produce the final product with the help of intermediate products.Reactors have some kind of program, with some special instructions: wait for input, grab, drop, rotate, bind, unbind, sync, branch if certain atom is being detected, flush the output area, etc. You will have to ""program"" a sequence of instructions to solve the puzzle and, just with the instructions and tools available for each puzzle.Graphics are good and attractive enough for this particular kind of game. The User's Interface is clear, easy to learn and, easy to use, very straight forward. You can do everything with just the mouse or, you can use keyboard shortcuts if you like it.The game was very well programmed, has no glitches, works smoothly and, seems to be very well optimized.This game is one on its kind. The idea is very original and, even that game mechanics sound so easy that can end boring you, the real thing is that puzzles are so challenging that you don't have such a feeling.But, be aware, if you don't like games that challenge your mind, don't buy this one; after a few of short easy puzzles you will face really challenging ones.I could say this is a casual game but, believe it, once you start a challenging puzzle, you will loose hours or days trying to figure out a solution. It's highly addictive.You can learn from solutions already designed by other people, by watching some youtube video (and, yes, you will do that), To beat the rest of community of players, you should solve the puzzles by using the less ammount of cycles (production cycles), the less amount of resources (reactors, storages, etc.) and the less amount of symbols (programming instructions). If to figure out a solution is challenging by itself, imagine how hard can be trying to beat other ""engineers"" (that's how the game calls to the player)."
786,2363,Like programming meets... fake chemistry? Idk
787,2362,"This game is the most difficult thing I have ever played. As someone who is bad at puzzle games, this game left me in tears. I took years to beat this game, which in this case is a good sign because it shows how well-designed and good the puzzles are. Absolutely love this game."
788,2362,"I find a lot of puzzle games to be derivative and unoriginal, but SpaceChem is a breath of fresh air. The tools you are given to create elements seems to never stop and the intense complexity of some of the later levels borders on a form of cerebral torture which makes the solutions all the more rewarding when you get there. I often find myself chanting ""YOU CAN DO IT, YOU CAN DO IT"" before it's 3AM and I haven't inserted the right number of flip-flop sync cycles to detach 2 hydrogen atoms and bind them with Silicon and Phosphorous which come as inputs in a seemingly random order. Wut?There are often many ways of doing things, but you are benchmarked for your efficieny in the leaderboards versus other players. Generally your 1st solution is terrible, but nothing is more satisfying than coming up with a 10x more efficient design than everyone else.Thoroughly enjoyable game and without a doubt the most cerebrally taxing game I have ever owned."
789,2360,Good game
790,2360,Simultaneously the most frustrating and the most rewarding game I've ever played.I'm almost done zone 4. I'm too scared of zone 5 to keep playing.10/10 will induce emotional trauma
791,2359,First 15 minutes: What the he!! is going on? So complicated! (and the graphic's not the best)Next 45 minutes: Oh I'm so smart!Onwards: NVM why am I so stupid?
792,2359,"If you like puzzle games you will probably love this one, otherwise you will most probably hate it."
793,2358,"So disappointed I didn't come across this game sooner. I absolutely love it, coming from a person who studies, works in and has an interest in Science and Chemistry.Logical puzzle games have always been a favorite of mine, and I will play anything that is fun and also stimulates me intellectually. I love that the developers have kept it pretty scientifically realistic (periodic table, bonding, names of compounds (although some homonuclear molecules like N2 are called nitrogen, when actually should be dinitrogen, and carbon monoxide appears as a double bound molecule when is actually triple bound)). The soundtrack is also awesome, I love the track 7.ogg (doesn't have a name)."
794,2357,Great puzzler. Completely holds up to the test of time. Brilliant soundtrack as well.
795,2357,Beware of this game! it will push your logic and problem-solving skills to the limit.You'll probably need a brain transplant if you manage to beat it.
796,2357,This game has it all:Strategy -- CHECKPuzzle -- CHECKChemistry -- CHECKMultithreading -- CHECKRuntime effiency  -- CHECKIndustrial Engineering -- CHECKIf those categories combined give you nerd chills then this is the game for you.
797,2357,Gets insufferable pretty quick
798,2357,"I'm a professional programmer with minor optimization OCD, and these puzzles very quickly ramp up to my problem-solving DEFCON level titled ""I give up!  Time for BRUTE FORCE!  <evil laughter>"".Do I lose my coder license if I can't beat this game?  I hope not.  :|"
799,2357,Taught me more about chemistry then any teacher ever could.10/10 Would defeat monsters with science again.
800,2357,"A programming puzzle that made me want to scream everytime I messed something up majorly and had to start over.Is it possible to complete without looking up walkthroughs? Probably. I tried. I got about a third of the way through then wanted to punch my computer and stopped.Maybe one day I'll do it. The story is fantastic. I don't think I really understood everything.If you're a  genious, buy this game. Personly, it felt like more work than fun but I like programming so this kind of work IS fun to me."
801,2356,Easily the most satisfying puzzle game I've ever played.
802,2356,it's good
803,2356,
804,2355,Very cool game. Complicated fun with chemistry. For people who like their mind challeged and thinking logistically.
805,2354,"this stuff is awesome. It looks simple, but it gets complex fast, without making it artificially so. Play the demo, and if you enjoy, this is really recommended."
806,2353,I love this game although IT GETS ANNOYINGLY HEADACHELY ANNOYING! If you like puzzles that are ANNOYING this game is for you!
807,2353,"SpaceChem is... confusing to say the least. It looked like a highly enjoyable puzzle game that was fairly cheap. I was badly mistaken. It could easily be just me, however I found that there were really no good instructions. I'm sure I'll try again in the future, but for now I'm sticking with my opinion."
808,2352,"Spacechem is absolutely beautiful. It manages to capture the magic of computer programming and make its joys accessible to a wider audience.Let me talk about actual programming for a minute. Programming is 90% problem-solving, 9% frustration, and 1% elation over the feeling of dominance. You start with a goal in mind; creating a program for a specific function. Via problem-solving, you figure out how to tell the computer to do what you want it to do. Once your program is finished, you run it, and find out it doesn't work. That's where the frustration comes in. You tweak your code, you run, it fails again. Lather, rinse, repeat about once per ten lines of code, then...VOILA! IT WORKS! It's a great feeling that I can't possibly describe sufficiently.Spacechem's gameplay follows the exact same process. You start with a goal in mind; taking given input molecules and turning them into given output molecules. Via problem-solving, you figure out how to tell the game what you want it to do. Once your program is finished, you run it and find out something went horribly wrong. You tweak the commands, run it again, fail again, repeat again, until eventually...SUCCESS! YOU ARE WINRAR! You feel like a total bada**."
809,2352,"Amazing, I have no words."
810,2351,great puzzle
811,2351,"Simply the best, most frustrating, most well-made, most fun puzzle game ever made. If you're into breaking your head over gamese, this is the one for you. Also, the chemistry going has nothing to do with the real world, so don't you worry about that."
812,2350,"While not the prettiest or most streamlined game, SpaceChem is a fantastically open-ended puzzle-solver. It's not just about accomplishing goals; it's about doing so as efficiently as possible, with that efficiency ranked against other players'. The ""chemistry"" at its heart may be bogus, but seeing your scratch-designed reactor(s) churn out an efficient stream of re-bonded molecules like a well-oiled machine is incredibly satisfying. Just be prepared for a few frustrations once you get out of the basic challenges."
813,2349,+ Hidden educational value+ Original concept+ Hard+ Reactor chaining- Graphics
814,2348,If you like having your mind blown then this is the game for you. Make your way through these brain teasers as you learn more and more about SCIENCE!!
815,2348,Don't buy this game.  Only 30% of people have completed the first few levels and 3% have completed the game.  It becomes unreasonably difficult extremely quickly.  Only purchase this game if you enjoy failure and masochistic puzzle-solving.
816,2348,They weren't joking around when they mentioned this game was somewhat difficult...Ludicrous puzzles that will make your head explode! :D11/10
817,2348,"SpaceChem is an engineering puzzle game, in that the puzzles are about figuring out how to build a machine to process objects rather than to directly find your way through what's already been placed there for you. If that sounds appealing, this is probably the puzzle game for you! Just as you're building machines, it's building you into a machine maker. There's very little in the way of filler, and virtually every assignment offers something new for the player to learn from and apply, which is excellent pacing. That can be a bit frustrating when you're stuck on one without other options available, but perseverance will win the day.Highly recommended for puzzle game enthusiasts and programmers."
818,2348,"If you're hardcore into puzzle games, this may be for you.  It was not for me. The actual gameplay was a bit bland.  I dunno if i just never got past the tutorial part, but i never saw anything other than what you see in the screenshots with the red and blue bits on black background.  The gameplay wasn't exciting enough to provoke the kind of attention and thought needed to actually learn the game and be good at it.TLDR: I don't know if the end of the game is good, because the beginning was too boring to keep me engaged."
819,2348,One of the best puzzle games ever created.One of the hardest puzzle games ever created.
820,2348,That god I had this for my Chemistry exam. I'm just waiting for the good results to come in.
821,2348,"Damn this game is hard. Great puzzler, but boy do you have to stop and think. I'm going to re-buy it for iPad so I can be frustrated in bed too."
822,2348,Very good game with many challenging puzzles but if you know chemistry its much more enjoyable
823,2348,Fair warning: this game/puzzler gets to be difficult fairly quickly. Still a very cool and rewarding game.
824,2348,"This is a game for nerds.I am a nerd.I am not sure if I like this game, whenever I complete a level I feel this overwhelming insecurity that this might have been the last one that I would be able to complete and that I might be stupid.I then spend way too much time on the next level and as I complete it the cycle continues.I will steal a quote from somebody elses review 'This is a game for when you are feeling smart and want to be proven otherwise'.I am now gonna finish this review, I have a reactor to design..."
825,2348,"This game is not for the impatient. Serious puzzle solving, lots of thinking and planning involved. Challenge escalates rapidly. Good luck with that."
826,2347,This is genuinely the best puzzle game that has ever been made.
827,2347,"Don't worry, it's not actually about chemistry. As a lot of people in the reviews will tell you, however, it **is** a game about programming, to an extent. The general flow of the game involves taking a fixed set of inputs and figuring out a specific set of instructions that will produce the desired output for the level. It's an extremely simple approach to puzzle design, but that's where SpaceChem shines. Because every level can generally be described as a brief list of inputs and outputs, puzzles will stick in your mind for long after you step away from the computer, and you can spend a lot of time thinking about solutions wherever you are.Spacechem's greatest, strength, though, is it's difficulty curve. The game does a superb job of introducing an enormous amount of unique mechanics at a rate that makes them feel exciting instead of overwhelming. You always feel like you're playing with a larger set of tools than you had previously, and it rarely feels like too much to handle. That said, the game is far from easy. It takes a lot of real, genuine thought to complete a lot of this game's levels, but the satisfaction that comes from seeing your convoluted series of instructions running in a perfect loop is immensely satisfying.At the end of the day, Spacechem is a puzzle game, and a fairly challenging one. If you're looking for something to tickle your brain a little, you really can't go wrong with SpaceChem."
828,2347,"Easily one of the most daring, intelligent and thought-provoking puzzle game I've ever played. Big tip of the hat to the developers!"
829,2347,"I highly, highly recommend this game. It's easy to grasp the concept, but very difficult to master. The puzzles become difficult fairly quickly, providing hours of frustrating entertainment - I find myself thinking about SpaceChem while I'm doing other things. It's unlikely I'll ever be able to beat the game, but it's already absolutely been worth the purchase."
830,2347,"You know that feeling where you can spend hours meticulously working on a solution to a puzzle game only to find out at the very end that it won't work, and so you spend even more hours attempting to kludge it to work and then the entire thing becomes a mess but now you've invested all this time and you don't want to have to start from scratch? Well I have kidney stones"
831,2347,"This game is basically about programming. Amazing solutions arise from really basic concepts. Your creation is always in the center, not cluttered by any awkward prefabricated elements.Game controls are awesome: everything is well-thought, there are even keyboard shortcuts.Nice music too."
832,2347,A really fun puzzle game.
833,2347,"I definitely recommend this game if you like puzzles/programming. Each level you have to construct a kind of flow-chart to convert one type of molecule to another, but you only have so much space to work with and can't have things collide with one another!It can be very challenging, but there are lots of solutions available online if you do find yourself really stuck on one level. There are also hundreds of levels made by the community that give the game a huge lifespan. Just be careful because it can become a huge timesink!Overall I rate it 9/10"
834,2347,Best chemical engineering* game ever! *Master's Degree Required
835,2347,10/10would spend 10 hours sciencing agian
836,2347,"It's been a while since I've been ""totally delighted"" with a game and I'm quite surprised to find this game is just that.  Bugs are few (the occassional crash to desktop) but even when they happen the game is saved and nothing is lost.  Puzzles are fun to solve and replayability is fun because you often improve your previous solutions.  The only feature I found lacking was a ""reset"" button for the reactor to clear out all the commands set.  Other than that, this game is ""EXTREMELY"" well put together!  If you're into puzzles, you need this one in your inventory.  I'm looking forward to trying out Infinifactory."
837,2347,"What initially appears to be a chemistry-related puzzle game reveals itself to be (multithreaded!) programming with limited hardware and a suspiciously Lovecraftian story. Difficulty is high, but in a scrupulously fair way."
838,2347,Do you ever wish you could spend your entire day debugging programs but don't want to learn a programming language/do actual work? Then this is the game for you!
839,2346,"This game frustrates me beyond belief, and in a way I haven't felt since the Genesis days: angry enough to punch my screen and give up in defeat, before the need to win gnaws at me enough to compel persistence.  Beating a level makes me feel complete as a person.Games rewarding as this are too rare."
840,2346,"+complex+interesting+challenging+well designed+rewards creativity+straightforward visuals+very cheap+great value-can sometimes feel like bashing your head against a brick wall (this is not the game you want to play after a 12 hour shift)this game is a lot like programming. a lot like work in general- great work, challenging work, but still...not the mindless fun you might be looking for in a game."
841,2346,"Programming, the game."
842,2346,"Brilliant in it's simplicity, cleverly challenging, and extremely satisfying. In an age when games have increasingly dumbed-down problem solving and puzzles, SpaceChem provides a refreshing challenge."
843,2346,"This is possibly my favourite puzzle game ever. It's not well balanced, so you might find very hard puzzles followed by easier ones, but it really is fantastic. Instead of a linear difficulty level you have more like a ""ups and downs"" sort of difficulty pattern.If you're afraid of Chemistry don't be, because it's all fictional.A must buy for everyone."
844,2346,"Best 99c i've spent. This game just repeadedly stabs your brain with a screwdriver, but will keep you asking for more, it's brilliant, seductive tortrure. Even when you solve the puzzle, and think you done a pretty good job. The game will point out how poorly and inefficient your design was, and this will strive you replay the level in order to redeem yourself.Just buy it."
845,2346,Best puzzle game since TetrisHardAsBalls/10
846,2346,"do any of you have fond memories of building massive factories in minecraft with mods?from the REAL mind behind minecraft, comes a game ENTIRELY ABOUT BUILDING FACTORIES. IT IS GOOD."
847,2345,"In my 25+ years of playing computer games, I've never seen a puzzle game as compelling and satisfying as SpaceChem. It's easily better than the classics (something you don't say easily), and it's head and shoulders above the often excellent contemporaries.You build molecule factories in an almost-sandbox environment, with gradually ramping up complexity - all the puzzles have many solutions, and there's great replay value in optimizing your designs. If you like a challenge, just jump into it and see for yourself :)"
848,2345,"It's not a game for everyone. Walls of text, crude mechanics and a rather high difficulty.BUTIf you have grasped the logic you can spend many hours in this game.I enjoyed testing and planning my reactors step by step and spent hours with constructing the best possible way for each goal.It's a good game if you like puzzles without time pressure and for small money"
849,2344,"Though it is indeed based on ""Chem"", it doesn't really have anything to do with it gameplay-wise. It's a really good puzzle game, though, and a hard one on later levels. Recommended. (y)"
850,2344,"Though daunting to look at, SpaceChem introduces elements slowly and doesn't drop the challenge on you until you've proven yourself capable. This is without question the most rage-inducing yet ultimately satisfying puzzler I've ever played and if you're remotely tempted, you have no reason not to try the generous demo."
851,2344,"I REALLY wish the chemical reactions, reactants products bond angles polarities and all the sciencegasm jazz was accurate"
852,2343,"This game is simply awesome. You get to learn a little bit of chemistry and the basics of programming, intuitively and while having a lot of fun! I'm still on the early problems, and the game does a great job of slowly easing you into new mechanics and situations (e.g. bonding molecules, ouputting two different molecules, etc). Great little game for the price, and an awesome way of learning!"
853,2343,A very fun and challenging puzzle game. It's difficult to master but very rewarding when you complete a puzzle.
854,2343,"Bought this game + DLC for under $3.00 back in 2012 during a sale.This is a very unique puzzle game. Some puzzles can be tough and/or time consuming. You build ""systems"" to construct molecules. You do not need a background in chemistry to understand this game. It has the atomic arrangements shown to you. These systems may or may not be automated by your design choice (later levels you can incorporate switchs in your system if you need to send certain molecules elsewhere i.e. Left thruster, or right thruster to move/dodge in a boss fight.. yes BOSS FIGHTS). Did I mention there are boss levels? No, they are not fast paced or epic, but is appropriate for this game IMO.Some unique design capabilities include bonding, fusion, and teleporting.MUST HAVE PATIENCE,There is a leaderboard on efficiency of different categories such as least cycles (time unit), least symbols used, least reactors used and any I might have forgotten.To obtain 100% of the achievements, I played this game on and off for TWO YEARS. Some steam achievements are pretty intimidating and may stress you out and make you feel hopeless and not know where to even begin :DHowever, I enjoyed this game and even purchased a copy for a friend so I would recommend it to puzzle lovers.My advice is to play this game in moderation unless you are a masochist lol.tl;dlSpent $3.00 for game + dlc (extra puzzles)It is a systems design game where you construct things. Chemistry themed. No background needed.There are BOSS FIGHTS >.>Some puzzles are tough and some Steam achievements are very intimidating. MUST have patience for this game.There is a leaderboard for each puzzle with different categories of efficiency (least cycles, least symbols used, etc).I played on and off for TWO YEARS to obtain all the achivements.Rating 8/10 (+2 Price, +2 Uniqueness, +2 Open Design Solutions, +1 One of the few games that forced me to take a break from occasionally, +1 A LOT of optional puzzles to keep you busy after you completed the main campaign)"
855,2343,Great puzzle game that gets very hard very fast. It's highly rewarding to beat the later levels.
856,2343,Buy it NOW!
857,2343,If you like challanging puzzle games that make you think outside of the box this game is definitely for you
858,2343,"This is fabulous value for money (bought for under a pound in the sale). A really original idea, that stretches the brain cells. A ""just one more try before I go to bed"" type game. Highly recommended."
859,2343,"I was initially put off of this game by the fact that windowed mode wouldn't fit on my screen and couldn't be resized.I started to seriously dislike it I saw the external youtube link disguised as a level.Decided to give it a chance anyway, but put it down following a tutorial level which just directed me to do a bunch of stuff without intelligibly explaining the significance of any of it."
860,2342,"Really enjoying this game. A unique puzzle game.  If you like puzzle games I highly recommend it, you will not be disappointed.  My only disapointment is that the puzzles have become complicated quickly, removing some of that quick, neat building charm."
861,2342,"This is a great little puzzler, fusing brain twisting logic and interesting chemical science.I highly recommend this game and offer my compliments to the developers."
862,2342,"What a fun game for programmers. It's like trying to master a multi-threaded Turing machine simulation or something. I really enjoy the challenge of creating solutions and then optimizing them.Nothing like watching a well designed reactor shuttle molecules around, turn them, bring them together just in time  and the have them carried off somewhere else. Often you make something that works and you have no idea why it works or how you did it. But then you have to go back in and tweak it. Yup, this is exactly what programming is like.My only complaint are the defense missions which often require too much player input - one can't just leave the production line running - and trial and error poking around."
863,2341,Amazingly challenging puzzle game. 21 hours in and only on world 3 out of like 10.
864,2340,"An amazing puzzle game and great mental workout, highly recommended."
865,2340,"If your up for a good puzzler, this is the way to go. excellent use of logic, and a high replay value to get your solutions as efficient as possible."
866,2340,"This game is one of the best games I have played. It lets you build orginal unique design concepts to finish the puzzle. Simple set of rules, many ways to get the end result. I strongly recommend this game to someone who likes to have their brains really tested."
867,2339,"SpaceChem is a puzzle game that deals with atoms and molecules.I don't really think the story makes that much sense, but where this game really excells is in the puzzles.The game is made up of chapters and levels. Each chapter will introduce one or two new new gameplay features. The levels take you through an easy tutorial of how to use the new element, and gets progressively more challenging. This learning curve is very good.As for how the levels themselves work, you are given various tools and a grid. The job is to move elements (like hydrogen/carbon etc.) around, and join them to form molecules which you then pipe out. It initially seems easy but once you add mulitple reactors piping out to each other it quicky adds more of a challenge.My only issue is, if I find myself becoming fixated on ridiculously complicated solutions. You can't skip levels if you are finding them too complicted. This means if you are completely stuck and can't progress unless you can solve each level sequentially.This game is controlled with a mouse, but has keyboard shortcust to make things easier to control. This works really well, in my opinion.The graphics are very simple, which is good as it makes it easy to see what exactly you're doing.The music and sounds in this game are very nice.There are extra challenges included once you complete the game, and ones that can earn you extras in TF2, it seems. This coupled with the wide number of challenges means the game definitely has a very good play-through time.Definitely buy this game if you like puzzles, but don't buy it for it's chemical/scientific accuracy."
868,2338,"This game involves a lot of spatial thinking. Building tracks to manipulate molecules, and then making them more efficient. It really makes you think, and the story is actually really interesting. Chemistry is fun!"
869,2338,Very challenging game with a unique and stragenly educational puzzle mechanic.
870,2337,"Having played through the base game, Spacechem is a great puzzle game at it's core. Pros - The puzzles. They become increasing harder as you go along, but it is pretty steady. Each set of puzzles build on skills you have acquired from the previous. There are challenges associated with many of the puzzles. You do not have to complete them to beat the game, but they really make you think and work for the achievement. They can be tough, but I enjoyed solving them. Nothing in the game is forced on you with the challenges and achievements. It saves your progress so you can keep moving forward in the game and go back later to beat the challenges. I really felt a sense of accomplishment finishing this game. Many puzzle games become the a+b =c formula and thus, boring. Space Chem held to the end.The controls and UI worked really well. Learning the hotkeys helps. There are many videos on You Tube. Really cool after you beat a puzzle, you can see how others did it. I did not see any of my solutions online and there are may ways to solve each one. The instruction on new tools were good. Told you what you needed to know and left you to figure out how to employ them. The periodic chart was a useful addition.Cons  The story outside the puzzles was a cheese sandwich with the crust (Try eating one and you'll see what I mean, dry and chewy, just sayin'). Not the worst I have seen, but after while I didn't bother. I mention this only to point out it does not take away from the great puzzles. That is the heart of this great gem. If you don't like the story, skip it. The graphics do not interfere with the game at all. They were functional. I highly recommend this game if you enjoy puzzles that challenge your critical thinking and problem solving abilities. This is an exceptional game. Skip the story, solve the puzzles. You'll feel smarter, I do."
871,2336,I have played SpaceChem for 7 hours now and I am totally hooked. The puzzles are very intelligent (and sometimes very hard) but you get a real sense om accomplishment when you finally figure it out. The puzzles have amazing depth and it seems that you continously learn new tricks. I am a programmer in real life and SpaceChem will teach you skill applicable in the field. Highly recommended. Give it a try!
872,2336,"SpaceChem is one of those games that's similar to grime underneath your fingernails.. you'll pick at it persistently until you get it out - or in this case, figure it out. The feeling of accomplishment that washes over you once a puzzle is finished is quite rewarding.The game, quickly, gets quite difficult; but if you truly love puzzles.. this is a masterpiece - and it certainly deserves to be in your collection."
873,2336,"This game is not about chemistry, its about programing, procedures, and analitic thinkingvery similar to the flash game ""light-bot""you have to use the provided commands, to move arround ""atoms"" to get the requested outputvery fun. very addictive. totally worth every cent"
874,2335,"Spacechem teaches you how to think link a software engineer. A light but interesting plot guides you through the otherwise grey but challenging gameplay. After the linear tutorial levels, each problem requires a freeform, unique design using simple, common principles. The main quest itself takes this format to a satisfying conclusion, but there's also a community workshop if you want more content.I wish I had this game when I was a junior in high school.The graphics and sound effects are simplistic but functional enough and of expected quality for an indie puzzle game."
875,2335,"Oh my, what a game... I DO recommend.Ok, it is more a puzzle than a game. Like abstract games are a specific category for boardgames, you know? In the end, a bit like Myst games are into videogaming. I love Myst, by the way. So be careful, and don't expect crazy HUD, action and all. It is a Puzzle.But my... great music (although not enough variety), nice drawings (outer maps), hard boss, very, very easy to learn (tutorial a tad confusing, though), but MAN very, very HARD to progress! The curve is not straight, I'm telling you. I finished the five or six first worlds (planets), and damn have I been stuck for MONTHS! But I'll play that game anytime if I have new ideas (I refuse to look at the walkthroughs or clues). Great, great, great, game.My other Reviews. Join me on Twitch and Discord!"
876,2334,Probably the single best puzzle game I have ever played.
877,2334,"One of the absolute best puzzle games ever made.The ""engineering"" feel of it may intimidate some players, but that's part of what I love about it.If in doubt try the demo, but do try it before dismissing it, it's brilliant."
878,2334,Thoroughly addictive.
879,2334,"Basically, a tutorial in realistic parallelization of tasks.Like everything else from this developer, it's basically programmer/engineer training for how to sove problems."
880,2333,"Feel clever for completing really hard puzzles, then feel stupid when you look at videos of other people doing a way better job of solving them.Gripping boss fights remind us that chemists could someday save the universe."
881,2333,A different kind of puzzle game. Highly recommended for folks who want a different perspective on normal puzzle games.
882,2331,"Overall: Good to Very goodLikes:- kind of like programming- open-ended puzzles where the focus is on engineering the solutions- challenging- for additional challenge, you can optimize your solutions to minimize the number of cycles, symbols, or reactorsDislikes:- the multi-stage puzzles require a lot of time and work to solve, even when you see the solution.  I felt that the short puzzles with small, achievable goals were more fun and accessible.- campaign puzzles are progress-locked"
883,2331,"Awesome Game! Good puzzler introducing chemical compounds, even if they aren't the proper method of chemical synthesis for said compounds..."
884,2330,"i feel as though playing this game is much akin to arguing with people on the internetyou weave all manner of points together to create something cohesive that flows well, sometimes the process gets too annoying and you save a problem for later, you roll all these ideas around in your head and plan your move. this might be the most autistic game i've ever played but that is not necessarily a bad thingit's definately not a game you can just rush through in a single evening lest you're some manner of savant"
885,2330,10/10
886,2329,"This game is all about beating puzzles, by building logic machines.  If that sounds like fun, then this game is deffinitly for you."
887,2328,"The most satisfying puzzle game I have ever played. I found the mechanics kinda difficult to grasp at the beginning but the basic principles are fairly easy to understand. Basically, you are building molecules out of atoms (who would have guessed). You start the game with one reactor that has 2 ""circuits"" in it, you can modify shape of these circuits and put different commands on them that will input/output atoms, grab them, bond them together, you can also rotate the molecules and do other stuff with them that I don't know about yet since I am not too far into the game.Later on, you will be given multiple reactors that can all be ""programmed"" separately giving the game a whole new level. For instance, you can have one reactor that will be used to brake bonds between atoms, then it will output them to another reactor that will bond them together with different atoms to form the molecule that you need. Now all of this sounds like you need a degree in chemistry and physics to be able to play the game but that is absolutely not the case. It's all logical, you don't need to know absolutely anything about chemistry or any other science.What some people may dislike about this game is that it ramps up the difficulty fairly quickly but a nice thing is that all the solutions are always saved and you can revisit previous levels to go over the basics again, experiment or improve your designs. Because unlike many other puzzle games where you are merely trying to find the single solution that the developers invented, in Spacechem there are hundreds if not thousands of solutions to every level and there is even online workshop kind of thing where you can download player-created levels and also upload your own (I hope that's what it's for, I have never actually used it :D), giving the game a HUGE replay value. I can imagine sinking hundreds upon hundreds of hours into this.Even though I am not very good at puzzle games and I doubt I will ever finnish this one because the difficulty gets absolutely ridiculous in later levels from what I've seen on youtube, I have to recommend Spacechem. It's extremely original, challenging, satisfying and fun. What more could you possibly ask of a puzzler? It even has a story! I haven't really followed it too much but it's there and sometimes you get a story-related mission like the one I recently got where I had to destroy a giant bulldozer closing in on our base by filling some tanks with methane causing them to explode in it's face!"
888,2327,"Unique gameplay. Puzzle game that is Challenging and requires much thought and Diligence No 1 specific way to win the levels (which is awesome for a puzzle game)A little tiring after playing it a lot, but a great game to go back to after a few years. :)"
889,2326,"So. I like chemistry and puzzle games. And SPAAAAACE.This game is a brilliant combination of these elements (pun intended), and I really should get round to finishing it.AND SO SHOULD YOU."
890,2326,"Perfect game for every software or electrical engineer.  Difficult, but very satisfying when you finish a level."
891,2326,"If you like complex problem solving puzzles then this is the game for you.  The only real drawback is the lack of an adequate tutorial on how everything works.  The game only gives you very basic information and it was a bit frustrating, to me, figuring out how some things work.  You can find tips online however to help.That said once you get the hang of things you can literally spend hours, if not days, working on a single puzzle.  Then you can work on the puzzle some more, if you choose, to optimize it to use less symbols or time.I recommend the game because I like complex puzzles but if you are looking for something quick and easy ... keep looking."
892,2325,The best puzzle game out there. Also one of the more difficult ones.
893,2325,"This game is pure genius. When it comes to puzzle games I have never played anything so complex. Basically its like visual programming meets chemistry in a super clever puzzle game with its own set of rules which you must complete a task in. I want everyone in the world to play this game but I can't recommend it to anyone, because its so hard and abstract only a certain type of person will like this game. If you are a programmer this game will probably appeal to you. It takes weeks sometimes to complete a puzzle later on and its extremely rewarding when it finally works."
894,2324,"it looks good but dont buy it, its not worth it. I have a 1920x1080 screen and whatever i do it wont work, there is always a problem with the resolution. So except if you are a professional, dont buy it, otherwise buy it on your tablet."
895,2324,A great game to get if you're into puzzles.
896,2323,"What's this? A game with entirely logic based puzzles, multiple solutions, and it's an indie game without a pretentious story?So let's just go over this again:-Puzzle game-Logic based-Near infinite solutions to puzzles-Satisfying to complete-An actually cool story that's 100% optionalThis game is how a  video game should be. Gold star of approval."
897,2323,Think of it as a game where you have to program a robotic factory to build widgets. 8.5/10
898,2322,"This game is not for everyone, but it's one of the best puzzle games I've played in a long time; even long after I shut the game down, my brain keeps pondering ways to improve my solutions.You are tasked with constructing automata (""reactors"") and pipelines to take atoms and molecules, and break them apart and recombine them to form different molecules.  Building requires dragging and dropping visual components, a kind of ""visual programming"".  It's a little like ""The Incredible Machine"" in that regard; without the Rube-Goldberg-esque humour, but far more deep and challenging.Any successful design will get you past a level, but if you're like me you'll continually revisit your solutions and try to improve them, by using fewer components, or making more efficient solutions."
899,2322,"This game is actualy one of the best logical puzzles that I ever played.It's challenging, but rewarding, it is based on real life chemistry, and it combines it with interesting puzzles. I honestly think, that games like Space Chem can be used in schools to make education more fun and attractive to people.I strongly recommend to give it a try if you want to challenge your brain."
900,2322,"Great indie puzzle game, and without much parallel from what I've seen.There were great puzzles in the actual game, and much more in the researchnet when you've finished the game. There isn't much actual chemistry in the game; it's used more as a basis for the puzzles. The storyline was good, the visuals were fine. The reason why this game stands out is the open-endedness of the puzzles; finding your own solution and improving upon it is the main thrill of this game, and the euphoria of completing a puzzle or optimizing your design to the most efficient possible is where this game gets its fun. There bell curves (usually) in the missions, which tell you how well your solution is compared to others.I've been told that this game is quite similar to programming, which may drive you away or towards this game. I find it more about making a machine and watching it work as it executes commands the way you programmed it.On the other side, I'd say that the graphics in the reactors themselves are rather bland, but I can excuse that as it would become too complex if it weren't bland. I'd prefer if the game had told me what you can do and what you can't do with the molecules (can't collide), and there are some hidden tricks which are not mentioned at all (bonder priority, especially, though particle smashing to a lesser extent as well). The music also may get a bit repetitive (I personally can't get tired of it though).Other than that, this game is quite an amazing puzzle game. I'd recommend it for anyone looking for an intellectual challenge."
901,2322,Mind bending!
902,2322,"Spacechem is a very demanding game.  It asks you, the player, to be creative and logical, to come up with your own answers for seemingly-intractable problems.  How well you receive the game will depend on how much you enjoy this type of challenge.If you get stuck on the main storyline, your only real recourses are to 1. keep hammering at it, 2. search out a video of how someone else did it for inspiration, or 3. take a break and try some of the side-missions.  These are available in the 'research net' section, and are user-created challenges released periodically.  They can also be undertaken in any order you wish.The only strikes against the game are:  Some features are not fully explained in terms of how they interact, so you have to do a bit of experimentation.  The working space and other limitations can be a real bear in some levels (i.e.. if you just had a bit more room to breathe, it would be a lot less frustrating).  They will frequently introduce some cool new feature in one mission series, show you how to use it, test you on it, then abandon it going forward.  You'll come to a level and think ""ok, I just have to set this up with some switches/sensors/whatever, and I'll be good to..  they took those out?!  WTF!""The defense levels are a little forced, and don't work all that well, in my opinion.As far as procedural puzzlers go, it's top notch."
903,2322,"Brilliant puzzle game. Gets you thinking, and (may) help you learn (a little) about chemistry.And fishcakes."
904,2322,"Definitely recommended with a couple caveats:- Some puzzles will take hours/days to solve. You will be thinking about these puzzles during your spare time. You may even start keeping/carrying around a notepad to sketch possible solutions on. - You WILL get very frustrated. However, my advice is to NOT look up the answers, because again, the satisfaction you'll get from solving a level you've worked at for days is worth it. This game has caused more frustration than any game I can remember since the NES era. It's THAT hard. The difficulty spikes something fierce after only a couple levels. However, I can say that very few, if any, games have caused me to feel so satisfied from solving one of the levels. If you like solving puzzles no matter how high the difficulty, look no further than this game."
905,2321,awesome
906,2321,"I hope my children will be interested in games of this caliber when the time is right.  VIsual programming, spacial relation, and compartmentalization at its best."
907,2321,Very satisfying game. Intricate puzzles with tons of different ways to solve them. Highly recommended to anyone who likes brain teasers.
908,2321,"Great puzzle game! If you like circuits, you will definitely enjoy this game :)"
909,2321,"Unique and fun puzzle game, which gets fiendishly difficult."
910,2321,"Very good game on logic, some sort of puzzler about chem's!"
911,2321,"This game makes me feel like I'm programming in assembly language but in 2D. Spatial assembler! If this sounds exciting, then try the demo and buy it! The best puzzle game I played in a very long time."
912,2321,This game is magic.
913,2321,DO YOU LIKE COMPUTER PROGRAMS AND MAKING  WORK?THEN THIS IS THE SCIENCE GAME FOR YOU.SET INSTRUCTIONS DOWNBOND THINGS TOGETHERDO SCIENCEMAKE CHEMICALSALL IN SPACE
914,2321,"Wow, finally, a really challenging puzzle game.  No, it's harder than that, but in a good way.  Interestingly enough, a background in computer science will go a long way to helping you get past the tough levels."
915,2321,"Very challenging puzzle game, keeps you thinking."
916,2321,"Possibly one of the most difficult puzzle games available.  This is sort of a robotic manufacturing game, where raw materials are disassembled, re-arranged and re-assembled using a handful of simple graphical commands on tracks.  This is the only game I'm aware of which has race conditions, just like what you find in real-life programming.I recommend it - go ahead and play the demo.  Even if it isn't your cup of tea, I tend to think you can overcome any feeling of ""this game makes me feel dumb"" if you approach it as an exploration: ""what happens if we try this?""  It takes a lot of persistence, knowing that every puzzle does have a solution.  But the payoff - especially for such a small price - is HUGE.  You'll learn to think in a more organized fashion by playing, I'm convinced of it."
917,2321,"Challenging puzzler, requires thinking in specific ways.SpaceChem starts you off very simple to ease you in to the basic way of things, but then quickly ramps things up. That learning curve may leave a lot of folks out in the cold, as I've found you need to learn specific techniques to complete the middle to later levels, and if you don't happen to think them up (or perhaps look them up) you might be left frustrated.If you enjoy puzzlers and difficulty I heartily recommend SpaceChem. Do come at it knowing that you may get stuck, but once you figure things out (or get a little help, perhaps) the satisfaction of beating a tough puzzle is well worth it."
918,2321,Makes you think a lot in optimizing the layout of your production facility. Overall very enjoyable.
919,2321,"Are you a programmer, chemical engineer, or autistic? Then this game is for you.If the screenshots and descriptions don't convince you that this is your type of game, then it isn't, because SpaceChem is not for the vast majority of people."
920,2321,"Great game for when you wanna think really really hard and give yourself a headache.The feeling you get when you finally solve the puzzle however, is F*****g AMAZING!."
921,2321,"The game is well-designed, but my reactors are not so much"
922,2321,preety cool game
923,2321,Nice mind bending puzzles. Feels like you are creating something not just solving a puzzle. Programmers will feel comfortable here if they love what they do.
924,2321,"This is a chemical puzzle game, with great story, and supports some languages!It's like constructing algorithm, and trying to make it simple.This difficulty maybe crazy, but really epic game! I recommend this."
925,2321,"Awesome and challenging game, great for puzzle lovers.  The puzzles are clever and original, you won't find anything else like it."
926,2320,Beautiful game concept. Nice complexity.
927,2320,"Quite simply, SpaceChem is the hardest puzzle game I've ever played by a wide margin. The object of the game is to use two pathways to assemble the atoms of elements in a grid from input to output, essentially programming a machine to create the desired output. This game is only for a certain type of person. If you're not prepared to have your brain explode, or you hate it when you can't get a puzzle right away, I don't recommend this game for you. It's really that hard. Solutions around mid-game will probably take you an hour or two. If you're not very inclined with logic and algorithms you may not like this game. However, even if any of these applied to you, I still think it's worth a buy, if only to experience the difficulty this game features, even so early on. If this kind of puzzler is your cup of tea, then do I have the game for you. Whenever you find a solution to a puzzle, the immense feeling of pride is overwhelming. As you're guiding the elements you'll actually feel like a scientist on a breakthrough project. When you do finally solve a puzzle after hours of planning, you'll want to make it more efficent and quicker than what you already have. You'll want to watch it work in front of you as you admire your handywork. If you enjoy working out difficult problems and like a programming-type style of puzzle then you are this game's audience."
928,2320,"SpaceChem is a game about fake chemestry and engineering. If you like challenging (very challenging) games where you push yourself against other people in using fewer moves and buttons to complete a task, this game is up your ally. This isnt a game you can play drunk while watching t.v. but more a game where you use all of your brain power to complete the task at hand. There is a wonderfull booklike story that goes with the game but the game itself is where its at. Would recommend 9.5/10, 100 hours and still havent completed the entire game. Could use an update on the graphics (no wide screen support)."
929,2320,my brain melted
930,2320,"Mostly a game for casual gamers. There is no stress, it's only puzzles. The first one are fairly easy, then it simply gets more complex fairly fast. The real challenge is ain't to complete the level, which can be pretty hard, but to actually do it with the best efficiency and/or the best time. And both one solution doesn't automatically means it's the best for the other critera."
931,2320,Great puzzle game with well thought out mechanics. Multiple ways of finishing puzzles plus leaderboards cause you to strive to make the most effecient reactor possible to complete the puzzle. Well worth its cheap pricetag.
932,2320,Great puzzle game. Simple but functional user interface.
933,2320,"Very enjoyable, can be tricky at times. Overall worth it. (Plus you get the fishcake :D )"
934,2320,"This is a quite challenging graphical programming puzzle game.  The levels can get quite complex, very quickly, and are solvable in a myriad of ways.  I'd recommend this if you are someone who is interested in programming puzzles or ""drive the robot"" style games."
935,2320,"One of the best puzzle games currently avaible on Steam. For that price, I'd highly recommend it."
936,2320,"I strongly reccomend this game for people who like puzzle games and don't mind being stuck on a level for some time in order to come to an ingenious solution. If you do not have the patience and the will to think for so long and prefer more action in a game, then I would say that you can better leave this game alone"
937,2320,Great puzzle game!
938,2320,Awesome puzzle game! Don't let the chemistry nature of it scare you. Watch the tutorial and play the first few levels. It's easy to pick up. There's a lot of depth to it. Very exillerating when you solve the puzzles. Highly recommend it. This is also available for android so you can also get it for your phone or tablet.
939,2320,"For $2.00, this purchase is a no-brainer. It's a hard puzzle game that will keep you rooted to your keyboard for hours trying to solve what look like simple puzzles but aren't. Just get it."
940,2320,"If you like puzzles and programming, this game is for you!  Cool way to learn a little about chemistry, but this really isn't chemistry so much as it is programming.   Very challenging!!"
941,2320,"SpaceChem is one of the best puzzle games I have played. It's open ended puzzles allow for nifty solutions while the limited space to work with creates very difficult, but very rewarding puzzles. I have spent more than 80 hours playing SpaceChem plus many more hours before I got it on steam.The only downside with the game is that it can be very difficult for newcommers to work out how the game works."
942,2320,"If you enjoy coding, math, or any kind of hard science, this game will consume your life. I spent WEEKS playing it when it came out, usually with a tab of graph paper and a pen. It presents you with challenge after challenge, and you'll have to be as efficient and creative as possible to complete them.If i could pick one game that i think would be a great thing to be literally addicted to; it's this one. It's almost an educational game (though not really about chemistry) in disguise, in that it forces you to think like an engineer."
943,2320,"Spacechem shouldn't be fun. But it is. It starts off relatively gently, easing you in to the different processes. But soon your head is close to exploding as you try to refine your factory designs just that little bit more, or try to avoid your pipes backing up and everything breaking. It is pure logic, and so you should know whether or not this is for you. If in doubt, give it a try - there is a ton of depth that belies the simple looking screenshots"
944,2320,"A lesser-known jem of a game, and one of the hardest (and unique) puzzle games I have ever known. Plus: Science!My Brain still hurts every time I launch this up. It is truly a masterpiece."
945,2319,"This does not teach me how to properly synthetize MDMA.Regardless of that, it's a fun game."
946,2319,Say goodbye to the rest of your life and hello to a life of SpaceChem
947,2319,"First off, this game is not chemistry.  Do not let the 'Chem' in 'SpaceChem' scare you off.  Second off, this game is an addictive programming puzzle game that uses the periodic table as a basis for its puzzles that has a steep learning curve and a brutal difficulty in the moderate to later levels.  It's an excellent game if you want a major mental challenge or simply wish to work on your spacial programming and optimization skills."
948,2319,"While playing this game, it felt as if I were working on an assembly level programming assignment than actually playing a puzzle game. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing if you're the type who has a love for problem solving, an intellectual challenge, or the like. But here's the thing (and you've probably read it before), the assignments are tough (boy, do they get tough fast) and more likely than not, you'll find yourself staring at the screen trying to imagine solutions inside your head for hours or days....or weeks. Therefore, I don't recommend the game to the impatient or casual gamer. I do recommend the game to puzzle enthusiasts and programmers.  Two more things:  1) you do not need a background in chemistry to play this and 2) download the demo if you're interested to see if this game is your cup of tea."
949,2319,Atomic engineering. It hurts my brain and I love it.
950,2318,This is not a regular game. This is a very niche game. I highly recommend it for anybody who likes to put their brain to the test and who has a lot of patience. Try the demo before purchasing.
951,2318,"Fun and addictive, nice to run on different platforms."
952,2318,"If you want to spend great deal of energy to think about programming like solutions but in different environment, try Spacechem. The best highscore system I've seen. Passing a level is very satisfying. Not the best UI but works good enough."
953,2318,"This is the hardest game I own, hands down. I'm not a programmer and I know many of the other comments say to not buy it unless you are. I still manage to enjoy it. It takes days to figure out some of the puzzles (for me) and lots of trial and error. When you finally manage to pull it off though, you feel great. This isn't one of those games you'll tromp through in a weekend and never come back to."
954,2318,"This game is awesome, but ever since I got a job as a programmer it feels too much like work."
955,2317,"I have no idea why it has 'casual' in genre, since this is one of the most hardcore puzzle games I`ve ever expierenced to play. And I did enjoy it. Zachtronics make really great logic games, and this one so far is their best. It will make you use logic and creative thinking to solve levels. And it feels really rewarding after you beat another hard level. I do reccommend this game to anyone who likes to face decent challenge. You can often read that this game requires programming skills. Well, it doesn`t, it will actually teach you thinking in a way programmers do, don`t miss that opportunity :)"
956,2317,Reminds me of procedural programming. Just more fun and no wasted tuition if you fail.
957,2317,"a good and original puzzle game based on chemistry, but you don't need to know chemistry to enjoy it.the difficultry ramps up steadily. at times it feels overwhelming. but there is a certain pleasure in figuring a solution out - and there is always more than one way. then at the end of a level you can see how you scored against everyone else and you feel tempted to improve on your solution.I can only recommend this game. It is satisfying, has an interesting story and is a really good timefiller!"
958,2317,"I liked this game a lot. First of all, programming games are very rare. This is not only a good programming game, but also a fun and challenging game. The idea is genius! The design and implementation is good. The story is interesting. Even the menus look good. The boss battles are a very cool idea too. It's just amazing to use the ""boring"" thing like chemical plants to fight enemies. The switches in boss levels made it feel like I was creating a game inside a game (building the ""engine"" and wiring the controls).Liked the additional levels and the online gallery.The not so good parts (there are very few):1) Liked the music, but there's like only a single track. I've spent countless hours and the music got to me a bit.2) Non-gameplay graphics (like the pyramid) are a bit low-res and blurry when viewed on a large monitor.3) I encountered a bug: sometimes when I opened some old completed level, the plant schemes were slightly messed up (any any change breaks everything for good). Guess the save format was a bit unstable. This disn't set me back while I was playing through the game, but I'm a bit of archivist.Overall, this is a great game. I want some more of it. Don't know what exactly do I want, dut I want more =)"
959,2317,"Great game! Really makes you think, I made a review on it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObpOTr58DKI"
960,2316,AL
961,2314,A game like this is on another level
962,2310,"Amazing and challenging puzzle game. It has one of the best dificulty curves I've seen. Every level increases the challenge greatly but never so much as to discourage the palyer. It egged me on the whole game through. Levels also have good replayability finding the most effective solution, which you can compare with the global score curve. If you enjoy tough as nails puzzles this is THE game to pick."
963,2309,"If you are into writing software, I think that this game will appeal to you.   Your skills at solving multithreaded programming problems will come in handy."
964,2308,"Looking at my playtime, I think it's an okay game."
965,2308,"This is easily the hardest puzzle game I've ever played, and I loved every second of it. I have about 30 hours played before I actually bought the game (sorry zachtronics! your game is awesome!), but going back through my solutions was just as fascinating as figuring them out in the first place. Finessing your reactions to get them as efficient as possible offers a lot of replayability, though I wish you could save solutions to levels separatley."
966,2307,A challenging brain teaser with programming roots!
967,2306,"Awesome puzzle game!  The tutorial could use a little work though, but once you get the hang of it this game will haunt your sleep."
968,2306,great game  nuff said buy demo and if you like buy game (it is cheaper on ios though)
969,2305,I got this game on a steam sale for $1.50. What a steal.This game was one of the best hidden gems I've found pretty much ever. The game is NOT easy but it rewards you for creativity and perseverance. It's such a huge feeling of satisfaction after you complete a one of the later puzzles and everything all works together in a beautiful machine of molecule building.
970,2305,"If Myst was a puzzle game for artists, and crossword puzzles are a puzzle game for linguists, SpaceChem is a puzzle game for programmers.Sometimes brutally difficult, the feeling of fist-in-the-air celebration when you hit upon a solution is unmatched elsewhere.You don't actually have to know any programming to play, but you might find after a few hours of SpaceChem that your old c++ textbook from college suddenly makes more sense to you.Always fun, never unfair, and fantastic brain exercise."
971,2305,"This is a great logic/puzzle game. You need to design a ""circuit board"" that breaks and creates atomic bonds to produce the desired element. as the game progresses, you need to have multiple ""circuit boards"" that feed into one another, to produce the desired elements. When designing the ""circuit boards"" you have to try and balance a number of moving parts, otherwise you encounter problems of atoms colliding into one another, or supply/delivery pipelines being filled so they cannot accept new deliveries."
972,2304,"SpaceChem is  brilliant. In the course of the game you use reactors to combine elements into molecules - that's pretty much the gist of it. However, it's done via timing mechanisms where you take in molecules and atoms and manipulate them via a series of steps - adding/removing bonds, fusing them, splitting them, teleporting them, the list just goes on. From an actual chemistry standpoint it doesn't make a hell of a lot of sense, but what's really intriguing is that this takes the essence of programming/circuit design and distills it into a fascinating game. Engineering students/programming students should CONSUME this game - it's a wonderful example of the sort of work we try to solve.I got hopelessly addicted to this game for a good long while. It gets hard - REALLY hard. But the feeling of satisfaction upon finding a solution is just....so fantastic. Even more if you've got some friends who you can compete against trying to find more and more efficient solutions.I cannot recommend this game enough. It's wonderful."
973,2304,"This game is one of the best i have ever played. Unfortunately i cannot play it any more, my mind spins with possible solutions for hours afterwards, keeping me from sleep. It is at heart a programming game, but disguised into chemistry machine building.  In fact you are building a network of mutlithreaded realtime processors. The programming aspect makes this into a ""sandbox"" pussle; you must fulfill the objectives, but there are an infinite amount of ways to do so. Afterwards you get a comparison with others that have played the level, and get to se how well you did versus them. The interesting part of that comparison is that it rates you on both processsing time and design simplicity, and in general you cannot do well in both. This will either leave you with a feeling of that you chose the right optimization or (as in my case) trigger competitive insanity. All in all: difficult and timeconsuming; requires concentration and effort. You might also learn something."
974,2304,"Flow puzzles were some of my favorite when I was younger, I don't know why.  I love the little games where you had a pipe of water coming out one side and you needed to channel it to the other side in the right amount of time, or via some complex complication where they shipped to many right bending pipes and not enough left bend pipes they've always been fun to me.This ends up being a little like that but taken to the extreme.  Labeled fake chemistry, you're tasked with assembling various molecules from their base elements including the number of bonds required to make the molecule.  The puzzlyness (new word!) is excellent.  Receiving two inputs on a reactor, you have you output your end goal.  Eventually, molecules are so complex that you'll need multiple sub combines in different reactors pumped into the other reactors in order to combine the final element.  There's 2 scales of assemble, one where goods are piped into and out of the reactors that to the combinations and then the actual assembly puzzles within the reactors themselves.  When you hit the go switch, the elements are pumped in at a fixed rate and everything must be processed and timed in order to get the right targets out the other end.Hard to explain, fantastic to play.  Easily in my top five of puzzle games of all time.  Hard to find something bad to say about this game apart from it not having much replayability apart from making your designs more efficient.  At the end of every round, you're presented with your cycles to completion and parts used count and are compared globally.  It makes you feel dumb at times and genius at others.  The lack of replay however becomes a bit of a non-issue because there are so many levels/puzzles.This is solid at the $15 level.  Many hours of fun here and a real joy to work through each puzzle.Visuals 6Gameplay 9Slant 8Overall : 76"
975,2304,"You know that feeling in school when there's something you just absolutely do not know what to do on a certain problem, but then all of a sudden there's that ""Ah ha!"" moment?  That's basically every single in this game.  Wonderful game!"
976,2302,"SpaceChem is a brilliant puzzle game in that when you get a solution to a puzzle, especially one of the later ones, the feeling of satisfaction is incredible. Watching your creation working as planned is a fantastic feeling.What I will say is that it is certainly not for everyone. It takes perseverance but, as I've said, it pays off."
977,2302,"Best chemistry-themed programming language ever!SpaceChem is by no means an easy game, but that doesn't stop its vibrant community here on Steam from logging tens or even hundreds of hours figuring out solutions to its puzzles and devising new, more fiendish ones of their own.Highly recommended for anyone with an interest in computer science or who has kids they want to keep busy."
978,2302,"Fun, and it's very satisfying when you get a puzzle working, but it makes me realize that I'm probably not cut out to be a programmer."
979,2302,Will give a good workout to  your grey matter.

981,2301,"Best puzzle game, i've ever played!"
982,2301,Programming meets chemistry meets space exploration meets giant alien battles.  There is literally nothing to not love about this game.
983,2300,"Heres a game I dont like, but actually feel bad about not liking.SpaceChem is a puzzle game in which you have to create chemical compounds inside reactors. To be more precise, your job is to create procedures that assemble those compounds - yes, assemble. Its not so much a game about chemistry as it is about creating factory lines, or concurrent programs.The concept behind the game is nothing short of brilliant, and I dont think theres a single game in the market remotely like it. I was taken by it in the first few hours. After that, however, the difficulty ramped up considerably, and I found myself taking way too long to figure out a single solution.Thats my problem with the game, its just too complicated for its own good. You have to spend massive amounts of time on details trying to make the solution work, and forget about the story because of how much time goes by between scenes. It ends up feeling like a job, not a diversion.Sometimes, I wish I could have gotten into it. I admire people who play this game well. In fact, I spent a lot of time at Spacechem.net trying out different solutions for levels, completely taken by how brilliant they were. But I saw no joy in trying to figure them out myself.I guess SpaceChem can be compared to EVE Online in this regard. Its a game thats really fun to watch unfold, but only the most patient and dedicated can actually play. If youre in that group, good, buy it, but if youre like me, skip it. Theres not much for you here."
984,2299,"Play this game if you are a programmer. I love it, but it's so hard."
985,2299,"Its just great how playing this game can make you feel smarter than usual. Just going back on old levels to see how you finished it.Its just like ""wow I did that?clever!""."
986,2297,"This game consumed my life... literally... for a couple months. To put this game into simple terms, SpaceChem is basically a visual programming game. You receive various inputs and using various tools within the game, the goal is to generate a specified output. Loops, if/then statements, arrays, and many more tools are at your disposal. The game starts simply, but the difficulty increases quickly. Pretty soon, you will find a puzzle that completely stumps you.This game is not for the feint of heart, the puzzles are hard. But since the game operates within a well defined set of rules, you will find yourself thinking of solutions throughout the day. I found myself drawing sketches to solutions that I had brainstormed while at work. Then I'd eagerly wait until the day was over to get home, try out the idea, and refine any issues. Like I said, the game consumes your life. But when you find yourself stumped on a puzzle for hours, only to conjure a solution during the day, and implement it to great success, you will feel an immense amount of accomplishment.Quite simply, this is one of the best puzzle games I have played. I wish there was more, I must have more. My only disclaimer is that if you don't like steeply difficult challenges, then you likely won't enjoy this game. I will say it once more, this game is hard."
987,2296,"A few years ago, a mother and father decided they needed a break, so they wanted to head out for a night on the town. They called their most trusted babysitter. When the babysitter arrived, the two children were already fast asleep in bed. So the babysitter just got to sit around and make sure everything was okay with the children. Later that night, the babysitter got bored and went to watch TV, but she couldn't watch it downstairs because they did not have cable downstairs (the parents didn't want children watching too much garbage). So, she called them and asked them if she could watch cable in the parent's room. Of course, the parents said it was OK, but the babysitter had one final request she asked if she could cover up the angel statue outside the bedroom window with a blanket or cloth, at the very least close the blinds, because it made her nervous. The phone line was silent for a moment, and the father who was talking to the babysitter at the time said, ""..Take the children and get out of the housewe will call the police. We do not have an angel statue."" The police found all three of the house occupants dead within ten minutes of the call. No statue was found."
988,2296,"I recently replayed the campaign of SpaceChem and it remains one of my all-time favourites. The simple mechanics which lure you in are expanded in consistent and interesting ways to create a wonderfully complicated yet approachable puzzle machine that will leave you tinkering for hours, trying to optimize your fabricators."
989,2296,I just wanted TF2 items what the  did i get myself into
990,2296,"A logic ""puzzle"", dozens ways to solve, optimize your solution. If u like maths or logic thinking, give it a try! It's about chemical elements, but u dont need to know much to play it!"
991,2296,awesome
992,2296,"Spacechem...not for the easily annoyed.  I think this qualifies as an IQ test.  After the intro puzzles, it gets harder as the molecule complexity increases.  Fun if you persevere."
993,2295,very dece
994,2295,This game is a great visual programming game! Starts with great tutorials to teach the concepts at a nice pace.
995,2295,"An absolutely fantastic game!  Comparing your solution to other players on three different levels is a very cool feature, and it challenges you to improve your own designs.  I love the chemistry theme (I am a Chemistry PhD candidate), and the game gets quite challenging later on (I love a good challenge).  Don't get this game if you're not a fan of challenging puzzles"
996,2295,This game will make you feel mentally retarded.
997,2295,It's not working on Mac OS X Snow Leopard at the moment. See the discussions for more. I have also found discussions about problems on OS X Lion and Mountain Lion. And also about the cloud synchronisation.I'll edit this review when it's working again.
998,2295,My brain hurts. That's a good thing.
999,2295,A good game! Need some programming skills to solve those puzzles.
1000,2295,"I've noticed that some of the reviewers have mentioned that this game is similar to programming and that you won't find it as fun if you're not a programmer. I dove into this game with no experience in programming and had an absolute blast with it. But then again, I ended up learning how to program eventually but that's not the point. You don't need any sort of background knowledge from programming or chemistry to enjoy this game but be aware that the puzzles can become mindblowingly convoluted yet incredibly satisfying when you manage to create a solution that works beautifully.I've started playing this game around three or so years ago and haven't finished the main storyline yet but I consider the ten bucks I've spent on this game so worth it for the time I've gotten out of it.Get the game, but be prepared for one hell of a challenge!"
1001,2295,"It's o hard, but so satisfying. apparently it's relatable to programming, so yeah, its also practical. You should get it."
1002,2295,awesome logic puzzle game!

1004,2294,Fishcake. Buy it on sale for the Fishcake.
1005,2294,"SpaceChem is a great puzzle game. The goal is to create a data flow based algorithm to transform one or more atoms/molecules into different atoms/molecules. But you need no knowledge about algorithms, mathematics or programming, its fairly simple and some trial and error is (at least for me) mostly more useful than thinking ahead too much ;)The learning curve is quite nice, and the replayability is great due to online leaderboards for the fastest or most efficient algorithms. And you can download unlimited user created puzzles.Ive bought this game for PC and on my iPad, and can recommend it for anyone who loves puzzles, or algorithms."
1006,2294,"Puzzle solving that reminds me of the time when I actually knew how to write computer code.The stlye is VERY step by step creating a proper setup (algorithm) to create the chemicles needed. Don't worry no chemistry knowledge is required. At one point I was hopping that this game could be a chemistry teacher, yeah ... it's not."
1007,2294,trying to trick me into learning chemistry
1008,2294,"SpaceChem is a very entertaining, mindbending challenge that manages to retain an approachable difficulty curve while the leaderboard system encourages you to to think deeply about the puzzle mechanics to out class your friends. The depth available to the game has spawned a community that has still not managed to perfect solutions for every level leaving plenty of room for the enterprising chemist to dazzle and impress. In short, if you're looking for a puzzle - this is the game to get. It's fun from the start and only gets better.Do not buy this game if you can't program. Turing completeness makes for some of the most engaging puzzling we will probably ever see in a video game, but it also unfortunately means that I cannot in good faith recommend this title without that massive caveat. The game makes no pretenses about its true nature and the introductory challenges are little more than cues to familiarize yourself with the game's controls and the puzzle mechanics. The experience with the demo version is only a portion of what the game has to offer: a lack of confidence in tackling the game's challenges will frustrate you and copying other people's solutions will leave you with no understanding or appreciation of the game."
1009,2294,"This is the kind of puzzler that lasts a while, and I haven't even really delved into the research.net stuff.  Half the fun is figuring out how to solve the puzzle.The other half is trying to figure out how to optimize it for symbols or length of time.I also love that I can see where I stand compared to others.  However, the numerical view is a bit confusing.  I can't tell if the number with the ) is my place or not.  I'll see something like 1) 486 on a puzzle, but if I look in graph view, I clearly am not the #1 solution.Still, I would highly recommend this game if you like puzzlers and don't mind challenging ones."
1010,2294,"This is a great puzzle game. The difficulty really ramps up by the end. Even when you think you have a great solution, someone has done it faster than you.Recommend for everyone who like a challenge."
1011,2294,"One of the best puzzle games I've ever played. I bought this game for like 10 people just because I can't recommend it enough. If you like to program, especially, the game feels a little like programming. Go buy it now because it's cheap."
1012,2293,Review written after almost completing the game.  It is a masterpiece. You will learn a bit about concurrent programming (but don't worry the game is fun and forgiving compared to the real world job).  Added: Later Zachtronic games are better but this is still the masterwork that started it all.
1013,2293,"I cannot say how awesome this game is. Seriously. Of course, it is very complicated and looks very complicated, but once you solve a level it is extremely rewarding."
1014,2293,One of the best puzzle games I have played - addicting!
1015,2293,"This game is ablsoutely fantastic if you like hard puzzlers, but be warned, this game gets hard. also, if you have any knowledge of how chemistry works, ignore it for this game because otherwise the mechanics will drive you crazy."
1016,2293,"Tired of similar games genres (FPS, RPG and etc.) constantly coming out? You want something challenging and fresh? You play best with your brains and not your mouse and/or skill? You're not fast but very smart? Like insanely hard puzzles? Then buy this.I'd say this one is the best and the hardest puzzle game I've played in my life."
1017,2293,"SpaceChem is a puzzler that places the player in the role of a scientist or engineer that must configure molecule assemble line. The game challenges the player to come up with the most elegant solution (using the least amount of resources). Being an IT engineer, when I first watched the tutorial video, admittedly I thought in my head ""oh great, this is going to be like my job"" and while the gameplay does remind me a little bit like writing code, it was actually surprisingly fun. The game's overall presentation is nice, somewhat simple but it's tastefully done. The music is good, although at times it made feel like I'm watching a movie from the 90s. The pacing of the game is well done; the player is sanely and graciously introduced to game elements. The game's design allows for any number of solutions and after solving a problem the player is presented with a bell curve as to how they compared to ""other engineers"" (ie players). I really appreciated this aspect as it let me know that a more efficent and elegant solution is possible. My only complaint with the game is that it actually did feel a bit like my job (but in a good way). The feeling of satisfation I got from completing a puzzle was similiar to the satisfaction I get when writing a piece of code I'm proud of at work. It's a good feeling but by the end of the day I'm usually more keen on relaxation instead of solving complex problems.Overall this game is nicely designed and definitely worth consideration. This game engages the mind and respects the player with interesting and challenging puzzles. The world needs more games like this.Score: 8.5/10"
1018,2293,"I think it may be the most fun puzzle game out there. Be aware that this is not a normal puzzle game as this needs a serious logic background to beat most of the levels.if you like computer programming and chemistry, you will like this game."
1019,2291,"My favourite puzzle game. The puzzles get gradually harder and harder, but never seem too impossible. I've never had this much drive to force myself in to solving a puzzle and never felt as rewarded when I finally did. The best part is; the solution is most likely unique.The game offers countless of ways to solve a puzzle and teaches the basic concepts behind programming while doing it. There is no right way to solve a puzzle, there are faster ways, simpler ways, more understandble ways and your way. I recommend every teacher teaching basic programming to show this game to their students as a way of understanding the principle behind programming, not just the language."
1020,2291,A cool visual programming puzzle game that requires more and more thought as you progress from simple to advanced designs.
1021,2291,This game will eat time in a good way there are no right answers to the questions. There more ways to win each level. So be ready to have your thinking hats on.
1022,2291,"If you into engineering or programming, this is the game for you! Very addicting gameplay and puzzles for the tech savvy; pretty educational as well as it deals with inputs, outputs, and multi-threading.My only gripe is that the puzzles get a little too difficult- even halfway though the story. This is definitely not a game for those not interested in mental puzzles.All in all I definitely recommend this game to those who have an interest\studying computer science or electrical engineering!"
1023,2291,A fun puzzle game.
1024,2291," Terrible!PuzzlesFrom the start, this game disappointed. Entering a DRM key with extremely tiny letters into a text field with no arrow key support (you can't go back and change a letter if you get one wrong, you have to delete everything and start over) is not a good way to start a fun game. Eventually I got it working, and I soon wished I hadn't.In a nutshell, this game is too simple in the action department, and too complex in the how-to-play department. I'll admit, I enjoy a good action game, but if a puzzler is done right, I can waste plenty of hours on it. This game, however, was just too boring. I didn't care who the hero was, I didn't care why he needed to move circles (molecules) around, the game just did not motivate me to move past the first few levels.Basically, if you like dragging and dropping shapes onto other shapes, you'll like this game. And if that's the case, there's a little game with differently shaped pegs that you have to put into similarly shaped holes that you might like too."
1025,2291,"Devious, Inteliigent. No game has ever recreated the rollercoaster of feelings after beating a puzzle as this game.""This is impossible"", ""Aha, i see it now, its all so simple"", ""I AM A GOD OF GAMING"" ""On to the next level, Wait, this is impossible."""
1026,2290,"I've mainly played this game on the iPad, but I wanted to express my love for this title here as well.  It is a well crafted puzzle game that encourages creativity in its solutions.In this game, there is a grid.  On this grid, you will place molecules, you will move molecules, and you will export specific, predetermined molecules.  The catch is, you have to do so by constructing a machine in advance, and then let it solve the problem for you.  Making such a machine is not easy, and it is rare that it will work as expected the first time.  The ""machine"" as I described it is composed of two tracks, with instructions along them.  A disc, which the game calls a WALDO, travels along each track, following the instructions as it comes across them.  The instructions include making an input molecule appear, making an output molecule disappear, grabbing/dropping a molecule, and bonding two molecules together.There are many ways to beat each level.  Some are more efficient than others.  The great thing about this is that it encourages you to replay old levels to try to find the most optimized way of beating them.  You get to compare the efficiency of your solutions to the solutions of others.  This is probably the hardest puzzle game I've ever played (I still haven't beaten it, even on the iPad), but it is definitely the most satisfying.  There's a real joy when your contraption finally comes together and works as planned.  And the challenge is such that it ultimately feels fair.  There's always a ""best"" way to do it, but whatever you can come up with, so long as it gets the job done, is acceptable.If you want a challenging, well made game that encourages creative solutions to puzzles, then look no further than this game."
1027,2290,Gorgeous puzzle game. Great way to keep your brain rust.
1028,2290,"An extremely challenging but very rewarding puzzle game. Core gameplay revolves around using commands to direct the actions of two machines and have them move around and bond elements into various molecules. The difficulty comes from utilizing the limited space you have in the most efficient way possible. The difficulty in this game will make you want to throw your monitor at a wall at times, but it's extremely satisfying when you figure out a solution and watch the little bits fly around the screen as you wait for it to finish. Definitely a must buy if you're patient and looking for a great puzzle game."
1029,2290,this game makes me feel as stupid as i probably am.
1030,2290,"I'm not smart enough to get very far in this game.With that said, I think its fun, challenging, and I've bought for friends that I think would do well in it.If you're into programming, buy this game.If you're not into programming, skip it."
1031,2290,"SpaceChem has the most marvelously difficult puzzles where you don't so much find a solution as build it. The difficulty rises steeply, and you may yourself stumped, only to wake up in the middle of the night thinking ""Eureka! I've got it!"" (true story.) And once the atoms and molecules are whizzing around, doing their perfectly orchestrated dance that you yourself choreographed, you feel a wonderful sense of ownership of the solution, since it is in a very real sense yours.No knowledge of chemistry required, though people with programming experience may have an edge."
1032,2290,"My exact reaction to playing this awesome game:First seeing it: ""This looks like an interesting game that'll make me have to think""First playing it: ""The tutorial wasn't too difficult""After a few levels: ""That last one was pretty challenging. *starts next level* I have no idea what I am doing. *exits to map*How far is it until the Moustachium levels?   (So what if I only got it for the TF2 items)   (I'm still playing until I beat it)*looks it up*They're on the main menu. *facepalm*#602: ""That was really easy""#604: ""That took a while. I probably made it more complicated than it needed to be.""#608: ""WHAT THE FFFUUUUUUUU-""*ragequit*""I wonder how I was supposed to do the ones I already beat.""After first Youtube video: ""YOU CAN DO THAT!?!?!CURRENT PROGRESS: Atropos Station"
1033,2290,"It's like molecular programming.  This is one of the most thoughtful puzzle games I've ever played.  A relaxing soundtrack, streamlined interface and the ability to play windowed are just icing on the cake.  Compete with the community for space or speed efficiency with your builds.The game is difficult to explain.  Essentially you are tasked with building reactors that combine atoms from the periodic chart into molecules that are shipped away.  You have various tools at your disposal to combine, split and fuse atoms and molecules.  The solutions vary greatly from task to task and the difficulty ramps up quickly."
1034,2289,Amazing puzzle!
1035,2289,"I ususally dislike puzzle games, but the basics SpaceChem are so intuitive that I can easily start thinking even on the hardest problems. Creating a solution gives me the same excitement as beating a hard enemy in an action game. Highly addictive."
1036,2288,good challenging puzzlesgreat plot9/10
1037,2288,"Are you a fan of hard-core puzzle games? Do you enjoy pondering a problem until smoke trickles out your ears and your brain begins to turn to mush? Have you ever met a problem you just can't resist shooting? What if you don't have a gun?Look no further than SpaceChem for your next puzzler. I promise you that this game has stumped and infuriated me more than any other puzzle game I've played; And I've played my fair share.You hard-core '90s gamers may call me a whimp but give it a shot and see how far you can get.SpaceChem has an awesome campaign with a pretty good story to match.  In addition to the campaign, you can also create your own puzzles and play those created by others. All-in-all it makes for many hours of puzzler goodness. Certainly a must-play!"
1038,2285,you should buy this game if you regularly feel too intelligent
1039,2285,
1040,2284,"Great game, but clearly not for everyone (just take a look at the complaints in the forums). While it is a puzzle game, it is nothing like the popular puzzle games out now (e.g. bejeweled and its many clones). The game looks like it should appeal to Chemists, but the people that seem to enjoy and do well in this game are typically software/electrical engineers, computer scientists, mathematicians, and the like. The underlying link seems to be an understanding of programing logic to some extent. (I'm sure there are people that play and enjoy the game that haven't had a lick of programming experience, but I haven't seen many.) Indeed, the chemistry mechanic of the game is secondary and extremely questionable in terms of the reality of it. While I really enjoy this game, there is a *sharp* learning curve. The tutorials can only teach you so much. This again reminds me of computer programing: you can know the basics, but that does not prepare you for the mental exercise of working out a complex challenge. That being said, there are few games that have given me the feeling of accomplishment and pride when I finally work out a solution."
1041,2281,The most incredible  nerd game!
1042,2280,Very clever and challenging. Makes you feel like a genius when you figure things out and it's semi-educational.
1043,2280,Very cool puzzler. Will make your brain hurt.
1044,2276,"This game is unforgiving, because it requires you to solve harder and harder puzzles to unlock the next ones, and doesn't have any sort of 'hint system', nor a way of skipping puzzles.This game is probably only for niche audiences, namely hardcore puzzle lovers or people who find programming so enjoyable, they'll even do it in their spare time.This game's story is hard to digest, because it is only available in text form and progresses very slowly as you take more and more time to solve the increasingly difficult puzzles.But honestly, I just freaking love it. From the fake chemistry of fusing atoms together in strange constellations that would not work in real life, to the story involving otherworldly beings threatening a far future version of an ever expanding human society. And of course, the hardcore puzzles, the programming and even the alchemy references, considering the predecessor to this game. These strengths are more than enough for me to forgive each and every flaw this game ever had.""From the creator of The Codex of Alchemical Engineering"" - 'nuff said"
1045,2274,One of my favorite puzzle games. Every single level can be played multiple times in order to get the best possible solution in multiple categories. This gives lots of opportunity to practice and optimize solutions.
1046,2273,"Perfect game for those who like incredibly tough and complex puzzle games. Make no mistake, this game has very little to do with actual chemistry - aside from the names of the atoms and molecules, as well as some basic concepts like bonds, this is MUCH more of a puzzler than any kind of chemical engineering guide. Nobody builds molecules one by one - unless they play this game.Also, amazing music. The OST is worth purchasing."
1047,2273,One of the best puzzle games I have ever played. Well worth a look if you like that sort of game.
1048,2272,"This has been one of the best puzzle games I have played in awhile.It is challenging, has a new and well thought out play style and is just all around fantastic!"
1049,2272,By far one of the best and most challenging puzzle game I saw during the last few years!
1050,2271,"In spacechem you don't look for the sollution to a puzzle, you design one. And it will keep you coming back to improve on your earlier designs."
1051,2271,Brilliant puzzle game that has a good depth and variety.
1052,2271,Great game for learning the periodic table.
1053,2271,"Possibly the finest pure-brainpower puzzler I've ever played. You have all the time in the world to create a solution to each assignment, and the complete freedom of design means that there's never one ""correct"" solution - build something quick and dirty to get the job done, design a wonderfully ""elegant"" solution, or optimise to your heart's content for speed or efficiency."
1054,2271,Wonderfull combination of a puzzeler and design game. Reminds me of my passion for programming sometimes :)
1055,2271,All the fun of chemistry and puzzle games put together for your bewilderment. Doesn't require any knowledge about how chemistry works. Will still make you go insane. In case it's not clear I love spacechem and you should too.
1056,2270,"Now, this is a unique game that will require some brains! But it let's you do experiments and tiny steps while solving a puzzle. I've not come across another game that is like SpaceChem."
1057,2269,"One of the more challenging puzzle games you'll ever come across, it's also exceptionally unique.  Puzzles take on a progromatic approach to assembling molecules out of atoms, with ever increasing complexity.  Genuinely satisfying."
1058,2269,Building your own reactors? Pure fun! Extraordinary puzzles involwed ^.^
1059,2267,"A rather unique logic game with a fun, comic book flavor."
1060,2267,"There isn't much here in the way of action, but if you enjoy noodling your way through puzzles then you are likely to appreciate this wonderful little gem.  Simple concept.  Clean execution.  You can go for speed.  You can go for minimalism.  And you can spend hours refining your solutions to  elegance.  Very cool game.  One of my all-time favorites [Still]."
1061,2266,"A fun puzzle game, great for people who like science! Not an easy game, but once you get the grasp of it, you will be set to beat the game. A must-have."

1065,2264,"It's kind of like programming but without all the tediousness.  At least, it gives the same sort of satisfaction obtatined via programming.  It gets incredibly difficult, however."

1074,2257,"This is probably the best puzzle game that I have ever played.  It's almost tipping over in to a programming game, so bear that in mind, but I like programming games."
1075,2255,"The quckest and easiest way to both understand the challenges of programing, and make your brain leak out of your ears."
1076,2254,This is the best puzzle game that has ever been created.
1077,2254,I hate this game.  Its not fun and I'm never going to play it again.  Its stupid.  Its a horrible puzzle game thats like crack without the payoff.  As a matter of fact I'm going to go delete it now.  SWEET just finished a level.  Oh the euphoria!   Maybe I'll play for a few more hours.
1078,2254,"The definite reference for puzzle games. Also, for molecular chemistry, of course."
1079,2253,"Solutions hide in the ebb and flowOf the chemical tide with patterns set;Chemists of deep space shall knowThat I speak of inputs net.And how reactors spring from mindConnected by little silver cordsThrough assignments most unkind. ...buy this game; no further words.- ZK, with a little help from W. B. Yeats"
1080,2253,"Best. Puzzle. Game. Ever.No hyperbole here, a simple and undeniable statement. What sets it apart from other games in the genre is that the puzzles are both challenging and openended, hell keeping track of the pipeline you've just built is a challenge in itself. Play it ASAP if you haven't already."
1081,2252,"It's like Where's Waldo but with chemicals.Okay, maybe not. It's a fiendish and quite unique puzzle game that has you manipulating atoms and assembling molecules inside special reactors. The process of engineering the assembly lines, however, resembles the usage of a visual programming language. A friend of mine said that if you have any spark of a programmer inside of you, you will love this game. I agree with him. The 'language' that the Spacechem reactors use may be somewhat limited, but that's what forms much of the challenge of the game.And I mean it when I say it's fiendish. The tutorials are more akin to guidelines, and they don't tell you some of the tricks you will probably end up needing, meaning that self-discovery plays a fairly large role. Fortunately enough, the solutions are open-ended - seeing your solution work provides much of the satisfaction of the game. That's why if you get stuck (and you will probably get stuck a fair amount), it's best to find hints, go back to earlier levels to try and find inspiration from them or simply take a break.Anyway. Surprisingly for a puzzle game, it has a pretty good story, killer music and Team Fortress 2 promotional items. You'll need to use TF2's advanced crafting to make them, and you need to solve three puzzles to gain all the crafting ingredients you need. It's a pretty remarkable implementation, perhaps one of the most remarkable out of all of TF2's promos."
1082,2252,"You beat each level by designing a machine to beat it for you.Pros:A clever educational game, and probably one of the most challenging puzzle games ever made. Solving the puzzles requires a mixture of computer programming, creativity, and chemistry. You don't require a knowledge of either subject since the game will teach you what you need to know. Great for students interested in learning about either subject.If you want to show off how clever you are, this is the game for you.Cons:The puzzles can be so challenging that playing the game - at times - feels like work. This isn't a relaxing activity. It requires a lot of concentration and focus. Although I like the game very much, it's hard to find a time when I have the energy to play it."
1083,2252,One of the most unique puzzle games I've ever played!
1084,2252,"SpaceChem is a magnificent game that is reminiscent of Portal. It has a scientific setting, a quirky personality and some of the most intense mind-racking puzzles. You  combine atoms and such using a trainyard rail-style medium. You will develop chemistry with this game. It will trick you to thinking that you performed real science. And when you solve these missions on your own, it will be euphoric."
1085,2251,To anyone that fancies themselves a logician or a programmer - this game is BRILLIANT!I cannot begin to describe the brilliant ways it  with your head. Get it immediately!!!
1086,2250,I cannot recommend this game enough. Unique puzzles and an engaging story behind them. The learning curve is a bit steep but the levels are designed to help you build on what you've already figured out to get to solve the next major hurdle.
1087,2249,"SpaceChem is a masterpiece. The challenge here is to create specific chemical compounds by rearranging the atomic structure of the given compound(s) and delivering them to the destination through a pipes. You accomplish this using a series of reactors which can add, remove or re-arrange the atoms of a compound: each of these is a puzzle in and of itself. Deciding how many and which type of reactor to use in each level provides a sort of macro puzzle. Many levels limit the type and/or number or reactors available, providing variety in addition to aesthetic and compound differences. You can save and load reactor layouts, allowing you to use them in different levels.Each level is so brilliantly complex in that you are not only trying to construct the most efficient way to modify the compounds within each reactor, you must also consider the overall purpose of each reactor in sequence: given that most compounds require several different reactors to change them into the desired result. Additionally (yes, there is more: bear with me, it will be worth it!), each level must be completed within a certain time frame or 'cycles'. Transporting each compound from the start to the destination takes time, as does modifying them through each reactor. If not designed efficiently, you may end up with bottlenecks in your chain of reactors, leading to the overall level time being too slow. This is usually fixed through some minor tweaking and provides another level of strategic planning to the each levels.I found the muisic to be quite enjoyable and the astheic both functional and pleasing to look at. There is an overacrching story, which is told between levels. It is very well written, and quite interesting. I fear however, that I will never see the end of the story, due to my own incompetence and to the sheer complexity and intricacy of the puzzles."
1088,2247,"179 hours spent beating the game... and enjoying them, this deserves my first recommendation on steam beware: only if you like puzzles and dont mind spending hours / days to find the solution for one level and then spend as much time optimizing the solution to something beautifully efficient"
1089,2245,Great minigame.Difficult 'puzzles' via try and error.
1090,2244,"I had a lot of fun with this programming-based puzzle game.  The base mechanics are simple to learn, but it's set up such that later missions require real planning and work to pull off, let alone to optimize solutions."
1091,2244,For nerdy programming people who used to love chemistry in high school. If only my chemistry homework could have been that addictive back then!
1092,2244,"10/10This game has it all - brilliant design, fantasy science (more like space alchemy), a science fiction episodic story and absolutely brutal difficulty. If you love puzzles, you're in for a treat. Some of the later levels will set your brain on fire, easily taking an hour each (my total playing time is inaccurate).There are also many, many possible solutions to every problem, so you can really work things your own way. If you complete a difficult mission and check out other solutions on youtube, you might find there was a way to solve it 5x more efficiently, and it will blow you away. Note that the mechanics rely on loops, so you're essentially programming an assembly line.Last but not least, the music is great, which is good because you'll be listening to it a lot."
1093,2243,At normal I don't play puzzle games but this one is really fun. Awful graphics but a real headnut.
1094,2242,"This is simply the best puzzle game I have ever played. No chemistry knowledge required, but it is the type of game that you will walk away from, only to come back days later and beat a stage. DAT FEEL."
1095,2242,"Getting an headache has never been so much fun. SpaceChem is a puzzle game where you lay down a path for two ""Waldo""s (cursors) to make modifications to atoms and molecules. These two Waldos can activate commands like grab/drop, add/remove bond, rotate, input/output ect. The game starts simple, but gets more challenging over time, but never overwhelms you. The power of this game is the complexity while it only uses these simple commands, testing your creativity and making solving puzzles oh so rewarding. And with the provided level-editor and active community, you have access for a near-infinite amount challenging puzzles. Buy SpaceChem if you like puzzles and the rewarding feeling of solving them."
1096,2241,"Absolutely brilliant and innovative puzzler.  Yes, this game can invade your thoughts.  Sometimes I'll scribble the puzzle on my notepad and think about how to solve it during the day.  Then I go home, implement the solution, then find out why it doesn't work!  Need your thinking cap for this one, particularly to get some of the achievements.  Sometimes I go back to old puzzles to better my stats when I discover new ""tricks"" and strategies. Steam Leaderboard is icing on the cake.  So get this and try to beat my ""scores"".  Let me know if you do, and I may go back and beat you!!!  I still can't figure out how Luke did one particular puzzle in 200 cycles.  I'm stuck on 228!  (This is the type of thought that will invade your sleep!) ;)"
1097,2241,8/10 - Think-sponge likey.
1098,2241,"Fiendish puzzler involving manufacturing chemicals by linking together atoms to create one molecule at a time.  This game is essentially an excercise in programming process flow with logical functions.  At its best it makes you feel smart, at its worst you're stuck for hours with no progress feeling very dumb, certainly a game you have to work at for your rewards."
1099,2240,"Hands down, this is one of the best puzzle games I've ever had the pleasure of playing. It may seem intimidating, but you don't need to know anything about chemistry to play. It almost reminds me of those exercises where your partner is blind-folded in an obstacle course and relies on your instructions to manoeuvre through it and manipulate objects, only instead, your telling a teeny-tiny machine what to do with atoms. It really is worth checking out if you really like puzzle games that allow creativity with multiple solutions and make you think."

1102,2238,"If you are a programmer, SpaceChem will sit in the part of your brain that likes solving little puzzles and lay happiness eggs there."
1103,2237,"Excellent science puzzler, but bloody difficult! Finding a solution though is SO satisfying."
1104,2235,One of the best puzzles ever!
1105,2235,"Such a ingenious puzzle game. Although later levels are extremely hard, it has many quite solvable but challenging levels till then."
1106,2234,"A challenging puzzle game that always has you thinking ""I bet I can do that even better!"" Some of the levels are quite difficult, but there isn't just one right way to do things, so a mix of creativity and patience can lead to deep satisfaction. A brilliant thinker."
1107,2232,Maybe my interest in chemistry would have been greater if this little gem had been out back then in school ? Highly doubt it but that doesnt change the fact that this brainpicking puzzler is an instant win for everyone who enjoys some good time off the mainstream.
1108,2231,Best. Puzzler. Ever.
1109,2230,"Highly addictive puzzle game, highly recommended for engineer-type gamers!"
1110,2230,"Very clever and challenging puzzle game, I reccomend it to anyone who likes puzzles."
1111,2228,This game is a challenge and will make you think! It has a great soundtrack too.
1112,2228,This game is a unique and fascinating puzzle based loosely on organic chemistry.  Your goal in each level is to produce a specific chemical compound from the given inputs using logical steps to disassemble and reasemble as needed.  I have both the steam version and the iPad version and love them both.  Highly reccomended.
1113,2227,Very challenging and very rewarding.
1114,2226,"After nearly 100 hours, it's pretty safe to say I've never played another puzzle game as addictive as this one. I rarely get stuck on a puzzle, yet the puzzles are anything but easy, and the feeling of accomplishment I get when I finish one is unparalleled."
1115,2226,"C'est un super jeu de rflexion, simpliste par les graphismes mais incroyablement difficile. Un brain killer en force !"
1116,2226,A challenging puzzler that'll keep you up all night!
1117,2226,"Amazing brainteaser, that'll make you think of solutions even when your out of the game. Very freeform and very satisfying when you get a solution or optimize it. Has a very good learning curve in the campaing and some great community made challenges too. Highly recommend."
1118,2225,supa awsm molecule game get it or die+tf2 items
1119,2225,"SpaceChem is an absolutely brilliant and unique puzzle game.  Nothing else short of possibly Deadly Rooms of Death can compare to its depth of play while still retaining its simple foundations.SpaceChem is also dastardly tricky.  Most everyone else I know who's played it had to stop because it just got too difficult.  For some levels, I can understand that feeling.  The difficulty curve has spikes in it.  In the end though, I think it's definitely worth it.  The feeling of accomplishment you get is not just from beating the puzzles, but from your own personal solution to them.  You made this design that completed the task set in front of you.  It's yours, every single part of it.There are very few games that can evoke that sort of deeply personal satisfaction.  Of not a job well done, but a machine well made."
1120,2225,Wonderfully excellent puzzler. Requires helluvalotta thinking!
1121,2225,tricky stuff
1122,2225,excellent game
1123,2224,  !  . 10/10 ObsidianNews.
1124,2224,"WOW! If you like challenging puzzles, especially involving thread synchronization, optimal paths and most efficient utilization of resources, you're going to LOVE this game!"
1125,2224,One of the (if not the) best puzzle game I have ever played!
1126,2224,"This is not your normal puzzle game, its a hard nut to crack, but a fun and rewarding one with every puzzle you solve."
1127,2224,
1128,2224,"Terrible game. Not really a game though. More like you make a schematic based on 4 grids that are 4x4. You grab molocules, drop them, bond them, rotate them to match what your inputs and outputs supposed to be to complete the level. This is not a fun game. A lot of staring at a black screen with red lines and blue lines. Youtube this. I bought it for theTF2 items and got the heck out. Never playing this again."
1129,2224,"damn hard, but makes you feel so smart"
1130,2224,Great game; challenges your creativity.
1131,2222,"One of the best puzzle games out there. Hell, one of the best games, period. Seriously, buy this game!!"
1132,2222,Neat cerebral puzzler.
1133,2221, 
1134,2221,"Fantastic puzzle game that will challenge you at every turn. This game is not for those with tiny minds, you need to think of more and more complex systems to complete the puzzles, and it comes along with a story to tell you why you are doing the puzzles. Also, the game is fairly cheap, so I highly recommend buying it in any case."
1135,2220,"If you want a game to make you feel like a complete moron, buy SpaceChem.If you want a game to make you feel like an utter genius, buy SpaceChem."
1136,2220,Simply one of the best puzzle games I have ever played.
1137,2220,The puzzle game so awesome it doesn't seem like a puzzle game.
1138,2220,Brilliantly designed. Get it.
1139,2220,"Basically computer programming in a nutshell. Not that there is any actual programming involved, but this is very similar to what you would do if you were to actually program. Gets pretty difficult pretty quickly, but while the fun lasts, it is a pretty good game. (As can be guessed, same can be said for programming in my opinion.)Now excuse me while I go cool off my CPU... (Cerebral Processing Unit)"
1140,2220,"fantastic ocd systems efficientising game for programmers and other types of nerd from the creator of minecraft, buy it so that when people look at your steam games they will know you are smarter than them."
1141,2220,Great puzzle game!You can't miss it if you like puzzles.
1142,2219,"Probably one of the best puzzle games I've every played.  Worth every penny.  Provides many hours of gameplay, and is very challenging.  Maybe TOO challenging for most.  Steep learning curve, but satisfying when you finish.  Gets very difficult about a third of the way through.  It also happens to be one of the easiest games the company has made, which tells a lot about the company.  If you want to try it out a bit before, play the demo or play one of the company's other free games on the internet:  The Codex of Alchemical Engineering."
1143,2219,"If you like solving puzzles, especially ones that involve timing, you should enjoy SpaceChem.  And the online community part of the game adds tons of reply value."
1144,2219,"Rtseln ohne Ende. Komplex reinzukommen, aber macht sehr viel Spa."
1145,2219,Actually a new and unique puzzle game with a simple interface and complex results.
1146,2219,A really really nice puzzle....sometimes very brain challenging. One of my favorite puzzle game
1147,2219,"This game doesn't have striking visuals or a compelling story; however, it has the best puzzles of any puzzle game I've played BY FAR.  This game is truly challenging, yet never frustrating.  The puzzles are difficult yet fair. Trial-and-error by itself will get you nowhere; this game actually requires you to think, and challenges you to improve your solutions."
1148,2219,"I debated picking this game up because it looked a bit simplistic.  I was completely wrong with that assumption.  Sure, stylistically it is pretty basic, but the puzzles in this game are so well designed it's almost frustrating!  After just a few really simple ones to get your feet wet, the puzzles quickly get complex and require a great deal of planning.  You would think breaking apart molecules and using the atoms to create new ones would not be so challenging, but it really is given your limited resources.There are a few interface issues I wish were a little smoother, but since you can completely control how fast the game moves, it's not a big deal.  You'll be too busy trying to figure out how to break off 4 atoms and combine 3 others to create two separate outputs with just 4 bond zones to care about it.SpaceChem is pretty much the ultimate mind teaser  for spacial awareness.  It's a lot of fun for a low price.  Do yourself a favor and pick it up!"
1149,2219,Really hard but really addicting!
1150,2219,"Genuinly amazing game. Anyone who likes complex puzzles will love it, its a cross between chemistry, computing & production lines. go get it."
1151,2219,This is a chem nerd's game.  It includes a periodic table.  If you can wrap your head around it you'll have some fun.
1152,2219,"Whereas Portal and its sequel are fairly easy puzzle games that excel at making you feel smart.  SpaceChem is a quite challenging puzzle game that makes your head hurt.  But it gets to that point slowly.  It starts out very much like the Portals, introducing complexity in a piecemeal fashion and making you feel very smart as you resolve the earlier levels.  But it doesn't stop there.  It just keeps getting harder.  Fortunately, the sense of satisfaction scales well with the difficulty and makes for a wonderful and entertaining challenge."
1153,2219,Awesome puzzles and no hand-holding. Great game
1154,2219,Solve puzzles...WITH SCIENCE.
1155,2219,Lots of fun for the spatially-oriented.
1156,2219,Very cool puzzle game.
1157,2219,"This game is what great games are all about.  It has simple mechanics that lead to complex problem solving.  The game uses a simple mechanic called a Waldo.  It moves atoms.  You to tell it when to grab, drop, rotate or bond an atom.  That's about it.  Yet once you are into the game you are turning sea water and air into complex compounds.  You are filtering dirty water to power nuclear weapons.  While you are doing it you are also learning the fundamentals of modern programming and Chemistry.  It is one of those rare gems that will engage parts of your brain that you have probably forgotten exist, and at the same time leave you feeling immensely proud of your own creativity.  It is not flash.  It is not action packed.  But damn it is satisfying."
1158,2219,"Educational, entertaining, challenging, and almost real chemistry puzzle game. Makes me feel like a real engineer everytime I finish a puzzle."
1159,2219,"A fabulous puzzler that is easy to kill time with.  Takes a while to figure out at the beginning, and forever to master, but lots of fun throughout."
1160,2219,ultimate awesome brain!
1161,2219,"Very steep difficulty curve, but a good workout for the brain."
1162,2219,Befunge in action!
1163,2219,"While building state machines is fun, I feel like this game could have some valuable lessons to teach in the realm of multi-threaded programming for those trying to optimize for the minimum number of cycles per level.Many of the puzzles are devilishly clever and the way the game presents itself it is very well done.  The UI is clear, it allows for player documentation of your state machines, and tries to give you the tools to come up with the best solution possible.  This is one of those games where the leaderboards matter and trying to eek out that little bit of optimization to get the fastest machine of your friends is something I spent a lot of time doing, even after ""solving"" the problem."
1164,2219,"I can't recommend SpaceChem to everyone, but for those with a background or interest in science, particularly chemical reactions, or for those who like trying to find the most efficient solution for puzzles that have many possible solutions, it's definitely worth checking out. The early tutorials fall a little short which makes getting into the game more difficult, but once you get the hang of it the gameplay is very addicting. It's especially satisfying to complete a puzzle, then think up an even better solution that takes a completely different approach.Individual challenges can be completed in 15 minutes or less and can be saved when partially complete, so the game is good for quick breaks and doesn't demand a lot of time (though you can easily lose hours absorbed in it as well)."
1165,2219,"If you like having no clue what you're doing, get this."
1166,2219,Nifty game which can re-teach you some aspects of chemestry you no doubt forgot!
1167,2219,"SpaceChem is compelling, like a gun put to your head telling you to have more fun than you've ever had before solving puzzles by creating molecule factories and designing algorithms to build molecules. Space Molecules."
1168,2219,This game is frustratingly hard. It is almost impossible to understand at the begining. And most the time you turn it on and just stare at the screen. But it is also one of the best games I have ever played. Solving puzzles might be the most fuffilling since Braid. If you like thinking games. this is numba one.
1169,2219,What...Is this even a game? What is this? I'm supposed to build something? There are pipes? And enormous molecules? Every now and then it pops up a histogram to show me how much better everyone else is.I don't know what this is. But I like it.
1170,2219,"Maybe you hated the chemistry at school, but this game will make you love it. SpaceChem is an absolute masterpiece of the puzzle game genre."
1171,2219,"An excellent puzzle game. Complete freedom to solve the puzzles, which sometimes makes it difficult to start.I highly recommend this game."
1172,2219,A great puzzle programing game
1173,2219,Maybe one of the best games ever made. Brilliant and challenging puzzle game with a perfect learning curve.
1174,2219,"This is a thinkin' man's game.  Atoms, molecules, programming, fish flavored food products..."
1175,2219,A difficult puzzle game I'd love infinitely if it made me feel smart a tad more often.
1176,2219,One of the most brilliant puzzle games I've ever played.
1177,2219,Is fun and hard and stuff.
1178,2219,"Challenging and fun, I could waste days going through all the puzzles in this game and then going back to try to optimize all of my solutions. If you like science or engineering you'll love it."
1179,2219,"Best puzzle game I've played in a long, long time."
1180,2219,"A deep, mind-wracking puzzle game. You construct assembly lines to make molecules out of atoms (or other molecules). While that premise seems simple, the application of it varies in difficulty; each level ranges from easy to brain-stompingly difficult. And there are quite a few levels. The game contains something like eight different planets, each with at least five different puzzles to solve. The story, delivered solely through written narratives every few levels, gives one a sense of two things: one, that something's not quite right in Vossler Industries; and two, that there are big things going on to prevent knowledge of the prior. As I write this, it's on sale for only $2.49. If you enjoy puzzle games of any kind, even ranging back to Tetris, this game is a must-have. It will bend your neurons until they ache, but, with perseverance, they will emerge honed, and you will leave with a sense of accomplishment."
1181,2219,"Great puzzle game, a little different from others. Gets really hard in later levels, but is very rewarding, especially if you're into science."
1182,2219,"This game is amazing, one very difficult puzzle game."
1183,2219,Beating a level of SpaceChem is the most satisfying feeling in videogames.
1184,2219,A must have logic game.
1185,2219,"Just buy it, thank me later."
1186,2219,"What kind of game?A thinking puzzle game.  Design solutions to problems.  You use a set of simple, visual programming commands to build a machine to change inputs into new outputs.  It starts simple, but the complexity builds quickly.   The small set of commands are easy to understand and the levels are designed well to introduce each new action in turn with a relatively simple puzzle before asking you to combine it with previous commands in complex ways.A successful solution isn't necessarily the end of that level if you prefer.  At the end of a solution, you are presented with your ranking against the averages of others based on things like how long your solution took, or how many commands you used.  You can continue the gameplay by working to optimize your solution.Who will like this game?Programmers, engineers, fans of games like Incredible Machine, or people who like making crazy automatic things in Minecraft.  Lego builders who ignore directions.The Good:Lots of puzzle variety in the main game, plus a whole integrated set of puzzles that are online.  Histograms allow you to work to refine designs for different goals in each level allowing for good replay value on each puzzleThe Bad:It's hard.  Very few people actually complete all the puzzles in the game (which has been noted by the developer). Special Note:In addition to this Steam playtime, I probably have equal amounts of time played on the iPad version, which I take with me for travel."
1187,2219,Brilliantly original puzzle game from a single dev. This will keep you busy for dozens of hours.
1188,2219,"A puzzle game where you sort of physically program an assembly line to convert a given input to a desired output, sometimes even multiple. It can be very difficulty, especially if you want a fast execution time or low number of components. The story is unimportant, but provides some quirky humor and story for you to read while taking a short break between levels."
1189,2219,This game makes you feel really stupid. Then it makes you feel like a genius. Then you feel really stupid again.I love it.
1190,2219,"I love this game.  Fantastic/maddening logic puzzles, fun sense of design, and a small, but very cool dev-team."
1191,2219,Seriously the best game ever!2017 edit: Still the best game.2018 edit: Remains the best game.
1192,2219,I like the puzzles
1193,2219,"Makes you feel smart, until you lose."
1194,2216,This game has nothing to do with chemistry and all with algorithms. And it's a great puzzle game - despite the danger that you might learn something ;-)
1195,2214,"If you like wizardry and killing Nazis with flamethrowers while scavenging for reagents to make the perfect pot pie for the sleeping princess who knows the wherabouts of the 3 magical cheezits that will help you defeat Dr. Wiley. Well, then this is your game."
1196,2213,"About halfway through the game you realize you want to bite your face off. It gets hard, really hard but it is still fun."
1197,2212,"Buckets upon buckets of gameplay; enough to fill a lake. Without a doubt the best puzzle game I've played in a long time, with many puzzles literally taking hours to figure out."
1198,2211,"This game is probably the most challenging game I have ever played, however that should not discourage you. Despite it's rougher external appearances ""Spacechem"" is one of the most awesome puzzle games that I know of. I would give it a 9/10."
1199,2211,"In essence this is a programming game. You need to design factories where you program the 2 robots inside to create specific molecules. Later on in the game you need to break-down and/or combine atoms or molecules to create even bigger molecules. While this might sound very sciency, don't expect to learn physics from this. But do expect to learn some (basic) programming and logic from this game. Obviously this game is single player, however, with the leaderboards you can compare your scores with those from friends which is a really nice addition. In fact, I wish more games did this. Be warned though, this game can be very challenging. While challenging, it does give a sense of accomplishment once you beat a level or get an achievement. Highly recommended to geeks!"
1200,2211,Best puzzle game I've ever played. Really gets the brain working. If you like a mental challenge you owe it to yourself to play SpaceChem.
1201,2210,My favorite puzzle game.
1202,2210,"Makes you feel like a molecular engineer, it can be fiendishly difficult but it's one of the cleverest game concepts i've seen. The Periodic Table has never been so fun!"
1203,2208,"fun, intellectual, repetitive. you will feel like you are at work in a pretty rewarding career but you won't make any money.this game has charicter dialogue written by a 12 year old."
1204,2207,Great mix of programming and chemistry in a puzzle game. Having a couple of friends who play the game makes you want to optimize your solutions to beat them at least on either speed or symbol count. Awesome game!
1205,2207,"Cleverly designed logical puzzle game. You don't need to know about chemistry to play this game, only a brilliant mind. Perfect for programmers."
1206,2206,"Deep, expertly puzzling gameplay. One of the most deviously difficult (but fair) games I've ever played.Will break your brain eventually. Great fun."
1207,2206,"Good game, takes a while to  figure everything out, but definitely worth it in the end!"
1208,2205,The most challenging and by far the most rewarding puzzle game I've ever played.
1209,2205,If you like puzzle games at all you will like this. It has just the right amount of complexitiy and is very addictive. It also includes aspects of chemistry (not that you need actual chem knowledge) so you will feel like you are learning and being productive.
1210,2205,"If you like logic puzzles with unlimited possible solutions, Spacechem is the best you will find. It will drive you mad quite often but there are some incredibly elegant constructions to inspire you on the web."
1211,2204,"If you're an engineer or programmer, you'll probably find this game fun! Finishing a tough puzzle in this game is pretty darn rewarding."
1212,2204,Definitely a challenging and rewarding experience.  An excellent game with a very fitting storyline.
1213,2204,"""design-based puzzle game""? hardly. this isn't a game. it isn't a puzzle. puzzles are when you put little pieces of cardboard together and make a picture.this is what you get when you cross nuclear particle physics, molecular engineering and computer science. it will make your brain hurt more than a four year degree in biochemistry. you know you're in for some thinking when the game provides you with a handy copy of the periodic table of elements: you might need to know how many valence bonds a particular element has.each challenge is exponentially harder than the last. just barely scraped by on this one? good luck on the next. and if you wanna have fun, it posts leaderboard stats. people COMPETE for fewest cycles, fewest nodes, etc. the most elegant, simple designs win. you might struggle to get one to even work at all, but somebody did it in 4 nodes, and only using one path.get this game if you want to feel stupid. if you want all your other games to look stupid in comparison."
1214,2204,"Fiendishly difficult but infinitely rewarding when you solve a challenge. Hours pass and I am left unblinking, staring at a reaction chamber. Best puzzle game I've played in years."
1215,2203,"I seriously don't understand why I am so obsessed with thinking about this game. I feel like there are about 15 people worldwide who would find this game interesting and fun, and I am damn lucky to be one of them.This is a game about taking chemical inputs and creating, with them, chemical outputs. To accomplish this, you program little atomic grabbers to assemble or disassemble molecules. It reminds me of the tabletop game Robo-Rally, but it takes a more contemplative tone than Richard Garfield's madcap robot programming game. Spacechem is a puzzle game, a thinker, and it's fascinating. If you have the Onlive Playpack, this game is a part of that, so you might not have to buy it on Steam to try it out."
1216,2203,Mind-bending. Infuriating. Difficult. All in the best possible sense.
1217,2203,"A game for people who think inside the box by flipping the world inside-out.  This game will bend your noodle with problems that you know are able to be solved but the answers are not always readily clear and there are no clues.  For an indie game, this is a brilliant piece of software that deserves to be taken seriously by any gamer.  While there is a story to the game, it quickly becomes religated to the background as the sole purpose for playing this game, splitting molecules into atoms and sorting them, drives your need to play.  Worth the time but don't expect to finish the game.  Probably a good test for Mensa candidates."
1218,2202,"A fun and at times challenging puzzle game for those who enjoy real molecule references, a futuristic science-y storyline, and building assembly diagrams, pressing 'Start' and watching as your atoms hopelessly collide with each other due to your poor programming...   *Try the free, extensive demo!"
1219,2202,Great fun for troubleshooters and problem solvers.  I can only hope for a droid version.
1220,2201,"You can spend as much or as little time on this as you want. Once you've solved a level, you can go back and try to find a better solution any time you want to. The premise is based on chemistry and the mechanics use the same types of math and logic skills as computer programming, which makes it a great game to throw at a kid to prime them for high school math and science classes... but since it's not actively trying to teach these things, they won't realize they're being edumacated at the same time."
1221,2200,"One of the best puzzle games I've ever found, especially for programer minded people."
1222,2199,"The problem with puzzle games has always been that they always had specific solutions, and that once you discovered them there was no reason to ever revisit the game. Devs can combat this with challenge modes or compelling narrative or such but once you know how to beat a puzzle game, its core appeal is lost. Enter Spacechem.There are no predetermined solutions here, only what you can manage with the goals set, tools provided and your own ingenuity. Your solutions will be unique. You can strive to be fast, elegant, or compact. The possibility for creativity is immense and there is a -lot- of diverse and quality content to test your mental mettle against. And it's all set to a fantastic soundtrack.Just be aware that difficulty and frustration ramps up drastically after the tutorial. I've literally spent days trying to figure out some of the puzzles. Then again, the sweetest victories are the ones hardest fought.Basically, Spacechem may be the best puzzle game ever. Try it out."
1223,2199,"Hardcore game! Becareful this is not an easy game or a fun game... it's mostly like a second job. You must build a complexe molecule based on a 2 threads systems with basic instruction like Bond+, Bond-, Grab, Drop, Sync, In, Out. The 2 tutorials are bad and show only the basic. From that, starting is hard but this could turn to be fun after you have learned how this work. Great puzzle game."
1224,2198,A puzzle that you are able to solve/manupulate with an ever growing stockpile of tools.  Great mind bender.
1225,2198,The greatest puzzle game ever!
1226,2196,"This is possibly the hardest puzzle game I've ever played. As a programmer, I enjoyed the element of breaking down the problems into programmatic algorithms - you must think like a programmer in order to succeed at this game, taking into consideration if/else, basic logic, input/output, and step-by-step requirements to get from point A to point B.You don't have to be a programmer, or a chemist, or a biologist. You do need to have patience and a solid grasp of logic and sequence. Some of the puzzles, I believe, are a bit too much, taking too much time and effort. It would be nice if you had a limited set of 'skips' that you can use to skip over problematic problems. However, I do believe that the balance of difficulty is spot on.The learning curve is gradual; however, the difficulty of the puzzles increases sharply. This game requires you to think outside the box (and not just one box, but multiple boxes at the same time). This is not a bad thing; in fact, this is exactly what I expect to find in a puzzle game. Not only that, but this game has some ' music. I also like the fact that they added a story to the game, and there are various 'missions' that are different than the basic 'solve this puzzle' scenario. Replayability is available in the form of player-generated puzzles.I highly recommend this game to anyone who's tired of the same lame puzzle game and wants a bit of a challenge. 10/10"
1227,2195,Absolutely stellar puzzle game that intrigues and will have you discovering new rules till about the third or fourth series of puzzles. really an excellent game that builds great thinking skills.
1228,2195,Not for low IQ brainlets
1229,2195,this is a very intersting puzzle game. very original. very well done.
1230,2194,"This may not look as much but it will teach you the basics of algorithmic thinking.If hard fun derived from solving logical conundrums is your kind of thing, then so is Spacechem!"
1231,2193,"This is quite likely the funnest, most addictive puzzle game I've ever played.  Rather than figuring out the trick to the solution like in most puzzle games, you build a solution to acomplish a task.  Then you see how your solution compares to others' in terms of speed and size.  I've completely lost track of time several times playing this game, something I haven't done in years.  For the price you can't miss trying this one out!"
1232,2192,"Actually a lot more fun than it seems at first. I can't really even describe why I like it, but I do."
1233,2192,"A game for those, who really like brain popping puzzles and the periodic table of elements. Completing puzzles is incredibly satisying as you'd have to watch your created contraptions go to work to bring the elements to their destination. Nothing graphically intensive, and a story brought to you with opening and closing text only scenes. If you're looking for a comfortable yet challenging game, try the demo."
1234,2192,"If you have an engineering mindset, this game is for you.  If you don't have an engineering mindset, you can still play!  I enjoy the optimizations, tracking down race conditions, and all kinds of other things I haven't thought about since school that I never expected to find in a game.  Definitely a great time-filler."
1235,2192,Awesome! 9.5/10
1236,2192,It's virtually like doing virtual homework.
1237,2192,Best puzzle game of the year. Word.
1238,2192,play until your head hurts
1239,2192,"Addictive pseudo-chemistry programming puzzle game, definitely worth it."
1240,2192,
1241,2191,...
1242,2191,Super smart puzzle game. My regards to the chef.
1243,2191,"Fantastic puzzler... just about the thinkiest, sleekest game about chemical engineering I've ever had the pleasure of playing."
1244,2191,Programming disguised as fun. Challenging and therefore rewarding. Heavily recommended.
1245,2191,"Great logic game with many, many great puzzles. Will not end soon I guarantee. And has greatest quality logic game can have. Very simple rules and elements that together can be used to create some awesome contraptions. Plus online leaderboard to add a little competition and you have an awesome game!I strongly recomend it to anyone that enjoys puzzles!"
1246,2191,"Spacechem is an ingenious little puzzle game. Build little circular reaction pathways to bond various atoms together without them bumping into eachother. Timing is crucial, but you can pause, synchronise or speed up reactions. It's pretty and very, very clever. Buy it."
1247,2191,Turns your mind into the shape of a pretzel.
1248,2191,"I got a C in high school chemistry. Most of this game goes over my head, but it's still fantastic, and I feel like the smartest man alive when I manage to solve a puzzle."
1249,2191,"This is an engineer's puzzle game!!  Picture having a virtual factory with simple ""pipes"" and controls that push atoms and molecules around - you have to take the inputs, add/remove bonds, and build the new molecule before sending it to the output area and dropping it in the tank.  You have to worry about timing, collisions, synchronizations and more. ADDICTIVE!!"
1250,2191,"A fun open-ended puzzle game, although it gets hard fairly early on and will test your abilities. Even after you beat it there is still more to do thanks to community made puzzles on the ResearchNet."
1251,2191,:)
1252,2191,"This logic-based puzzle game lets you build factories to create molecules. These factories starts out simple, but gradually the games builds up with more and more complex challenges and mechanics to become one of the most difficult puzzle games out there. (Difficult, but never unfair.)After solving each puzzle you can see how others did. This allows you to compare your solution and challenge yourself to create a solution using fewer cycles and/or fewer symbols.The more diffult puzzles can take hours to solve. A small oversight early on can throw a spanner in the works much later. These setbacks makes it all the sweeter when you finally solve it and see the correct molecules being delivered.Beyond the 40 or so puzzles of the main game, there are hundreds of extra puzzles on 'ResearchNet' that have been released over the years. You can also create your own puzzles using the editor or find more 'unofficial' puzzles online."
1253,2191,"Seems simple but really it isn't. A puzzle to make you feel smart, stupid and exhausted whilst still being fun!"
1254,2191,Wicked clever; it begins so simple and evolves into a challenge I geniunely enjoy.
1255,2191,"It is insane how deep you can make a game with such simple mechanics.Spacechem is a great puzzlegame which gives you a great feel when your build reactors do exactly what you hoped, if you make a plan and it works just how intended.It is a bit hard at beginnign to get into it, but once you got the basic thinking for it you already plan out your reactors in your head when you see a new molecule.Nothing fancy in terms of graphics, but simple gameplay which gives you great motivation to continue playing.Also it teaches quite a bit about molecules and a chemistry student should have his fun with it :D"
1256,2191,"Super game, not about chemistry, but programming really"
1257,2191,"Comment faire de la chimie en s'amusant. Ils devraient l'offrir au bac sp physique...Chimie organique, optimisation, logique, programmation, tout en un."
1258,2191,"This games good reputation is well deserved, it's a fun and interesting game based on the not so exciting world of chemical engineering. The puzzles are where this game shines and by giving the player simple mechanics to use the puzzles themselves never get old or too convoluted to understand."
1259,2191,"Millions of combinations of elements. Education can be fun!Go for just getting it done, or try to make it as efficient as possible.This is a thinking person's game. This isn't for small children. I realy enjoyed the mental challenge."
1260,2191,"Construct molecules out of atoms by plotting pathways and plugging in commands. Sounds like a yawn-fest for spotty spods, right? I thought so, too, but it made most of the ""best of"" end of the year lists, so I picked it up in a dail;y deal for under three bucks. I've been fused to my laptop ever since. Addictive, maddening, but you'll feel  like a genius when you solve a puzzle. Solutions are open-ended, so you can upload yours to Youtube and see what others did. This is the best puzzle game I've ever played."
1261,2191,Don't make the same error : don't buy this  !!!
1262,2191,"Fantastic puzzle game, which I suspect will especially appeal to coder type people, since it's very algorithmic. Oh, and if you expanded the playfield, it would be Turing complete (I think)."
1263,2191,"The most challenging puzzle game I've ever played, but I might just be stupid."
1264,2191,Buy this game!! One of the best things to come out of 2011 by far!
1265,2191,"""Factory Programing Game"". Playing this game requires skills to invent to solve problems. You may feel you're doing some sort of a productive design playing this.Is this a fun game? Most likely not. This is a complex, deep, challenging and unique puzzle game which turns a factory programming to an entertaining experience. In order to enjoy SpaceChem, you've get to learn a lot, think a lot, try and try again, discover new way to do things, systemise what you did in the past stages, then challenge new stage. Without any of these processes, you WILL get lost."
1266,2191,"If you are like me, you can ALWAYS make something that works but it wioll almost NEVER be the simplest, most efficient solution. Bah - simplicity and efficiency are for weenies (and chemical engineers, like the guy who designed this game)! Rarely has a game made me feel so satisfied with myself for completeinh one of its challenges. If you like to create and invent, you will love this game. Just don't pay any attention to the graphs of how simple and efficient everyone else's solutions are compare to yours. And if you find yourself besting everyone else in these categories, I'd venture to say you either need to become an engineer or already are one. Bastard. :D"
1267,2191,"This game is AWESOME. It will totally destroy your brain, but the feeling of accomplishment that this game provides when you beat a level is amazing. So much fun."
1268,2191,Well it certainly stands up to the good reviews I read. Really joggs your brain :)
1269,2191,"In this game, you do Science. Yes, with a capital S. But you do it in the future, in space, working for a multibillion dollar company called 'Spacechem'. You help manufacture chemicals and atoms and the like to progress through the levels using a simple puzzle layout, but that can get very complex very quickly, and that's a good thing! It really makes you think about how, exactly, you're going to get that molecule to where it's supposed to be, and in what form you want it to be in. It's definitely a slower, thinking-man's game, so if you're looking for super intense action and molecules ramping off of stuff, this may not be the game for you. But sitting there, and being stuck on a level, and then thinking while you're in the shower, ""Well, if I just put this here, and then do this..."" and having a eureka moment, only to come back to the game and finding that it works? You feel like a scientist. And there's almost nothing more satisfying than that."
1270,2191,"A fun puzzle game that seems mundane at first, but you quickly realize that there is far more to it than simple chemical reactions."
1271,2191,"A fun game if you're OCD and like puzzles.  Trying to figure out how to optimize your production line to make the finished product either in less turns, or in less moves and getting feedback for how you rank compared to other puzzle solvers.Plenty of puzzles, no ""right"" way to do things, I highly recommend it if you're logically inclined and enjoy thinking puzzles.If you like action, can't stand to keep tripping up and don't like offbeat dark humor?  Move on."
1272,2191,"Really cool game, lots of Trial&Error. It is hard tho..."
1273,2191,Very cool puzzle game and its currently on holiday sale!
1274,2191,"This game is like the best puzzle game ever. It's like programming, with all the same issues: ordering problems, poor optimizations, bottlenecks, asynchronous operations, thread collisions, waiting on I/O, interrupt-driven handlers, buffers, and so on. For god's sake, it has SEMAPHORES!"
1275,2191,Excelent little logistical puzzle game.
1276,2191,Good game for the holidays
1277,2191,"This is really  confusing. The lack of a tutorial is infuriating, and I really am only playing it so I can get the TF2 items. TR;DL, game looked promising, but really just pisses me off."
1278,2191,A complex and sciency yet satisfying puzzle game where you play around with chemical bonds.
1279,2191,"A truly original concept for this hard mind bender with good realisation and atmosphere (music, Sci-Fi background). The tutorial seems to make absosutely no sense, but once you give it a go, all the pieces of the puzzle come together, and it draws you into the hardcore mind game. I've bought many an indie puzzle game that looked good but didn't deliver in the end, but this one is pure pleasure!"
1280,2191,"Simple to learn, maddengly difficult to master."
1281,2191,"In this game, Chemistry is fun!"
1282,2191,"One of the most important games, ever. Spacechem captures the spirit of computing science, distilling it into a puzzle game. You have two waldos (threads) that execute commands to produce an output. You build modules and iterate to debug and later to optimise. It's brilliant and a good deal of fun, especially since you aren't creating the game's solution to a puzzle, you're creating your own- the game simply stands back and lets you use the tools it provides."
1283,2191,Hella fun and addicting! Pretend you're putting high school chemistry to use!
1284,2190,"Every time you complete a level, you 'll feel like a genius.Every time you start the next level, you'll feel like a moron."
1285,2190,"This game is for you chemists out there. Here you can solve and create puzzles involving synthesising compounds from elements and the puzzles can get very very loopy. If you want something to work your brain on, then this is for you."
1286,2190,"Do you like puzzle games? Of course you do.Do you like awesome things? OF COURSE you do.Do you own spacechem? OF COURSE YOU DO.(if not, you're missing out)"
1287,2190,Who doesn't want to spend their time programmatically assembling polyethylene molecules in defense against the crypto-space-Illuminati?
1288,2190,One of the hardest but rewarding puzzle games I've played...
1289,2190,"If you like this game, you should be a programmer. If you are a programmer, you will like this game."
1290,2190,"This game will make you think, but not without shortening your hair, by hand."
1291,2190,"Spacechem is less about chemistry and more a programming-puzzle game - You leave signposts on a grid, directing two grabby-thingies and several molecular bonding things to assemble and reassemble molecules.The difficulty curve is a little steep after the first few chapters: it starts you off with making O2 from oxygen, or H2 and O2 from H2O. Eventually, the puzzles become a lot more complex - the one that sticks out in my mind is a boss battle where you are given an infinite supply of water and told to make rocket fuel and plutonium. A later one that has you manufacturing ruby crystals (or a molecule I'm told is supposed to be one) for a laser.That said, it's really rewarding to manage something so complex. -- tl;dr: Puzzles that are hard but not impossibly so. No chem-classes required, but being able to think like a programmer might help."
1292,2190,"A complex thinker that is sure to please anyone at all interested in chemistry or logic puzzles. Conversely, if you enjoy this game, than you'd probably like the red-stone circuitry in Minecraft."
1293,2190,Probably the best puzzle game out there. The friends leaderboard will mean you're always trying to do better.
1294,2190,This is programming made into a game. Brilliant. My very favorite puzzle game hands down.
1295,2190,zweit beste wo gibt
1296,2190,"Don't let the 'chem' bit fool you: knowledge of chemistry is not required. The knack for systematic thought that comes with science is, though. SpaceChem is a puzzle/design/programming game where you have to lay down paths of instructions to manipulate molecules and atoms: binding, unbinding moving and fusing them to create the requested outputs. This *will* test your mind to the fullest. This game can be very hard, especially if you try to optimize a design. But that will make finally getting a working solution all the more sweet."
1297,2190,"Never before has a game made me feel equally brilliant and stupid at the same time, I love it."
1298,2190,One of the best Puzzle games I've played. Mind bending
1299,2190,"This game starts out fairly simple, but quickly becomes challenging as new concepts are introduced.  At its core, it's a computer-programming game wrapped up in a layer that's somewhere in between chemical engineering and alchemy.  The majority of the gameplay involves designing reactors, where various chemicals are deconstructed and reassembled at the atomic level.  For example, you might have a level where your inputs are water and chlorine gas, and you want to convert that to oxygen gas and hydrochloric acid.  So, you have to figure out how to give instructions to your automated ""waldos"" to disassemble the input molecules and reassemble them into the desired outputs. Along the way, you learn more about your employers and the secrets they're hiding."
1300,2190,"Not your average puzzle game. Very challenging and immensely satisfying when you solve a level.  If this game were on a console, people would break many controllers ... WITH THEIR MINDS!"
1301,2190,Fun and challenging game. One where you really have to use your mind. Recommended :)
1302,2190,Wonderfully addictive Puzzle game - Though It can Drive you crazy on the later levels!
1303,2190,"One of the hardest, but most rewarding pure puzzle games available."
1304,2190,Play. Buy. Now.
1305,2190,Good for those that want to play a game on a machine that may not have the best video card.  works great on my older laptop
1306,2190,Zachtronic + Chemistry + Insane puzzle = Spacechem!
1307,2190,"A puzzle game of the highest order with a killer soundtrack- on my top 10 for 2011, easy."
1308,2190,"A very creative puzzle game, although it can be frustratingly difficult at times."
1309,2190,It's an incredibly innovative puzzle game.
1310,2189,"Craziness! Its  cool, I think. But sometimes it can get very difficult. If you like games that REALLY make you think, then you'll like this one."
1311,2189,"This here, gentle reader, is brilliance in a box. I can't emphasize how dumb this game makes me feel when I'm struggling with finding a solution. Then, suddenly I feel like Einstein! It works! I'm a genius! Then I proceed to the next puzzle, play it for a bit and go back to the one I just completed. It needs to be optimized. Then I shave off a few things, make it a bit more elegant and feel even smarter.And that, perhaps, is the most brilliant part of this game: you want to go back, making an even better solution. I'd equate it with programming. Even if you code a solution you always think that you might be able to tweak it just a bit, nip off a line here and a line there. That is this game. Programming in form of a game.The story deserves a mention as well. While I can't claim to have seen all of it, due to being too stupid to progress at the moment, so far it's excellent. It does not get in the way of the game and is pretty much optional. But if you want it, it's there. Buy now!"
1312,2189,"Hardcore genius-level chemical superphysical sciences is to this game as the large hardon collider is to me with your mom. This is to say that those who think that this game requires a doctoral degree in superscience have loose moms, and are also wrong.Basically, you string up a bunch of lines, then put things on them to make the thing that slides over the thing do things, ultimately to pick up things to tie them to other things to put into the thing where the finished things go without hitting the things into each other and nuking the universe with your reckless use of things. If you've got a thing, this it the thing for you."
1313,2189,"Fun and interesting puzzler. Great story with ominous aspects to it. You don't even need to know your periodic table to play it, but it helps a bit."
1314,2187,This game has the unparalleled ability to make you feel smart and dumb simultaneously.  And I mean that in the best way possible.
1315,2187,If you can play this you can cure cancer.
1316,2187,Great puzzle game that is more about spatial organization than chemistry.
1317,2186,"The most challenging puzzle game I have ever played, and one of the most rewarding. I doubt I'll ever finish it though, I am too dumb."
1318,2185,Awesome puzzle game.
1319,2183,Super fantastic puzzle game.  Especially good for programmers.
1320,2181,All I can say it.... Awesome!
1321,2181,Great brain teaser (just don't suffer a meltdown).Feeling like a boss ? Upload your solution and show the Internet how smart (or ridiculously complicated) you are ^^
1322,2180,"A little tricky to figure it out at first, but once you do this game is an awesome puzzle game.  Definately recommended."
1323,2180,"Very demanding, but insanely satisfying."
1324,2179,"This game is EPIC. The challenge is to program reactors with a series of tracks and commands that will produce a specific molecular result. It's far more complicated then it sounds and you have to think on many levels and try to perform the tasks efficiently and in a multitasking manner with the waldos (grabber/activators) that reside in each reactor. One reactor is hard enough, but try stringing together several and producing 2 or more different results to send to different freighters. This is definetly a programmer's game as the system seems remeniscent of a programmable processor that manipulates data and seperates the results to specific outputs. An instant favorite of mine, I'll never tire of looking for the most efficient and effective way to produce the desired output."
1325,2179,This is a really good puzzle game!
1326,2178,"This is the hardest and most rewarding puzzle game I've ever played. New mechanics are introduced gradually. Difficulty ramps up very quickly.There is no ""one way"" to solve a task, the general idea is that you program the reactors to perform a goal. As long as the job gets done, it still counts. However efficiency and speed does result in higher ranks on the leaderboard.In tasks, you are limited by the number of programmable reactors you can use, and indeed the notion of limited space is real catch. If you run out of reactors or diagram space, you'll need to find a way to optimize your layout. I've been programming for many years and these puzzles itch the same portion of the brain. I suppose it's analgous to trying to write a program in 256 bytes of assembler.Unlike many puzzle games, this one fits into a context that makes sense, the story line and the objectives you complete don't seem forced or fanciful. And watching a completed system in action is highly rewarding."
1327,2178,"I was looking at games the other day. Figured Id support the Indie scene and whats this? SpaceChem? Okay, that looks like something Id enjoy. Turns out I was disastrously right. Heres why:SpaceChem is a training tool for many of the skills I value.  Process optimization, design problems, spatial layout, programming, continuous flow problems. It fits snugly in my mind.There is no right solution (just like in real life!), only better, worse, and wrong.I find SpaceChem really difficult. Theres a constant struggle to create a linked sequence of elegant solutions to unique process challenges.I think Im good at it. Judging from the others solutions charts (which is a brilliant idea by the way) Im coming in below average (which is good, since they are all minimize optimal) on all three metrics at once. Consistently. Often on the first try. Of course, this only drives me to attempt ever more elegant solutions, making the game even more challenging."
1328,2175,I am not smart enough to play this game.
1329,2174,"Omfg, SOOO FUNNN"
1330,2174,best.puzzlegame.ever
1331,2173,"Now this is what I call a thinking man's game. It's not for everyone, but if you enjoy puzzle and programming games you have got to give this a spin.Basic knowledge of chemistry makes it a bit more fun, but is not actually required."
1332,2170,"I think this game caters to a specific type of gamer, but check out the demo and see if you like it. It's a logic puzzler at its core, and you can also go down the extreme optimization path as well. Don't let the apparent molecular/chemistry bend turn you off, it really has nothing to do with chemistry when it comes down to it. I've taken a break from it but very much enjoyed figuring out the puzzles. There's also a few slightly different gameplay mechanics to mix things up a bit."
1333,2170,"If you like programming, robotics, or generally putting your mind into a perpetual state of , you will have a blast at this game.This game is kind of like the older cousin that you meet at family get-togethers that picks on you and beats you up.But you secretly like the abuse.You little ."
1334,2169,"Easily the best Puzzle game I've ever played.On each level the player is required to *create* a solution rather than just find the way the developers intended  like in many puzzle games.  This makes the gameplay compelling and rewarding because each solution is very much the player's own.The game is seriously challenging too, starting off with some easy levels so you get the hang of things, but quickly ramping up to missions that require complex solutions that actually take planning and ingenuity. For puzzle fans the game is well worth its normal price tag.  For everone else, at least try out the demo; the demo in itself is a decent length and will definitely make you decide whether this game is for you or not."
1335,2168,A quite difficult but satisfying production line puzzle game. Spacechem has such clever pacing and replayability you will certainly get value for your money until you reach the glass ceiling. The menus are well done and the fake chemistry and story is interesting and will likely most appeal to programmers.
1336,2168,"I expected SpaceChem to be a cerebral game, and it delivered. What I didn't expect was for it to be so damned hard. I'm only about 25% through the missions, and some of them take an hour or more to complete. Finishing the game will an 80 hour task.SpaceChem is fun, if you like logic and programming puzzles. I'm hesitant to recommend it, because I know many people won't enjoy this. I think, though, that if you like this kind of game, you know who you are, and you'll find SpaceChem to be both entertaining and deliciously unforgiving.There are some nice non-game features, like leaderboards, in-game video recording (for Youtube!) and creating forum signatures based on your progress. One side effect of the videos, though, is that people seem to be looking up solutions on Youtube and duplicating them. You can tell by looking at the leadersboards. Why would anyone play this way? I dunno.Anyway, I won't be finishing this soon, but I won't be uninstalling it, either!"
1337,2168,"The hardest puzzle game I've played in recent memory. There are loads of puzzles to do so there's no shortage of content. However it's more a matter of how much you can stomach playing. All the puzzles require you to start from scratch without hints (after the tutorial maps) and get increasingly complex, with more gameplay components being added every few maps. I don't know if it gets added in a later level or not (I'm about halfway through the third world now), but this game REALLY needs a hint system. The amount of complexity can be overwhelming and one mistimed reaction or misplaced pipe can lead to compounding failure and rage. Many times I have spent 30mins-1hr on a puzzle only to start over from scratch.I recommend this if you enjoy puzzle games, but prepared to visit youtube for solutions. A nice feature included is a built-in youtube recorder and uploader to show off your own solutions too so they are easy to find."
1338,2167,"This is the greatest puzzle game... of all time!  Once you get past the fact that it uses the real periodic table of elements and real valence numbers, it is so freaking satisfying to complete your machine and start cranking out those space chemicals."
1339,2167,This puzzle game doesn't force you to think like the developer. There isn't a single right answer and the game encourages you to improve your solutions.
1340,2167,"Finishing a level in SpaceChem is as intellectually satisfying as curing cancer would be. I love this game. Buy it, stick through the frustration and learn to love how much it hates you."
1341,2167,This is a good puzzle game that will blow your mind!
1342,2167,"Absolutely awesome puzzle game. Some puzzles seem daunting at first but are really fun to figure out how to piece them together. It's also really fun to try and optimize your machines to run the fasters/with fewest instructions.Also, any computer scientist should be reminded of turing machines while playing :P"
1343,2167,This lets you build machines that create awesomeness.
1344,2166,"A unique puzzler that allows for creativity. There's usually more than one way to solve every level; you can sacrifice speed for efficiency, or vice versa, but you aren't penalized for doing either.  A great pickup if you're looking for a brain-bender."
1345,2166,You think SpaceChem looks boring. I would know; I thought it looked boring years ago and you think exactly like me. That's why I was pleasantly surprised to find out that it is a work of genius. One of the most fiendishly complex and satisfying puzzle games I've ever played.
1346,2166,This game is tied with Picross and Guru Logic Champ for my favorite puzzle game of all time. Absolutley fantastic brain burner.
1347,2166,"Thsi is a seriously brain-busting game, but I still found it easier to grasp than their previous effort, the Codex of Alchemical Engineering. It has a lot of subtleties and all kinds of different solutions you can apply to the puzzles, all they require is sufficient application of fake chemical engineering.Atomic manipulation! Giant eldritch monsters! Moustachium! /SCIENCE!!/Get it."
1348,2166,"If you like puzzle games and or chemistry, you will probably like this."
1349,2166,"Spacechem is more about problem solving than puzzle solving -- a subtle, but important distinction. If you are a programmer or any other profession that thinks in logic and flowcharts, this will be right up your alley... if it doesn't feel too much like work, that is."
1350,2166,"Don't be fooled by the game's classification as ""casual"". The puzzles in it can be brain-breakingly difficult, and some of them - such as ""Nothing Works"" and ""No Ordinary Headache"" - aptly describe just how difficult these puzzles can be.Despite that, though, it's fan entertaining little game - a tad frustrating at times, but nothing quite beats the satisfaction of finally solving one of those really knotty problems . . . at least, not until you run into the next one!"
1351,2166,Really awesome puzzle game that will leave your head banging on the keyboard due to the sheer amount of complexity of the problems to solve.
1352,2166,"Guaranteed to make your head hurt, but still worth it :P"
1353,2166,"This game is half maddening, half amazing. You're given a simple set of tools, that have some very basic applications in the begging. Very quickly, more and more complex puzzles are put forth and you find yourself on a steep learning curve that is immensely rewarding. Not for the faint of heart, but a lot of fun."
1354,2166,"It's about programming state machines to do fake chemistry and it feels like working, but it's also an addictive puzzle game.  I spend far too long optimizing my solutions once each level is complete."
1355,2166,"Best puzzle game I've ever played, so simple but so deep. Only downside is it sometimes feels like work, but when playing it, I often find myself dreaming up solutions to puzzles at night."
1356,2166,"Frustrating?  Yes.  Fun?  Absolutely!  SpaceChem may not be for everyone, but if you can wrap your head around what's going on, you'll find it satisfying to come up with the solutions - or see if you can improve upon what you've already solved."
1357,2166,"Very different, but causes you to think..which is something more people need to do more often : )"
1358,2166,Best puzzle game for many a long year...
1359,2166,"This game has made me want to punch my monitor out of frustration. It has caused me to reach for a pen and paper to work out fusion calculations. It has made me stare, blindly, listening to the soothing music, trying to bend my head around Wallies (because  Waldo, seriously) and lines and the coloured mishmash that coats the matt black of the reaction chamber.And for that, I  love it. A legitimately difficult puzzle game with interesting mechanics and an interesting story to tide you in between missions."
1360,2166,This is the funnest math problem you will ever play.
1361,2166,Really complex puzzle game.  Good for people who like programming and spatial reasoning.
1362,2166,Al Quaida Employee's training simulator.
1363,2166,Awesome game
1364,2166,"Holy mother of god, this game is AMAZING. Screw Professor Layton, this puzzle game is the real mind-bender. Great puzzles, great music, incredibly easy to run, and the TF2 items are actually very hard to get. Fantastic for anyone willing to bust a few brain cells."
1365,2166,"Pretty interesting concept. You need to build Atoms/Molecules out of other atoms/molecules by breaking/creating atomic bonds and using fission/fusion to combine atoms together to get the desired result. You do this by ""programming"" the reactor to do certain actions. Sometimes, multiple reactors are required. Some solutions are simple, others not so much. At the end of each level you get statistics on how many cycles/reactors/symbols used to get the final result, and it gives a graphics comparing you to your friends and others in general. Overall, the game is pretty fun and addictive."
1366,2166,"I love this puzzler. It's clever, logical, very well executed, with an amazingly polished interface... it's also hard. Damn hard. Silicone-carbine-scraping-on-diamond hard. It will make you weep bitter tears. It's all about tinkering, but tinkering alone won't get you anywhere... you have to have a plan. Preferably, a good one. If you like difficult but rewarding logic puzzles, this is a game you need to check out."
1367,2166,Challenging puzzle game; highly recommended
1368,2166,Its too good...
1369,2166,"A mind-bending, production-line-esque game of rearranging, bonding, and tearing apart molecules. Fantastic indie game. :)"
1370,2166,This game makes me realize I am not nearly as smart as I think I am.
1371,2165,I played this game enough that it invaded my dreams.
1372,2165,"It might not look like much from the screenshots, but it's really addictive and makes you think well hard. Well worth getting I recon."
1373,2165,This will hurt your brain.
1374,2165,"A decent puzzle game based around the basic principles of chemistry, thankfully with enough deus ex machina technology involved to not require a degree. It has enough pacing that you don't get bored or feel overwhelmed, although the game is most certainly for the logical and patient. As I am neither, the intermediate levels are currently absolutely skull-f**king me."
1375,2165,"A game that achieves the surprisingly entertaining combination of visual programming and ridiculous chemistry, Spacechem is well worth trying if the initial part of this sentence made any amount of sense to you."
1376,2165,"This is a pretty neat puzzle game. It has a lot of logic and timing to it. For some reason, I think it would appeal to programmers. I love it, even if it can be -ass hard at times. Which is what makes it all the sweeter when a level is finally solved. There's a demo, check it out..."
1377,2165,Addictive game. Especially fun if you are into programming.
1378,2165,"Puzzle game of the year?  Maybe!No real chemistry involved here; it's basically visual scripting with a limited set of ""instructions"" (tools) and a geometric aspect. If you like coding/scripting, or if you like building contraptions and watching them crank along, then you'll probably dig it. It does quickly get complex. This is not an easy game. Fortunately the solving process doesn't (always) involve just staring at the screen, but rather building different aspects of a possible solution to see how they work out. So it's engaging even when you're not immediately solving stuff.The nifty thing is that each problem has lots of workable solutions. If you like, you can tune your solutions for efficiency or speed, and see how you compare to other players. I'm only halfway through the campaign myself, just taking my time and occasionally going back to earlier stages to tweak my solutions.You can see some solution examples at spacechem.net or on youtube."
1379,2165,"SpaceChem is a really fun puzzle game! If you love making some fake science with a couple of puzzle solving, then this game is for you!"
1380,2165,The puzzle game that makes you feel smart and stupid at the same time!
1381,2165,"You have to have at least a dual-core brain to keep up with this puzzle game. If you meet those minimum requirements, it's very enjoyable and actually feels rewarding as you're solving each of the increasingly-difficult, multi-layered, pipelining problems. The music is also top-notch and fits in perfectly for what could be hours spent on one puzzle alone.This game highly promotes the unique way each individual can tackle a specific problem, and I can't really accurately describe my thoughts right on how it feels when you actually solve a problem that's personally challenging - sometimes wiping the slate clean multiple times to try to see it from a different angle; but it feels good at the very least - sometimes even cathartic."
1382,2165,Easily the cleverest puzzle game of the last decade. It also has a belting soundtrack.
1383,2165,That's some mind bending puzzles right there
1384,2165,Melts your brain. In a good way.
1385,2165,WOW
1386,2165,Best puzzle game ever.
1387,2165,"A game for engineers, but you could love it if you are one :)."
1388,2165,A surprisingly simple becomes very complex puzzle game.   If you (like me) like problems that take timing and planning ahead 10-20 steps as well as sandbox like construction buy it Noaw!
1389,2165,Great for anyone who likes to use more than a fraction of their brain power.
1390,2165,Highly addictive and will ruin your sleeping pattern.
1391,2165,This is a really solid science-y puzzle game. Try the demo!
1392,2165,"This game is mind-numbingly awesome.  Six Flags has a rollercoaster called ""The Mind Eraser"".  This game is what they mean.  Aaaaaawwwwwsome!!!!!"
1393,2165,"If you thought Portal 2 had challenging puzzles, or if you get scared at the thought of Tetris, then by all means, stay clear of Spacechem. On the other hand, if you love the afforementioned titles, then by all means, do indulge in a puzzlegame based on pure logic and exact science. Incredibly deep and massively engaging, Spacechem's systems and background mechanics will make your brain work like a well oiled V12 engine. In spacechem you have to program a nuclear reactor and assemble, or crack atoms. And that is just the entry level, when you get to einstein level, you have combine your atoms with more atoms, think about bindings, and load them into freighters. While making one compound is a walk in the proverbial park. You have to make make a pattern that is infintely repeatable...on all levels. Making that walk in the park a bloody streetfight in a volcano...in space."
1394,2165,"Great If you like really hard puzzles, better if you like chemistry (though not required, as its not realistic to chemistry). Also its in Space. Its not so great if you like your brain to not melt XD. Puzzles are very rewarding when you complete them though :D"
1395,2165,Spacechem is a very challenging but simple game in which you design algorithms in order to get inputs a & b to outputs a & b. Get ready to lose 5 hours while slowly optimizing your design and then feeling like an idiot when you see that you're 2000 cycles behind your friends.
1396,2165,"I am an alchemist, I am an automatist. My eyes and fingertips become fountains of light and my chair tips back, rises into the air, and careens off into a field of darkness and light, where I can taste the sticky bittersweet of solid electricity and feel my blood turn to gasoline. Suddenly I am struck with a divine inspiration, calling to me from beyond the infinite, and I roar in a pain most exquisite; its voice resonates with mine and then every force of space and time becomes prostrate at my feet.SpaceChem."
1397,2165,"If you like puzzle games, and aren't afraid of a challenge, this is a must have."
1398,2165,"Absolutely fantastic puzzle game, very open ended, many solutions to even the hardest puzzles."
1399,2165,Take a precautionary step to prevent Alzheimer's - Buy this game!!
1400,2165,"A good puzzle game, although it can get VERY complex. If you love puzzle games, though, it's definitely worth checking out."
1401,2165,Possibly the hardest game ever.
1402,2165,"Chemistry meets computer science! Or something silly like that. It's an engineering game, so not for everyone, but fun and complex ^_^"
1403,2165,Extremely challenging.
1404,2165,Nice programming type of game. very unique and puzzly. Also writing a recommendation for it gives you a ticket for the summer sale ;)
1405,2165,"addictive, fun and very difficult."
1406,2165,Hardcore puzzling.
1407,2165,Crazy visual programming game
1408,2165,"A game for engineers, but you could love it if you are one :)."
1409,2165,"SpaceChem has the potential to become synonymous with hard. Not hard like insane action game hard, oh no, this is perhaps even more intense. Bond molecules, break molecules, form new molecules and output them from the reactor. Then when you think that's all there is to it, you zoom out and realise there's sometimes more than one reactor! The learning curve is pretty steep, but the tutorials give you a good staring point. If you don't like using your brain, I cannot recommend this game. If you do though, then get your thinking caps on because we're going to do some chemistry!Disclaimer: Chemistry not actually real. Don't try breaking strong bonds at home. Free atoms can (and probably will) cause nausea, hearing loss, pain, death, and even explosions. Not for the faint at heart."
1410,2165,Try it. It'll make you feel really smart AND really stupid.
1411,2165,"If you black out and wake up to find that your file's been advanced through the game, don't worry. This is the intended method of clearing most levels."
1412,2165,"Stupidly addictive little puzzler, worth every cent."
1413,2165,"This game definitely puts the achieve back into achievements... fairly simple to understand, fiendishly difficult to complete, and just when you've finished a level you get hit with the average online performance showing you did the worst possible solution.. A small, basic, low-budget puzzler aimed at visually programming solutions, unquestionably the most cerebral game I've ever seen but still massively addictive."
1414,2165,"A fantastic puzzle game, mostly for people who like programming, but others should also enjoy it. At the start of most puzzles it will make you feel like the most moronic person that has ever lived, at the end of it, you feel like a genius. Then you see your score compared to others and you feel like a moron again.I am radomaj and I approve this recommendation."

1428,2165,"This is a  killer puzzle game, you ...."
1429,2165,"A great little puzzler with no knowledge of science needed. Attempt to create molecules that match what you need to output. Starts easy, gets deviously hard as you try and work out the programming tricks.Highly reccomend."
1430,2165,"This game challenges you in ways that many other games don't - by actually making you think through the level you're solving. You'll have a damned hard time solving some of the levels presented in this game, but when you do solve it, the feeling is the same as when you have just finished putting together an awesome LEGO set. And then you can try to optimize your solution.The only downside is that, sometimes, the interface will get a little cluttered, especially if you have many reactors going at the same time. However, the clutter didn't stop you from playing with LEGOs, did it?"
1431,2165,"Sort of like super meat boy using your brain instead of your thumbs, painfully hard to get the best scores but you can't stop trying."
1432,2165,"Very impressive logistical/mechanical/logic-based puzzle game; each challenge is a mix of building a route, building a machine, and building a program all in one. The production challenges linking several boards (reactors) together to work toward an end result give it a level of freedom and satisfaction I've never seen in a puzzle game before.It has more in common with building a road network in simcity or warehouse network in a trading sim than navigating a maze, pulling levers in the correct order, or rearranging blocks. You're given an input and are challenged to reach an output, but you're given a lot of tools and freedom to get there how you like. Check out the demo if It sounds interesting. Highly recommended."
