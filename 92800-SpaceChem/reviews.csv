92800,38,4,LonMcGregor,639,355,1,10.2,"November 1, 2014","SpaceChem is a puzzle game that deals with atoms and molecules.I don't really think the story makes that much sense, but where this game really excells is in the puzzles.The game is made up of chapters and levels. Each chapter will introduce one or two new new gameplay features. The levels take you through an easy tutorial of how to use the new element, and gets progressively more challenging. This learning curve is very good.As for how the levels themselves work, you are given various tools and a grid. The job is to move elements (like hydrogen/carbon etc.) around, and join them to form molecules which you then pipe out. It initially seems easy but once you add mulitple reactors piping out to each other it quicky adds more of a challenge.My only issue is, if I find myself becoming fixated on ridiculously complicated solutions. You can't skip levels if you are finding them too complicted. This means if you are completely stuck and can't progress unless you can solve each level sequentially.This game is controlled with a mouse, but has keyboard shortcust to make things easier to control. This works really well, in my opinion.The graphics are very simple, which is good as it makes it easy to see what exactly you're doing.The music and sounds in this game are very nice.There are extra challenges included once you complete the game, and ones that can earn you extras in TF2, it seems. This coupled with the wide number of challenges means the game definitely has a very good play-through time.Definitely buy this game if you like puzzles, but don't buy it for it's chemical/scientific accuracy."

92800,27,1,Gristalis,662,14,1,100.3,"October 17, 2014","Having played through the base game, Spacechem is a great puzzle game at it's core. Pros - The puzzles. They become increasing harder as you go along, but it is pretty steady. Each set of puzzles build on skills you have acquired from the previous. There are challenges associated with many of the puzzles. You do not have to complete them to beat the game, but they really make you think and work for the achievement. They can be tough, but I enjoyed solving them. Nothing in the game is forced on you with the challenges and achievements. It saves your progress so you can keep moving forward in the game and go back later to beat the challenges. I really felt a sense of accomplishment finishing this game. Many puzzle games become the a+b =c formula and thus, boring. Space Chem held to the end.The controls and UI worked really well. Learning the hotkeys helps. There are many videos on You Tube. Really cool after you beat a puzzle, you can see how others did it. I did not see any of my solutions online and there are may ways to solve each one. The instruction on new tools were good. Told you what you needed to know and left you to figure out how to employ them. The periodic chart was a useful addition.Cons – The story outside the puzzles was a cheese sandwich with the crust (Try eating one and you'll see what I mean, dry and chewy, just sayin'). Not the worst I have seen, but after while I didn't bother. I mention this only to point out it does not take away from the great puzzles. That is the heart of this great gem. If you don't like the story, skip it. The graphics do not interfere with the game at all. They were functional. I highly recommend this game if you enjoy puzzles that challenge your critical thinking and problem solving abilities. This is an exceptional game. Skip the story, solve the puzzles. You'll feel smarter, I do."

92800,0,0,76561198028903083,376,70,1,8.7,"September 15, 2021","Long ago, computers filled rooms and program instructions were punched onto cards (which tended to be dropped onto the floor, and disorganized, just before an assignment deadline).  We students puzzled over some simple, assigned task, punched instructions onto our cards, and then ""ran"" the cards to see if our instructions would perform the task, or would instead just crash and produce an error message.   Few saw their cards run right the first time; most, instead, saw the dreaded error message, and then pored over their cards, trying to find a formatting or logical error to explain their little program's crash.    This game reminds me of that ancient experience.   Here, the ""coding"" we do is visual, and our instructions are easily placed onto paths of our own creation (mostly).  We have the freedom of imagination to instruct largely as we choose.   But when finished instructing, we must ""run"" our creation and see if we have succeeded usefully, or must instead pore over our design to solve a disclosed error.I suspect that if you were or are good at writing computer programs, you will feel oddly at home in this game.  But if you weren't or aren't good at programming?  This still presents yet another chance to bite at that cognitive apple, and it might prove to be a satisfying bite.  I believe this game can lead someone, if he or she has some imagination and resolve, to experience the same positive glow that one gets from happily seeing one's newborn program run successfully and elegantly to perform a targeted task.  I owned this game for a few years before I got around to trying it, which I did, for the first time, this evening.  I'm sorry it took me so long to try: it is a truly wonderful game.  Other Zachtronics games have been very good, too: but this one, surprisingly, may turn out to be my favorite. It has a similar feel to Opus Magnum, but it might be even more admitting of individual and distinct approaches.  And any game that can even approach Opus Magnum in that regard is a stellar choice indeed.  The tutorials are good.   I believe some reviewer said they do not ""hold your hand.""   Well, they hold it a bit.   But they also expect you to start observing and pondering from the start.  This led, at least in my case, to a certain satisfaction and feeling of achievement even as I made my way through the series of tutorials (which I have about half-finished, so far, I believe).  Admittedly, however, at first I had to sit calmly and really pay attention to what was already on the screen, right in front of me, before I could realize what I should try next.     I'm glad that I didn't just give up in the first couple of minutes: this game would have been a terrible shame to miss.   As an interesting bonus, the game will remind of some light chemistry (although a knowledge of chemistry doesn't really seem necessary to play it).  It will remind of the periodic table and the individual elements within it.  Furthermore, the game will teach the chemical formulas of some real-life, important compounds -- and it will do that almost automatically, as progress in the game is made.  But despite the game's involvement with chemical formulas, the skills the game really calls upon feel to me much more like programming and planning skills.   Yet a foreknowledge of computer programming doesn't seem to be required in order to play and really enjoy the game.  Long story short?  I wrote this review immediately after my first session with it.   I've made good progress through the tutorials, but haven't finished them all yet.  Yet in this very first session of playing the game, it managed to engage me for hours.  If the tutorials are this much fun, I can hardly wait for the rest of the game to begin.  Zachtronics provides some games of real genius; this is yet another one of them.   Fortunately, one doesn't have to be a genius to enjoy this game; being fond of an interesting, well-designed series of challenges, and of learning by doing, seems enough."

By bonding chemical elements onto tracks and carefully monitoring them, puzzles are solved.  Its very simple in concept, but becomes very challenging very quickly.  Alongside just solving regular puzzles, boss battles provide more difficult puzzles under a time limit.  The music is charming and a joy to listen to, with some great ambiance and background noise to to get the mind working.CONS: Being a unique puzzle game comes at a positive, but it also creates a very large detriment.  The game's difficulty is in a league of it's own.  Where some puzzles took five minutes to solve, some took well over an hour.  On top of that, some of the game's features are not explained very well, though online guides do help break down the mechanics.ACHIEVEMENTS: Good lord, this list took some time to complete.  If you're good at these types of puzzles, it shouldn't be that bad, mostly challenges for completion under a certain value.

When I was at school I had all chances to get in programming University, I passed all exams, but changed my future profession to another subject at last time. I liked solving different tasks with BASIC. It was very satisfying.This game is a simple simulator of programming. You don't have a lot of freedom, but you can plan. You start with several steps. Your routes are getting longer and more complicated each new mission. You get a puzzle (reactor routes) inside a puzzle. The game becomes extremely difficult, but you will get amazing feelings after solving each new puzzle.In overall, the game shows you basic of programming. It is a great way to understand can you be good/bad at programming. Also, it is a extremely hard puzzle game which requires a lot of planning and thinking.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1819968862Pros- A great idea. It is like a programming but for commoners. Plan you actions and achieve goals- Nice progression. You start with basics. Each new level gets slightly harder. Puzzles get hard after second world.- In the end of second world you get a puzzle inside a puzzle (you can route inside a reactor.... and can route elements between reactors)- There is a story- Music is greatCons- Didn't find anyhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1819968929ResumeAn excellent games. It is great for people who are considering learn programming. Also, it is just a great puzzle game. Learning curve is very intense.

There was just so much logic to cram into two reactors, that I tried and tried but couldn't come up with the right approach. I watched some solutions on Youtube, but was fortunately to proud to just copy one. After putting the game aside for a few months, I tried it again and did it. The feeling of success was immense, even though the statistics that can be seen in a histogram after each level were bad.Wikipedia gives the perfect description of the game as ""visual programming language"". The most difficult restrictions, when designing the solutions are that only one command for each color can be on a field and that each field can be only run through from two sides (before flip flops are introduced). So later solutions sometimes blow up in size, because you run into unexpected problems and somehow still want it to run. But after all everything can be optimized and made better through hard thinking and that is, what makes this and other Zachtronics games so great.My main criticism is the lack of a storing option for several solutions at once. I would for example like to use aforementioned solution as a starting point for optimization, but at the same time try completely new approaches. It's not possible without using another profile where I would have to do the complete game again upon this point. Since newer Zactronics games (which I bought later on sale) have this option, I would now recommend OpusMagnum and Exapunks more than this."

Imagine having two variables in an addition, and somehow the addition is performed before the second variable is assigned.Spacechem is a great game if you're not serious about it, but if you like mathematics and optimization, you will get frustrated really fast.

What that means is that there's not one ""right"" answer to a puzzle, instead, it's an open-ended question.The graphics, mechanics, and sound are all really good, and if you like optimizing assembly lines, this is the game for you.Most puzzles hinge on you being given not nearly enough space to do something comfortably, and being forced to squeeze your assembly lines into places they really don't fit.The storyline is decent, not great, but where this game shines is the high you get from solving something that looked impossible. As for content, the game is pretty long itself, and the user-made levels are practically endless. (Though, as fair warning, a lot of the user levels had a difficulty curve that made the main game look like a tutorial. It was like hitting a brick wall of ""oh god how is that remotely possible"") All in all, this game is excellent, just really niche. If you're still unsure, look up ""Codex of Alchemical Engineering"" online, it's a free game made by the same people, with an almost identical feel. If you like that, buy this. If you don't, don't buy this. You could almost think of Codex as a demo for this game, and that would give you a much better idea of whether you'll like this than all the reviews you could read."

It's a logic/puzzle/machine game where you make little ""assembly lines"" that turn things made of circles into other things. Those things happen to be molecules and atoms in the game, but it would make more sense for them to be mechanical parts or just plain blocks (like in infinifactory).While the 2d assembly-line puzzle aspect is well done, the game presents itself as a chemistry game although nothing you do in the game bears any relation to real chemical engineering. To make ammonia in the game you use your assembly line to place 3 individual hydrogen atoms around one nitrogen and then trigger your ""bond atoms"" device and ta-dah, you've ""assembled"" a single ammonia molecule from its component atoms.Concepts like activation energy, distillation, reduction/oxidation etc have no place here, it's basically programming a car assembly line but instead of a frame and four wheels you have a circle with a C and four circles with an H."
92800,15,0,zkopf,190,4,1,36.4,"December 9, 2018","SpaceChem is a great puzzler game.  It seems simple at first but it quickly becomes devilishly tricky.  As a programmer it’s a good mental exercise because working with the circuits and waldos is a sort of visual programming.  I was surprised how many computer science concepts appeared: state machines, inter-thread communication and timing, producer/consumer, deadlock and starvation.  For more sophisticated, elegant solutions, you must know the system inside and out.  For example, you'll need to know the color priority of the waldos (some solutions won’t work if you swap red and blue).  If a waldo hits a wall, it will repeatedly execute a command it's sitting on. Bonders also execute in a certain order which must be determined experimentally. Watch SpaceChem tournament videos on YouTube to learn these tricks and more. For harder problems, these details are not only convenient but necessary. If you’re stuck on a problem, it’s not because you’re not smart enough.  You may just need to better understand the system you’re working with.  I like that after completing a puzzle, my solution will be compared to those of other players in terms of time, number of reactors, and instructions.  You can also see the individual scores of your friends.  A very satisfying puzzle game.  Have a fishcake and enjoy!"

The gameplay is two fold, making factories that assemble and disassemble molecules from or to atoms.  Outputs from factories are piped into inputs for other factories.  It's interface is easy to learn and there are keyboard shortcuts, which I appreciate.This game at its heart is a 2D puzzle game.  The scoring so to speak is based on three different optimization scales, fewest cycles, fewest parts, and fewest factories used.I found the story fun, with a tone of seriousness.  That and the music makes for nice atmosphere.  The game is challenging and thoughtful.So, let's look at the value defined as playtime, vs. advertised price ($10) at time of authroship (2018-SEP-25), 50h / $10 = 1h / $0.20.  We're calculating 20 cents an hour here, that's like 35 times better than a movie, and like 70 times better than a 3D movie, or new iTunes release.  Like puzzle games that make ya think?  Want to learn the periodic table of the elements and atomic numbers?  Fun game, 7/10 doesn't seem fair.  I would rate 8/10.

92800,0,0,naesten,130,5,1,148.0,"September 22, 2018","I'm pretty sure this game is harder than TIS-100.While SpaceChem programs can have more than 15 instructions, the closest you get to comments is that you can diagram the ""molecules"" that you intend to be sent through each intermediate pipeline.  It can be quite tricky to find room for the instructions you need without causing your ""molecules"" to collide with one another or with the edges of the play area, which gets extremely frustrating up until you manage to squeeze everything in, but that just makes coming up with a tight design super-satisfying.  If simply solving a problem isn't enough for you, you can try to optimize your solution for speed, symbol count, and reactor count.  I've heard the histograms haven't been updated in a long time, but that doesn't make it any less satisfying to find your score to the left of a big bump in the graph.The ""production"" problems additionally require you to choose how to subdivide the problem into pieces you can tackle with the available reactor types, but on the other hand they allow you to choose how to subdivide the problem into manageable pieces.  However, if you can't come up with a good approach, you can often find a reddit comment where someone gives a hint describing a set of reactors in terms of their inputs / outputs and (in tricky cases) interconnections, and there's still plenty of satisfaction to be found in actually programming the reactors. (In one such case, I have yet to understand how the poster managed to make their implementation as inefficient as they say it is: apparently, their version has three atoms looping around getting fused up to Uranium, but I had enough trouble figuring out how to inject a second atom into the loop in my version when I realized that one Uranium was not enough.)P.S. If it wasn't clear by now, this game is definitely not about chemistry, it's merely chemistry-flavored.  (As are the fish sandwiches, which I do not think should be eaten under any circumstances whatsoever.)"

The systems are fun to use and manipulate, the learning and difficulty curve is pretty much on point, and the game (so far... I haven't even come close to beating it) introduces enough interesting mechanics to build on what the player has already learned which keep the game interesting. Not only that, but most puzzle games have one solution, which the player has to find. I'm not bashing this as an idea, some of my favourite games work this way, but SpaceChem feels special in that it pretty much gives the player a blank canvas with a goal, and leaves the player with their knowledge of the game and the elements they're given to get to that solution however they want. It has a level of creativity that most other puzzle games simply don't have, and I loved every second of it. As such, beating a level feels particularly satisfying as I beat it using MY solution, rather than just ""oh. that's what I was supposed to do. I guess that makes sense"". It's not even an illusion of creativity as several times I've been introduced to a new mechanic, not understood it (most of the stuff in this game takes time to wrap your head around) and just beat the level without even using the new mechanic, just using my previous knowledge. The visuals, while not artistically outstanding, are cool and get the message across, which is kind of the aim. The music is also very fun. Lore-wise, pretty bad. The story is given as text for the player to read in their spare time which is one of the worst ways to tell a story in games imo. I don't know if it's any good because I never bothered to read it, but I'm not gonna be harsh about it since when I bought SpaceChem I wasn't exactly thinking ""Oh boy, this should be an interesting story"". Lore isn't what I'm here for and it isn't what SpaceChem provides, which is fine.I may be a bit late to the party (somehow I never heard about the game until recently lol), but if you have any interest in puzzle games or like programming in any way I would certainly recommend giving this game a shot.

It is the puzzle game I've been searching for.  As others have said, it is more of a programming game than a puzzle game, solving production problems in a limited environment with limited resources.  And your solutions are your own, potentially unique to anyone else's, which will solve the problem ... for additional challenges you can go back and optimize (cycle counts are monitored as well as 'symbol' use - where cycles are essentially how long your solution takes, and symbols' are the number of instructions required to carry out your solution in the graphical 'programming' interface).  It's cerebral, not tactical, and if you need a break from shooting up zombies this might be a good choice for you.  Or maybe check out the more recent Opus Magnum, which is next on my list to play when I've burned through SpaceChem.

Secondly I would like to point out the fundamental difference between Spacechem and most other puzzle games. Most puzzle games flow something like this: 1. you make a few failed attempts2. you hit a brick wall3. you muddle around aimlessly for a while4. you have a eureka moment5. success! Steps 2 and 3 are not fun...Because puzzles in Spacechem have a large number of workable solutions, you never hit that brick wall of ‘what does the developer want me to do here?’.Spacechem is less about eureka moments and more about breaking down each problem into smaller problems, then whittling away at those using cold hard logic.

The game design is incredibly simple yet very deep.  It’s not just a matter of completing the levels - it’s often more fun to simply watch and improve the solutions you have, and the post-level histograms do a great job of incentivizing this.The game is really great at being an educational game without being an “educational game”.  It manages to teach complex concepts in a way which are broad enough to be applicable to real world design.  For example, basics of parallel processing are taught in some form or another… you’ll encounter race conditions, synchronization issues, waiting/locking, etc… These lessons are introduced gradually and organically; first by the use of the two waldos on a single job, and later emphasized in levels which you handle multiple reactors.More generally, the game also does a great job of teaching about design compromises.  It’s almost always impossible to minimize symbol usage, reactor usage, and speed, so you’ll have to choose which to optimize for.The only downside is that it can feel like “work”.  Granted, it’s a magic version of “work” that’s always leading towards rewarding, lightbulb-over-the-head moments.  But still, I find it kind of mentally wearying to play for extended periods of time, particularly on the more challenging levels.

This might sound simple on paper, but you're wrong. Very, very wrong. Because of two things:1. You only have limited space in a reactor, 80 tiles2. The programming language is in that space and is executed as your waldo moves along the symbols.This gives SpaceChem a very interesting challenge: how do you construct reagents with just this limited scope? And that challenge is just scratching the surface.You can only go over a specific tile twice: once horizontally, once vertically. You NEED to take advantage of this to do anything complex. Let's say you have N₂ with a single bond, and you want it to have a triple bond. What you do is drop it onto some bonders through a grab/drop horizontally, perform two bond + instructions, and then grab it vertically from the same tile of the grab/drop. Now you're holding a triple bond N₂. Fantastic.Then the game drops a bombshell: fusion. Now you're performing addition with atoms. You can make almost anything as long as you have enough input reagents. Sikutar will break you.Then the game drops another bombshell: flip-flops. Now you can make loops, counters, etc. Remember going over a specific tile twice for specific things? It's now (mostly) a thing of the past! Just go over it again with flip flops. Amazing!Then the game drops another bombshell when you access ResearchNET: fission. Now you're doing ADVANCED math with atoms. You WILL need to bring up a notepad to figure out most nuclear puzzles. Absolutely bonkers.You'll tear your hair out trying out some of the later puzzles, and rage quit, but then you'll be dreaming about atoms and possible optimizations...Just know you most likely won't be seeing the ending.

Each level you are given a puzzle to solve, and the puzzles become increasingly more complex as they rely on your ingenuity and originality in placing instructions and commands for atomic reactors to function and process molecules.  The instructions you give the reactors works sort of like a code, though everything is physical and tangible on your screen, at least on the level of circuit building.  You cannot make devestating mistakes, but you can edit and revise the programming limitlessly and there are infinite possibile solutions to each puzzle.  The real grind comes down to making fastest solution with the least amount of instructions."

Not just while actively playing, but a way to occupy your brain during those boring, spare minutes while trying to fall asleep, while doing mindless tasks, etc.Spacechem is finally deciding to go to sleep, only to jump out of bed as you were about to drift off, compelled by a sudden idea for how to solve that one level.Spacechem is the beautiful dance of atoms across the screen in a running solution.Spacechem is occasionally discovering little details of how the game mechanics work that can improve your solutions, because honestly, the tutorial levels don't do *that* great a job explaining everything.Spacechem is a string of head-scratching moments and eureka moments.Spacechem is the satisfaction of improving an old solution using what you've learned since.Spacechem is thinking your solution knocked a level out of the park, only to indignantly re-approach it when you discover that your friend did it in *how* many cycles/symbols?!Spacechem is a fairly reasonable difficulty curve, but the difficulty curve also doesn't stop right up until the end of the game.Spacechem is a very difficult game to beat (3.8% completion rate).Spacechem is getting distracted from progressing in the game because you'd rather improve previous solutions, or dive into the player-submitted ResearchNet levels (and because Boss levels aren't as fun as other levels).Spacechem is solving levels without the waldos leaving the input areas, just for the hell of it and because the solutions inevitably look cool.Spacechem is trying to solve challenging levels in a community tournament.Spacechem is accidentally upping your steam 'hours played' count by leaving the game running in the background, only to jump back into it every once in a while with a few small changes. Sorry, steam stats.Spacechem is guiltily getting around to beating the game and getting those last couple of achievements when you notice your hours-count is past 1000, because you were too distracted by all the other interesting things to do in the game.Spacechem has, for all practical purposes, endless replay value.Spacechem is the best puzzle game I've ever played."

As a player you are given great flexibility in solving the puzzles (cutting up and putting together various molecules in ""reactors"") but the biggest contraint for me is myself; since your score at the end of a level is evaluated with all other players. There is always this added difficulty in trying to make the sollutions as efficient as possible.The music is not bad at all, but the game has nothing special in the way of sound, but this is no real hinderance since I play my own music while playing. The learning curve is quite steep so take time in the first levels to just mess around with the game to see what can and cannot be done.Only downside I suppose is that the speed of the reaction once running is still quite fast; I would have preferred if it could be turned down a notch or so for when I'm testing.

The game subtly pushes you towards making elegant solutions by having leaderboards that show your friends' metrics (how many cycles/steps their solution took, how many reactors they used, how many logic symbols it took), which adds another layer to the challenge. It's the kind of game where I'll be stumped by a problem and will walk away, think about it over the course of the day, and then come back and try out some of the solutions that I'd thought about. A lot of trying and failing and refining until you come up with something that works.

I logged out 6 hours later.This puzzle is the rare kind that have a relatable backstory. You don't have to read it to advance in the game, and it's not forced down your throat. It's nice and relatable, especially for people who worked at a high tech firm before.The tutorials could be a bit more interactive, or at least animated. Some controls are well hidden, and never explained throughout the game. The graphics are… OK, it's not beautiful. Well, it is, if you are into retro gaming, but given it's 2017 and you are playing as an employee of a space age high tech firm, it's pretty low. However, you spend most of your time on the reactor screen, which is pretty good.Controls are OKish. You can't customise the keys, though, so unless you like to play dragging and dropping, prepare for the standard WASD keys (and you still need your mouse). Oh, you are using Dvorak or Colemak, or another esoteric layout? Then you should stick to your mouse.The puzzles, however, are really nice. You occasionally get an easy one, that can be solved in minutes. But then you get an insane one you spend hours to figure out, without finding a solution. Oh, did I mention there is no easy way to start over? I really miss a reset button.All in all, this is a very good game. I can spend countless hours without even realising it. You should definitely try it."

Not saying space isnt real, but I know stars, the sun, and moon are not what they are taught to be. Further more, once you learn that no curvature can be detected on Earth from any experiment, and you learn Earth is flat, you really start to get a good perspective on how just about everything that is taught is complete hogwash, along with history.Check out this book in link below. Curvature cannot be detected. No matter how hard you look. It doesn't take much common sense to put two and two together. The problem is, no one wants to actually do the research. They just see the words 'flat earth' and turn livid; because, we've been brainwashed by this lie since we could speak. It's normal to reject it at first, but if you do not research it for yourself, then you're just cheating yourself. Modern science is a religion and it takes faith to believe in all these theories that are needed in order to support more theories. Did you know gravity is still just a theory that needs the theory of relativity to be true for it to be possible? Just look it up.The book is called, ""Earth Not A Globe"". Check link below for free download. Also, look up ""Convex Earth The Documentary"". We've been lied to. Once you can accept that, then you can see the world with new eyes, and everything begins to make more sense.

92800,0,0,76561198111654939,300,72,1,92.3,"April 23, 2017","SpaceChem is basically its own genre of puzzle game. Each level requires you to program the ""waldos"" (the red and blue circles) to move input molecules around a screen and create different molecules as output. As you progress in the game, more commands are introduced which allow you to use the waldos in more interesting or more efficient ways. I played this game for 92 hours, more than any other game in my account, to beat every level and obtain the 20 achievements. It has remained challenging and engaging throughout, and I have never played a game quite like it.What really distinguishes SpaceChem from puzzle games in general is that it is open-ended. It feels like you are inventing a solution, not finding it. For any given puzzle you will find people who have implemented a solution and optimized it in dozens of conceptually different ways. Speaking of optimization, it's important to mention that the creators made optimization totally optional. Yet, I have found that some of my most satisfying moments playing the game were getting some highly optimized solution to work (e.g. with just one reactor, or with a tiny number of symbols) after hours of effort.As far as programming games go, a major strength of the game (over, for instance, TIS-100) is how visually intuitive it is. Everything is executed by the waldos moving around the screen; nothing is hidden from you. Debugging your program is simply a matter of watching what happens when you click ""run"". You don't really have to read what the rules are, as you just learn them by experimenting.I do have some negative things to say. I am not alone in complaining that the boss fights are not as enjoyable; especially the very last level, which was made difficult in a number of annoyingly artifical ways and ultimately made me take a few months away from the game. Having beat it, I appreciate it a bit more, but the limited space for the reactors was just unnecessary. In general, I think that I enjoy small, elegant puzzles a lot more (which I can then go and optimize), rather than these 5- or 6-reactor messy puzzles where the solution is to put a whole bunh of easy pieces together into a working contraption, and debug it."

The learning curve is steeper than perhaps any game I've ever seen, and you're expected to pay close attention whenever the game teaches you something new. Oftentimes just looking up the solution for a puzzle online won't be enough to help because it requires a thorough understanding of how things work in order to progress. However, once you get the hang of the mechanics and are into the rhythm of the puzzles, it is one of the most rewarding puzzle games I have ever played. The complexity of the game means that there are millions of creative solutions for a single puzzle, and I've even gone back to previous puzzles to improve on an old design after learning a new trick or two. The room for improvement is almost infinite; I could see playing for hundreds of hours and still getting better.So if you're a puzzle aficionado willing to get past the first two hours of struggling to understand what the hell is going on, it's easy to lose yourself in this game for hours at a time.

It is unlike any puzzle game I had ever played, and luckily I was able to purchase it on sale (but it is well worth ten dollars!!). The premise is surprisingly simple and quickly learned, but the developers force you to learn the subtle complexities behind each action/choice you make during the process of solving a puzzle; this is what makes the game so masterful.You CAN figure the puzzles out, but it will require the casual gamer to think in ways s/he has never before.Challenge yourself, don't give up, AND THIS GAME WILL MAKE YOU SMARTER WHILE ALSO MAKING YOU FEEL PRODUCTIVE.Experiences such as taking breaks from a puzzle and yet pondering/dreaming about possible solutions are inevitable for one with an inquiring mind. One of the greatest lessons that one can learn from this game is the process of breaking a single objective into multiple steps and then treating each of those steps as a process/objective of its own. Once a solution is achieved, YOU WILL FEEL WELL REWARDED. *Note: This is a long, replayable game with a catchy soundtrack. I have not finished the game but the story is an interesting addition to the gameplay and is worth following. Even just a slight understanding of chemistry/programming helps, but is not required. I am a chemist, so, personally, the chemistry aspect behind Spacechem was enough to entice me. The game can be likened to performing a chemical experiment in the sense that a puzzle can be visualized in the following way:                                       Reactants ---> Intermediate(s) ---> ProductsBut, of course, the processes are not realistic chemical reactions (or rather the intermediates are not realistic)."

Two ""waldos"" move along tracks you design and execute commands on those tracks. There are several different commands and new mechanics that are implemented as you play.There are three game ""modes"" in the main story: ""Research"", where you work within one reactor; ""Production"", where you use multiple reactors; and ""Defense"", essentially ""Production"", but with added commands and boss fights. Throughout the main game, the player is told a story of a protagonist who joins SpaceChem, a company that produces chemicals, as they learn of its dark secrets.The game is simple at first, even up to the third world, but then one hits this game's learning cliff. Where it seems the puzzles can't possibly get more difficult, they do. Exponentially. It took me over a year to beat this game (though I played on and off times), and that was just the main story. SpaceChem has loads of user-created puzzles (I believe over 100) that further test your knowledge of the game. Your solve times are also ranked against other players on histograms. SpaceChem also has a full and powerful level editor and ways to upload your own puzzles. The community is great too, although it has been less active.There's just so much to do in this game - you'll find yourself spending hours just solving or optimising single puzzles. Nothing beats the euphoria you'll get from finally beating a puzzle you've been stuck on.Overall, SpaceChem is worth the full asking price as an excellent design-oriented puzzle game. It even has large discounts on it and its DLC very often, and trading cards to go with it.

Rather than lines of code, the two ""waldos"" follow symbolic instructions placed along their track.Pilarbox aside, the game has aged well on Windows. Not so well on Mac and iOS. If you're playing on a Mac, you'll need to download an additional tool to fix your installation. (Why the developer can't distribute that fix through Steam remains unclear.)If you've ever written multithreaded code (and enjoyed it), you'll love this game. One of the most important instructions is ""sync,"" which works just like a cyclic barrier. Both waldos must reach a ""sync"" instruction before either can continue past one.

Start with loose carbon and hydrogen atoms and figure out how to produce acetylene. It's not just ""stick these here, stick those there, bond 'em and let 'em loose"" because you need to figure out pathing and process, order of operations, and process management. SC calls upon quite a few skill sets, yet somehow never feels like work; it's surprisingly entertaining. The scary thing is that you're actually going to learn. Maybe not chemistry, as such, but programming, order of operations, process management, logistics... give it a chance, and you might find yourself sharpening skills you never knew you had.

You are tasked with ""performing"" chemical reactions and you do this by creating looping set of commands out of given symbols within the reactor. The challenge lies not only within figuring out which commands use and in what order, but also in 2D planning. Space in the reactor is limited and you have to make sure, that the atoms won't collide with reactor walls or other atoms.If there's one aspect of programming, that SpaceChem got really well, it's the fact that there are many solutions to one problem. When solving puzzle for the first time, you can go with ""whatever works"" solution, but ater, when you have more experience, you may reiterate through levels and try to optimize them by the number of used symbols or elapsed cycles. Game slightly provokes you to do that by showing global stats for each level and comparing it with your own.Overall it's a very engaging game if you're into that sort of things. I wouldn't recommend it for people looking for more casual puzzle game, but otherwise SpaceChem is really enjoyable experience."

I only completed it as fast as I did because I consulted guides on how to solve the different assignments, else it would have gotten rather tough early on already.The main objective in SpaceChem is lining up two production circles, one red, one blue, to grab whatever is put into the reactor, to then output something different, be it a broken down product, something fused together, or something simply taken apart and put back together. The way SpaceChem wraps it into a Lovecraftian space adventure provides an interesting story, if sometimes a bit predictable. But nevertheless, it is a game that has replay value, because there is no fixed way of solving the problem presented. There are fast ways, there are efficient ways, there are fast efficient ways, and then you can do it as complicated as you like - SpaceChem provides a variety of solutions even for the simpler puzzles.And when I say simpler, I mean puzzles involving a molecule consisting of two, maybe three kinds of atoms, and the product requiring the same atoms in different configuration. Later on, when more options are available, your synapses will be frying from trying to figure out how the Hell to tackle the problem at hand."
92800,0,0,Emperor-William,50,19,1,5.3,"August 1, 2016","potentially the most difficult game on steam, best headache i've ever had!"
92800,1,0,cyrilpanda,813,649,1,37.3,"August 1, 2016","I think the beauty of this game is that there is never any ""one solution"" like a lot of puzzle games end up falling onto. You're free to create whatever solution you can think of to solve each puzzle... within the confines of a rather restricted space. And it may not look too restricted at first but in the later worlds, whoo, does space management become a big aspect. I understand the need for it though, having no space restraint would make a lot of puzzles really simple in comparison to what they are now, though.The difficulty curve of the game is pretty dang smooth, ranging from simple in world 1 to ""literally hours for every single puzzle"" in worlds 6 through 9. But no challenge ever feels insurmountable when you face it, just intimidating. It's very clearly a programming-styled puzzle game, and it hits all the right nerves with that; designing the best functions to keep the overall design running smoothly, optimizing ever so slightly to hit a time quota, finding new and more efficient ways to solve a problem that subsequently frees up reactor space you desperately needed. I'm one to dive right in to the puzzles and keep tweaking away at them until I hit upon something that functions the way I need to, and then stubbornly stick to whatever functions unless I can't possibly work around it, and, generally, the game doesn't stop me from using this philosophy successfully. There's probably something to be said for planning out something elegant in advance, too, and I bet there are some really cool puzzle designs made that way. It's a game that feels very free, even in its restrictiveness.The game's visuals are basic but effective, they get the job done. The music is... I honestly have no clue, there's too little of it for how long the game runs on and I had to turn it off and put on my own music after a while. The story is passable, but with how long I went between each time I played this game I found it hard to keep track of.That is one thing... this game is incredibly exhausting to play. I'll hammer away at the solution for one puzzle for a few hours and then when I've solved it I'm completely drained and end up not coming back to the game for weeks or even months. Before today the last time I played this game was at the start of June, for instance, and I've been picking away at the levels since... around last october, I believe, at least during this attempt at getting through the game, which for the record was like my third time overall, I think. So yeah.I can definitely see this game not being for everyone but it's certainly a good experience if you're programmatically-minded, though definitely a challenging one, easily one of the hardest puzzle games I've ever played, but I wouldn't have it any other way."

I could cheat, sure, but where’s the fun in that? According to steam only 3.7% of players have the “game completed” cheev – but that is a cheevo very hard earned.One of my fav things about this game is the replay value, which is super rare among puzzles.  For each level there are charts to show how you ranked vs the rest of the internet over 3 separate criteria.  Even when winning you sometimes know you can win better.My only complaint would be a lack of deep tutorials.  There’s a steam page out there with “Things I wish I knew while playing SpaceChem” that I honestly can’t consider cheating but I wish the game had taught me these things instead of asking the internet for tips & tricks.Who should play:  People get a boner at the thought of a multi-layer logic puzzleWho should not play:  Everyone else, particularly people with little patience"

It uses some aspects of real chemistry, which is fun for a true nerd.It has some replayability as there are countless ways to solve each puzzle and there are stats at the end of each level that could be improved upon for an added challenge.There are many plusses to this game, but specifically I enjoy the lack of a timer.

But SpaceChem is the only one Zach made before he knew how to balance things for the mass market. If you're scared of getting stuck and want a ""play by your own pace"" game where you can set your own goals and finish the story no matter how good you are, play Opus Magnum. But if you want a game that will hound you, torture you, keep you up at night, make you fight tooth and nail to push your design to fit inside the reactor by sheer power of will, and leave you feeling like no one person should be allowed to possess this much spatial thinking power when you finally beat a hard level, this is the one and only.It feels amazing when you're sitting in some of the later defense levels, hectically flipping switches in a very precise sequence like some hamster in a wheel that's part of a huge Rube Goldberg machine to substitute for the remaining parts of your design that you should have automated but didn't have room for anymore, and then you ever so barely manage to trigger the end of level *just* before the whole construction would blow up from all the excess waste products that you didn't find a proper way to dispose of anymore and just kind of stuffed away in some corner hoping the game wouldn't notice in time.

SpaceChem doesn't deliver. I open a new level, keep looking at it, imagining that I can do it ineffeciently but still do it and keep staring at it in search of elegant ""aha!"" solution. Then I realize that no, it has to be done dirty, you just optimize said dirtyness. And thus you set it up, maybe see where you can cut few corners, run into visual space limits, groan, repeat. Rinse and repeat. I could be doing real programming, maybe with more actual ""oh, this would be elegant"" moments than this game.As of right now, I just can't push myself through another level, because yea. That's not entertainment for me. Dirty optimization may work for some like Factorio with bigger goal, but as separate puzzle levels... nah. There is a bit of management play by connecting reactors while you set up the annoying visual programming with limits inside each reactor, but gosh, do I not wanna.It doesn't help that aesthetical enjoyment are all-time low in this game. Fine enough presentation, but it lacks any drama. Story is given in bits here and there as plain text, music is just one of random loops.

And I really love puzzle oriented games. In other words, this game should be a perfect fit for me.For the most part, this game is amazing. They took a very simple premise, and made a puzzle game that can get really complex. Additionally, since it is possible to design your own puzzles, I can easily understand the existence of online contests around this game.Unfortunately, I think that it is my programming background that shows the flaws in the developement environment. The help screens (and tooltips) are a bit lacking in detail. The cut-n-paste mechanics are a bit too weak. The ability to save components for reuse are also not useful enough. I understand that this is just a game, and not an IDE, but it is a programming game... or perhaps, I am just being too critical.   In summary, I do recommend this game, but it is not perfect."

I can't figure it out. I feel dumb & not exactly motivated to solve"" ↑ On hindsight that level isn't particularly hard, but this game is minimalistic, which means—(1) more possibilities (good)(2) no clues (good and bad)You can think independently, explore freely and feel happier when you discover a certain idiom of symbol arrangement on your own.Buuuut, it might bore you before you ""get"" this game. When I just started, some basic techniques totally eluded me, like multiple entries within 1 run, or overlapping pipelines. I didn't cheat; it took me a damned long time to figure that out. Outside-the-box thinking requires serious wrestling.Once I got to the 3rd & 4th planet, it was pretty fun.It was challenging and getting addictive. When I beat a level but my solution wasn't the neatest, I'd even replay the level.There was also more variations in gameplay.The mid and later portions are really difficult and tedious.I haven't finished.

I get what it's trying to do and applaud the originality of it, but the execution brings it to a halt to me.Your task is to build certain molecules. Probably awesome if you're a chemist, but it beats others over the head with details. The actual game is layed out in a very, VERY minimal (even abstract) way, and because everything has to fit on a single screen, you either ""see"" it or you're messing around. Spacechem certainly isn't the only puzzle game that can get frustrating, but to me, this is one where solving puzzles didn't wow me. Perhaps because the field is so small most of my approaches failed to start (meaning: you better have an elegant solution RIGHT AWAY because otherwise you can't tweak what you build).At first I thought this kind of game just wasn't for me...but after playing infinifactory (which is more or less this game in 3D - by the same makers), I now think it's because this game is just too minimalistic and has a too narrow playing field."

Spacechem offers dozens of puzzles in a story-driven campaign, where you need to design and optimize atomic assembly lines. Usually, you just need to produce given compounds, but the real fun begins when you need to manage the reactions in real time to defend yourself against exotic space monsters.For serious players, the game offers achievements, an optimization race in leaderboard statistics, and hundreds of player-created puzzles in the Journal of Reaction Engineering.While the main game environment looks very technical, you will become absorbed in building, optimizing and debugging your reactions to achieve results that initially seemed impossible. The austere environment of reactor grids is accompanied by beautiful hand-drawn visuals of various planets and cosmic monsters. The music is original, fitting, I would even say motivational, yet another high-quality element of the whole impressive piece.So, if you are actually reading this review, I cannot recommend Spacechem enough.

I bought it on a whim and I have not been disappointed.What you have here is a casually serious game. How's that work? No time limits except for a rare occasion; You can easily stop, reset everything, and try again without repercussion. Make a mistake? Oops! No need for save scumming. Just hit the stop button and try again.(Dusts off highschool chemistry book)... Okay there we go. You may not need this (knocks on book) or be in an episode of Breaking Bad, but understanding how chemistry works is important. You simply cant put an atom here or there, willy-nilly and expect the same product.Timing, Loops, Logic, and Forethought. Being bred into a musical family, the first three I am very capable of. The forethought? Not so much. You have to look at paths, instructions, and syncronization. If you let some parts go without some sort of ""wait for blue/red path to reset"", you can bork the whole thing in a bink of an eye.While this game gets progressively more difficult, it doesnt leave you hanging. Sure there's going to be some face-planting on the desk, but when you realize that the instruction symbols have other options it changes the game. When your puzzle fails, it will show you where you failed. You just have to figure out why. You dont always have to use BOTH red and blue.The soundtrack music may turn many of you off, but I found it inspirational and motivating. There are not many songs, but they have that ""movie"" feel. Hard to tell its all synthesized."

What starts out as nearly trivially simple with the first level or two quickly becomes a mind-bender which keeps on busy for ours. The whole is packaged with minimalistic graphics which suite the games just perfect. Any more eye-candy would have been a distraction. The puzzel interface is also well made, with shortcut keys allowing for quick restructuring. What remains is the 'storyline' which  is surely rather minimalistic but still motivating to 'move on' to the next level and see what happens. If you like training your brain with novel ideas, this game is a must-have. Just don't be too hard on yourself if you get stuck over a puzzle for a long time  - finally cracking it is so rewarding!

92800,56,0,huggabledolly,93,1,-1,7.4,"January 30, 2016","TL;DR:It's not a bad game, but you should think carefully about whether or not you are the target audience.On paper, SpaceChem sounds exactly like my kind of game. It's a playful take on concurrent programming, and on top of that, it's themed around chemistry.I like puzzle games. I like programming. I like chemistry. Surely I will like SpaceChem then, right?Unfortunately not. I tried really hard to enjoy this game, but each time I play, a very distinctly nagging feeling hit me: I could just be programming. The game isn't bad in any notable way, and I actually had some fun playing it. But I just have so much more fun actually programming.This will be a ""buyers beware"" to the kind of people that get irritable during handhold-y tutorials and on-rails games.SpaceChem is a game. Not a sandbox. This game boils programming down to two concepts: Solving the problem, and optimizing your solution. There is going to be one single ""best"" solution to the problem at hand, and your solution is going to be either optimal or sub-optimal. End of story.Here is why you will probably like this game:If you need someone to tell you what your immediate goal is, if you feel uncomfortable with just being dropped in the deep end with no milestones or objectives, this game is for you! Intimidating as it may seem, this game does a wonderful job at providing the player with a controlled environment, clear goals, instructions and rules.Here is when and why you should think twice about buying this game:This game does its own thing, and it does it well, but it is neither chemistry nor computer science in any way. It is a game with a theme. At most, it is about repeatedly improving on solutions to the same problem. Hence, neither ""because programming"" nor ""because chemistry"" should be your reason for purchasing this title.If you have a fascination with chemistry, have done any programming in the past, or just generally prefer sandbox games, this is not that."

It's an automata programming game.I remembered the first time I see such a game when I was in high school. It's called  Manutactoria . You are literally programming Turing Machines there. And I think SpaceChem is quite similar: the semantics of and the interactions between the elements are simple, but with these simple elements, you can do infinitely complex jobs.It's hard, but not all that hard. I completed all the puzzles in the story line except for the optional ones and the final boss fight in a little more than 20 hours. You do need to focus on the most specific things like the placement of the bounders and routing the two waldos through the array of symbols, and some times these problems are solved with ugly ad-hoc tricks, but you definitely should go beyond that level. Once you discovered how to do a recurring task like moving around a cross-shaped array of bounders to assemble or disassemble a methane molecule or arranging several flip-flops to perform a sequence of commands a desired amount of times, the puzzles starts to get easier. You quickly figure out similar structures in the input and output and decide what should go where. Then you adjust your known structures to solve each step and the job is done.Every time when you see in the statistics that your dashed yellow line is way to the left of the peak of the bar chart, you feel clever.Those at the right end of the chart are not stupid either. Everyone who progressed to the later part of the game must be clever.But some people are just more clever than others. The research net is the difficult part. It is organized into volumes and issues, just like real scientific journals. Amusing. But the puzzles there are seriously difficult. Most of the time you stare at the puzzles and think, ""How is that even possible? The author must be insane!""When you finally solved a difficult problem and see your efficient and elegant (or not so mush so) production pipeline running, see those materials flowing in and products flowing out after some arcane transformation, you start getting fascinated, even though you are the one who built those things. Sometimes I am amazed at how good us humans are at discovering patterns and constructing increasingly complex structures from simpler ones. Maybe that is central to our intelligence."

(EDIT: It seems to not be saving my progress. Dammit. Oh well, I guess I get to have more practice, then.)I've played a lot of programming puzzle games before. As a general rule, if you're teaching an aspect of computer science, it usually turns out fairly good, and if you're just teaching people how to bash directions into a small space, it usually sucks.And then you've got stuff like SpaceChem, RoboZZle, and Jahooma's LogicBox, which are a bit of both. And they turn out amazing.(There are other categories, although Hack 'n' Slash gets its own special category for pretending to teach you how to hack but you have to go through some cumbersome chores first and you get bored before you finish them. Avoid.)SpaceChem, from a computer science perspective, is a game about multithreading, and avoiding race conditions. Or something like that.From a non-compsci perspective, it's about moving atoms around, binding them together, and hoping you get the right results and also hoping they don't smash into each other.Either way, it's a puzzle game that holds your hand for a few tutorial levels and basically gives you the ""standard"" answer, and then leaves you to it. It has a rather sharp difficulty curve, but even if you're stumped on a later level, you can always go back to an earlier one and look at just how bad the ""standard"" solution you were given on a silver platter was, and improve on it.You can also compute compete against your friends to see who can solve a puzzle in the fewest number of cycles, or use the fewest number of symbols... or the fewest number of reactors for some of the later puzzles that are still early enough to be in the demo version.Did I mention there's a demo version? You should play it, and then if you like it (and I will make you like it) then you can throw your money at Zachtronics and get the full version.In short, SpaceChem is a really good programming puzzle game that teaches you the fun of dealing with race conditions, and there's more than one way to do each puzzle."

On the surface, it looks like some kind of strange puzzle game that requires you to know a thing or two about chemistry, and while it does actually kind of touch on and teach really basic chemistry topics, it has nothing to do with it otherwise.No disguising the fact that it is a puzzle game, though, and a very logic heavy one at that. Every level tasks you to get a certain output from a set of inputs, and the mental gymnastics you have to perform to get some of those outputs are astonishing. Like most truly good puzzle games, the way you solve it will probably be different from the way the developers thought to solve it, your best friend will think to solve it, your dog will think to solve it; the whole chain of command. At the end of every level, you're given a graph showing the best and worst scores for the puzzle, and you can hit tab to see how you compare to your friends, and eventually see where your friends gave up. The rankings gauge you in three areas - how fast your solution performs, how many reactors your solution uses (efficiency part 1) and how many commands your solution uses (efficiency part 2). I tend to get all of my high scores in fast solutions, and I find myself replaying the same levels over and over to try and create a more efficient, speedy solution. I'm sure the novelty of that will wear off... probably.Certainly the best game I've purchased for a dollar, and it really outshines some that I've payed more for. For the amount of content and replay value in this, I'd say its normal price tag of ten dollars is a fair price.

That plutonium is then used in nuclear warheads together with rocket fuel that you have to synthesize, and that warhead is launched in real time at a giant octopus attacking your facility, no questions asked. The game is not exactly easy, but it does a decent job introducing new mechanics exactly once you have mastered the previous one.SpaceChem is a crazy mix of really dumb fake chemistry, really smart solutions, really cool boss fights and a really bizarre-yet-thrilling story. You also get exclusive cosmetics for TF2 if you manage to solve special balls-hard australium puzzles, only for nobody to recognize your genius in that game."

As someone who loves puzzles, logic and figuring things out this game is perfect, albeit incredibly difficult. Sometimes I just stare at the screen for half an hour wondering where to start, but preparation is paramount and once I have a basic flow diagram in my head of exactly where I want each particle to go, it's just a matter of linking it up, and that is half the battle won.Tip: Keep your reactors clear of mess by pacing your items very carefully - plan, plan, plan.This quote rings true here: ""Given ten hours to chop down a tree, I'll spend nine sharpening the axe.""All in all, easily worth the $10 if you enjoy hard puzzles and lateral logical thinking. If you're the type of person that sees a hard puzzle and gives up, you will not like this. This game is a challenge.

No, there is nothing about GMO's in the storyline, but the allegory is there. As you build molecules and use them to trigger reactions, everything may look perfectly sound... but thousands of cycles later, an error you missed can crash your whole assembly. Kind of like how GMO's seem to be perfectly executing cycles of DNA, but what will happen generations down the line?

There's nothing quite like the satifaction of watching your tangled mess of a solution actually work. I only have two qualms with the game: The boss battles often involve incredibly precise timing which leads to a necessity for optimization of your spacechem reactors. Some people may like this, but I found it pretty tedious. Secondly, the difficulty ramps up IMMENSELY on the last few worlds and some of the final puzzles can take hours, days, or (in my case) over a week to work out a solution. As of this writing, less than 4% of SpaceChem players have even managed to finish the game. Despite these two dings, the game is unbelievably fun, relatively cheap, and a great mental work-out.

The ""chemistry"" thing is a clever aesthetic conceit to make it so the simple objects you're assembling seem to have some real world grounding and help motivate you to solve the problems.  A cool thing about it is how open-ended it is for a puzzle game; as you run your assembly line, you get a count on how long it takes to output the quota of chemicals.  I've spent a lot of time going back to solutions that were good enough to pass, just to find ways to make them more efficient.  Sometimes this means making minor adjustments to reduce the pauses necessary to avoid collisions, sometimes it means changing the whole assembly line.  There's a lot of replayability here.One issue with that replayability is that there isn't an obvious way to back up your previous solutions (within the game that is), which made me reluctant to wipe the slate clean on my nicer solutions.

You've been warned!.The game starts with easy to understand tutorials and easy puzzles and then, difficulty increases puzzle after puzzle up to the hell.The overall goal for each puzzle is to get some atoms or molecules and transform them, to send the results to some storage  later.To transform particles, you use reactors. Each reactor can have up to two input and two ouput spots. You chain reactors and storages through pipes. You can chain reactors to produce the final product with the help of intermediate products.Reactors have some kind of program, with some special instructions: wait for input, grab, drop, rotate, bind, unbind, sync, branch if certain atom is being detected, flush the output area, etc. You will have to ""program"" a sequence of instructions to solve the puzzle and, just with the instructions and tools available for each puzzle.Graphics are good and attractive enough for this particular kind of game. The User's Interface is clear, easy to learn and, easy to use, very straight forward. You can do everything with just the mouse or, you can use keyboard shortcuts if you like it.The game was very well programmed, has no glitches, works smoothly and, seems to be very well optimized.This game is one on its kind. The idea is very original and, even that game mechanics sound so easy that can end boring you, the real thing is that puzzles are so challenging that you don't have such a feeling.But, be aware, if you don't like games that challenge your mind, don't buy this one; after a few of short easy puzzles you will face really challenging ones.I could say this is a casual game but, believe it, once you start a challenging puzzle, you will loose hours or days trying to figure out a solution. It's highly addictive.You can learn from solutions already designed by other people, by watching some youtube video (and, yes, you will do that), To beat the rest of community of players, you should solve the puzzles by using the less ammount of cycles (production cycles), the less amount of resources (reactors, storages, etc.) and the less amount of symbols (programming instructions).

The tools you are given to create elements seems to never stop and the intense complexity of some of the later levels borders on a form of cerebral torture which makes the solutions all the more rewarding when you get there. I often find myself chanting ""YOU CAN DO IT, YOU CAN DO IT"" before it's 3AM and I haven't inserted the right number of flip-flop sync cycles to detach 2 hydrogen atoms and bind them with Silicon and Phosphorous which come as inputs in a seemingly random order.

I enjoyed the first few puzzles, until I ran headfirst into a difficulty spike on the third world. Quickly tiring of my inability to make progress, I moved on to other things, but it always kept nagging me in the back of my mind. I knew it was within my abilities, and I even tried to pick it up a couple times in the months afterward, but I was never really able to sink my teeth into it.Five years and an engineering degree later, I decided to revisit my old nemesis. I restarted the game and quickly progressed to the same wall I had hit in the past... and to my surprise, managed to blast through it. And the level after that. And all the way through to the end of the game. And the weirdest thing is I don't really think I'm any better at it now than I was five years ago. I think the difference is perspective.SpaceChem is absolutely a hard game. But I don't think it's hard because you need to be a genius to solve the puzzles. Instead it's hard because it demands lots of time and effort and is uncompromising in its expectations. Unlike other puzzle games, where there's often a eureka moment where you make a vital connection and the rest of the solution falls into place, every inch of progress in stitching your molecules together is hard won. You have to experiment, try different approaches, fail, tweak your designs, and sometimes tear it all down and start over with something completely new to get everything to work.It wasn't until I had worked on real world engineering problems that I truly appreciated what SpaceChem was asking of me. Once I did though, I came to love its challenges. The feeling of looking at a puzzle for the first time and wondering how the hell you're gonna even begin to solve it, then putting the last piece of your crazy contraption into place a few hours later and have the whole thing come together and just *work*... It's incredible. That feeling is what you buy the game for."

It manages to capture the magic of computer programming and make its joys accessible to a wider audience.Let me talk about actual programming for a minute. Programming is 90% problem-solving, 9% frustration, and 1% elation over the feeling of dominance. You start with a goal in mind; creating a program for a specific function. Via problem-solving, you figure out how to tell the computer to do what you want it to do. Once your program is finished, you run it, and find out it doesn't work. That's where the frustration comes in. You tweak your code, you run, it fails again. Lather, rinse, repeat about once per ten lines of code, then...VOILA! IT WORKS! It's a great feeling that I can't possibly describe sufficiently.Spacechem's gameplay follows the exact same process. You start with a goal in mind; taking given input molecules and turning them into given output molecules. Via problem-solving, you figure out how to tell the game what you want it to do. Once your program is finished, you run it and find out something went horribly wrong. You tweak the commands, run it again, fail again, repeat again, until eventually...SUCCESS! YOU ARE WINRAR!

As a lot of people in the reviews will tell you, however, it **is** a game about programming, to an extent. The general flow of the game involves taking a fixed set of inputs and figuring out a specific set of instructions that will produce the desired output for the level. It's an extremely simple approach to puzzle design, but that's where SpaceChem shines. Because every level can generally be described as a brief list of inputs and outputs, puzzles will stick in your mind for long after you step away from the computer, and you can spend a lot of time thinking about solutions wherever you are.Spacechem's greatest, strength, though, is it's difficulty curve. The game does a superb job of introducing an enormous amount of unique mechanics at a rate that makes them feel exciting instead of overwhelming. You always feel like you're playing with a larger set of tools than you had previously, and it rarely feels like too much to handle. That said, the game is far from easy. It takes a lot of real, genuine thought to complete a lot of this game's levels, but the satisfaction that comes from seeing your convoluted series of instructions running in a perfect loop is immensely satisfying.At the end of the day, Spacechem is a puzzle game, and a fairly challenging one.

92800,5,0,76561198084544660,408,22,1,44.8,"August 17, 2014","The most satisfying puzzle game I have ever played. I found the mechanics kinda difficult to grasp at the beginning but the basic principles are fairly easy to understand. Basically, you are building molecules out of atoms (who would have guessed). You start the game with one reactor that has 2 ""circuits"" in it, you can modify shape of these circuits and put different commands on them that will input/output atoms, grab them, bond them together, you can also rotate the molecules and do other stuff with them that I don't know about yet since I am not too far into the game.Later on, you will be given multiple reactors that can all be ""programmed"" separately giving the game a whole new level. For instance, you can have one reactor that will be used to brake bonds between atoms, then it will output them to another reactor that will bond them together with different atoms to form the molecule that you need. Now all of this sounds like you need a degree in chemistry and physics to be able to play the game but that is absolutely not the case. It's all logical, you don't need to know absolutely anything about chemistry or any other science.What some people may dislike about this game is that it ramps up the difficulty fairly quickly but a nice thing is that all the solutions are always saved and you can revisit previous levels to go over the basics again, experiment or improve your designs. Because unlike many other puzzle games where you are merely trying to find the single solution that the developers invented, in Spacechem there are hundreds if not thousands of solutions to every level and there is even online workshop kind of thing where you can download player-created levels and also upload your own (I hope that's what it's for, I have never actually used it :D), giving the game a HUGE replay value. I can imagine sinking hundreds upon hundreds of hours into this.Even though I am not very good at puzzle games and I doubt I will ever finnish this one because the difficulty gets absolutely ridiculous in later levels from what I've seen on youtube, I have to recommend Spacechem. It's extremely original, challenging, satisfying and fun. What more could you possibly ask of a puzzler? It even has a story! I haven't really followed it too much but it's there and sometimes you get a story-related mission like the one I recently got where I had to destroy a giant bulldozer closing in on our base by filling some tanks with methane causing them to explode in it's face!"

Building requires dragging and dropping visual components, a kind of ""visual programming"".  It's a little like ""The Incredible Machine"" in that regard; without the Rube-Goldberg-esque humour, but far more deep and challenging.Any successful design will get you past a level, but if you're like me you'll continually revisit your solutions and try to improve them, by using fewer components, or making more efficient solutions."

It asks you, the player, to be creative and logical, to come up with your own answers for seemingly-intractable problems.  How well you receive the game will depend on how much you enjoy this type of challenge.If you get stuck on the main storyline, your only real recourses are to 1. keep hammering at it, 2. search out a video of how someone else did it for inspiration, or 3. take a break and try some of the side-missions.  These are available in the 'research net' section, and are user-created challenges released periodically.  They can also be undertaken in any order you wish.The only strikes against the game are:  Some features are not fully explained in terms of how they interact, so you have to do a bit of experimentation.  The working space and other limitations can be a real bear in some levels (i.e.. if you just had a bit more room to breathe, it would be a lot less frustrating).  They will frequently introduce some cool new feature in one mission series, show you how to use it, test you on it, then abandon it going forward.  You'll come to a level and think ""ok, I just have to set this up with some switches/sensors/whatever, and I'll be good to..  they took those out?!  WTF!""The defense levels are a little forced, and don't work all that well, in my opinion.As far as procedural puzzlers go, it's top notch."
92800,1,0,brookieoz,78,4,1,314.3,"July 7, 2014","Great indie puzzle game, and without much parallel from what I've seen.There were great puzzles in the actual game, and much more in the researchnet when you've finished the game. There isn't much actual chemistry in the game; it's used more as a basis for the puzzles. The storyline was good, the visuals were fine. The reason why this game stands out is the open-endedness of the puzzles; finding your own solution and improving upon it is the main thrill of this game, and the euphoria of completing a puzzle or optimizing your design to the most efficient possible is where this game gets its fun. There bell curves (usually) in the missions, which tell you how well your solution is compared to others.I've been told that this game is quite similar to programming, which may drive you away or towards this game. I find it more about making a machine and watching it work as it executes commands the way you programmed it.On the other side, I'd say that the graphics in the reactors themselves are rather bland, but I can excuse that as it would become too complex if it weren't bland. I'd prefer if the game had told me what you can do and what you can't do with the molecules (can't collide), and there are some hidden tricks which are not mentioned at all (bonder priority, especially, though particle smashing to a lesser extent as well). The music also may get a bit repetitive (I personally can't get tired of it though).Other than that, this game is quite an amazing puzzle game.

The object of the game is to use two pathways to assemble the atoms of elements in a grid from input to output, essentially programming a machine to create the desired output. This game is only for a certain type of person. If you're not prepared to have your brain explode, or you hate it when you can't get a puzzle right away, I don't recommend this game for you. It's really that hard. Solutions around mid-game will probably take you an hour or two. If you're not very inclined with logic and algorithms you may not like this game. However, even if any of these applied to you, I still think it's worth a buy, if only to experience the difficulty this game features, even so early on. If this kind of puzzler is your cup of tea, then do I have the game for you. Whenever you find a solution to a puzzle, the immense feeling of pride is overwhelming. As you're guiding the elements you'll actually feel like a scientist on a breakthrough project. When you do finally solve a puzzle after hours of planning, you'll want to make it more efficent and quicker than what you already have. You'll want to watch it work in front of you as you admire your handywork. If you enjoy working out difficult problems and like a programming-type style of puzzle then you are this game's audience."

The idea is genius! The design and implementation is good. The story is interesting. Even the menus look good. The boss battles are a very cool idea too. It's just amazing to use the ""boring"" thing like chemical plants to fight enemies. The switches in boss levels made it feel like I was creating a game inside a game (building the ""engine"" and wiring the controls).Liked the additional levels and the online gallery.The not so good parts (there are very few):1) Liked the music, but there's like only a single track. I've spent countless hours and the music got to me a bit.2) Non-gameplay graphics (like the pyramid) are a bit low-res and blurry when viewed on a large monitor.3) I encountered a bug: sometimes when I opened some old completed level, the plant schemes were slightly messed up (any any change breaks everything for good). Guess the save format was a bit unstable. This disn't set me back while I was playing through the game, but I'm a bit of archivist.Overall, this is a great game. I want some more of it.

From an actual chemistry standpoint it doesn't make a hell of a lot of sense, but what's really intriguing is that this takes the essence of programming/circuit design and distills it into a fascinating game.

Unfortunately i cannot play it any more, my mind spins with possible solutions for hours afterwards, keeping me from sleep. It is at heart a programming game, but disguised into chemistry machine building.  In fact you are building a network of mutlithreaded realtime processors. The programming aspect makes this into a ""sandbox"" pussle; you must fulfill the objectives, but there are an infinite amount of ways to do so. Afterwards you get a comparison with others that have played the level, and get to se how well you did versus them. The interesting part of that comparison is that it rates you on both processsing time and design simplicity, and in general you cannot do well in both. This will either leave you with a feeling of that you chose the right optimization or (as in my case) trigger competitive insanity.

I love the little games where you had a pipe of water coming out one side and you needed to channel it to the other side in the right amount of time, or via some complex complication where they shipped to many right bending pipes and not enough left bend pipes… they've always been fun to me.This ends up being a little like that but taken to the extreme.  Labeled fake chemistry, you're tasked with assembling various molecules from their base elements including the number of bonds required to make the molecule.  The puzzlyness (new word!) is excellent.  Receiving two inputs on a reactor, you have you output your end goal.  Eventually, molecules are so complex that you'll need multiple sub combines in different reactors pumped into the other reactors in order to combine the final element.  There's 2 scales of assemble, one where goods are piped into and out of the reactors that to the combinations and then the actual assembly puzzles within the reactors themselves.  When you hit the go switch, the elements are pumped in at a fixed rate and everything must be processed and timed in order to get the right targets out the other end.Hard to explain, fantastic to play.  Easily in my top five of puzzle games of all time.  Hard to find something bad to say about this game apart from it not having much replayability apart from making your designs more efficient.  At the end of every round, you're presented with your cycles to completion and parts used count and are compared globally.  It makes you feel dumb at times and genius at others.  The lack of replay however becomes a bit of a non-issue because there are so many levels/puzzles.This is solid at the $15 level.

To be more precise, your job is to create procedures that assemble those compounds - yes, assemble. It’s not so much a game about chemistry as it is about creating factory lines, or concurrent programs.The concept behind the game is nothing short of brilliant, and I don’t think there’s a single game in the market remotely like it. I was taken by it in the first few hours. After that, however, the difficulty ramped up considerably, and I found myself taking way too long to figure out a single solution.That’s my problem with the game, it’s just too complicated for its own good. You have to spend massive amounts of time on details trying to make the solution work, and forget about the story because of how much time goes by between scenes. It ends up feeling like a job, not a diversion.Sometimes, I wish I could have gotten into it. I admire people who play this game well. In fact, I spent a lot of time at Spacechem.net trying out different solutions for levels, completely taken by how brilliant they were. But I saw no joy in trying to figure them out myself.I guess SpaceChem can be compared to EVE Online in this regard.

Pretty soon, you will find a puzzle that completely stumps you.This game is not for the feint of heart, the puzzles are hard. But since the game operates within a well defined set of rules, you will find yourself thinking of solutions throughout the day. I found myself drawing sketches to solutions that I had brainstormed while at work. Then I'd eagerly wait until the day was over to get home, try out the idea, and refine any issues.

Of course, the parents said it was OK, but the babysitter had one final request… she asked if she could cover up the angel statue outside the bedroom window with a blanket or cloth, at the very least close the blinds, because it made her nervous. The phone line was silent for a moment, and the father who was talking to the babysitter at the time said, ""..Take the children and get out of the house…we will call the police. We do not have an angel statue."" The police found all three of the house occupants dead within ten minutes of the call. No statue was found."

A small learning curve, maybe a bit more for folks that aren't used to logic games (specifically coding-type games).CONCLUSION:It's hard to put the game down when you are trying to beat the records (or at least get close to it).  The game requires a lot of forethought in how you can achieve the solution, and there are many ways to solve each ""puzzle"".  When you see the records, you likely will try to beat it as it isn't satisfying to just solve it.  So, at least for me, I play the same puzzle many times trying to figure out the best possible solution to beat or at least match the top records.  Other than that, the story element is minimal, it is presented as a few descriptive texts between most levels but doesn't really serve much of any other purpose.  You'll quickly forget the game has a story at all.  But I guess that's not really the point of this game.GRADE:8/10"

The depth available to the game has spawned a community that has still not managed to perfect solutions for every level leaving plenty of room for the enterprising chemist to dazzle and impress. In short, if you're looking for a puzzle - this is the game to get. It's fun from the start and only gets better.Do not buy this game if you can't program. Turing completeness makes for some of the most engaging puzzling we will probably ever see in a video game, but it also unfortunately means that I cannot in good faith recommend this title without that massive caveat. The game makes no pretenses about its true nature and the introductory challenges are little more than cues to familiarize yourself with the game's controls and the puzzle mechanics. The experience with the demo version is only a portion of what the game has to offer: a lack of confidence in tackling the game's challenges will frustrate you and copying other people's solutions will leave you with no understanding or appreciation of the game."

The game challenges the player to come up with the most elegant solution (using the least amount of resources). Being an IT engineer, when I first watched the tutorial video, admittedly I thought in my head ""oh great, this is going to be like my job"" and while the gameplay does remind me a little bit like writing code, it was actually surprisingly fun. The game's overall presentation is nice, somewhat simple but it's tastefully done. The music is good, although at times it made feel like I'm watching a movie from the 90s. The pacing of the game is well done; the player is sanely and graciously introduced to game elements. The game's design allows for any number of solutions and after solving a problem the player is presented with a bell curve as to how they compared to ""other engineers"" (ie players). I really appreciated this aspect as it let me know that a more efficent and elegant solution is possible. My only complaint with the game is that it actually did feel a bit like my job (but in a good way). The feeling of satisfation I got from completing a puzzle was similiar to the satisfaction I get when writing a piece of code I'm proud of at work. It's a good feeling but by the end of the day I'm usually more keen on relaxation instead of solving complex problems.Overall this game is nicely designed and definitely worth consideration.

Entering a DRM key with extremely tiny letters into a text field with no arrow key support (you can't go back and change a letter if you get one wrong, you have to delete everything and start over) is not a good way to start a fun game. Eventually I got it working, and I soon wished I hadn't.In a nutshell, this game is too simple in the action department, and too complex in the how-to-play department. I'll admit, I enjoy a good action game, but if a puzzler is done right, I can waste plenty of hours on it. This game, however, was just too boring. I didn't care who the hero was, I didn't care why he needed to move circles (molecules) around, the game just did not motivate me to move past the first few levels.Basically, if you like dragging and dropping shapes onto other shapes, you'll like this game.

It is a well crafted puzzle game that encourages creativity in its solutions.In this game, there is a grid.  On this grid, you will place molecules, you will move molecules, and you will export specific, predetermined molecules.  The catch is, you have to do so by constructing a machine in advance, and then let it solve the problem for you.  Making such a machine is not easy, and it is rare that it will work as expected the first time.  The ""machine"" as I described it is composed of two tracks, with instructions along them.  A disc, which the game calls a WALDO, travels along each track, following the instructions as it comes across them.  The instructions include making an input molecule appear, making an output molecule disappear, grabbing/dropping a molecule, and bonding two molecules together.There are many ways to beat each level.  Some are more efficient than others.  The great thing about this is that it encourages you to replay old levels to try to find the most optimized way of beating them.  You get to compare the efficiency of your solutions to the solutions of others.  This is probably the hardest puzzle game I've ever played (I still haven't beaten it, even on the iPad), but it is definitely the most satisfying.  There's a real joy when your contraption finally comes together and works as planned.  And the challenge is such that it ultimately feels fair.  There's always a ""best"" way to do it, but whatever you can come up with, so long as it gets the job done, is acceptable.If you want a challenging, well made game that encourages creative solutions to puzzles, then look no further than this game."

While it is a puzzle game, it is nothing like the popular puzzle games out now (e.g. bejeweled and its many clones). The game looks like it should appeal to Chemists, but the people that seem to enjoy and do well in this game are typically software/electrical engineers, computer scientists, mathematicians, and the like. The underlying link seems to be an understanding of programing logic to some extent. (I'm sure there are people that play and enjoy the game that haven't had a lick of programming experience, but I haven't seen many.) Indeed, the chemistry mechanic of the game is secondary and extremely questionable in terms of the reality of it. While I really enjoy this game, there is a *sharp* learning curve. The tutorials can only teach you so much. This again reminds me of computer programing: you can know the basics, but that does not prepare you for the mental exercise of working out a complex challenge. That being said, there are few games that have given me the feeling of accomplishment and pride when I finally work out a solution."

It's a fiendish and quite unique puzzle game that has you manipulating atoms and assembling molecules inside special reactors. The process of engineering the assembly lines, however, resembles the usage of a visual programming language. A friend of mine said that if you have any spark of a programmer inside of you, you will love this game. I agree with him. The 'language' that the Spacechem reactors use may be somewhat limited, but that's what forms much of the challenge of the game.And I mean it when I say it's fiendish. The tutorials are more akin to guidelines, and they don't tell you some of the tricks you will probably end up needing, meaning that self-discovery plays a fairly large role. Fortunately enough, the solutions are open-ended - seeing your solution work provides much of the satisfaction of the game. That's why if you get stuck (and you will probably get stuck a fair amount), it's best to find hints, go back to earlier levels to try and find inspiration from them or simply take a break.Anyway. Surprisingly for a puzzle game, it has a pretty good story, killer music and Team Fortress 2 promotional items. You'll need to use TF2's advanced crafting to make them, and you need to solve three puzzles to gain all the crafting ingredients you need. It's a pretty remarkable implementation, perhaps one of the most remarkable out of all of TF2's promos."

92800,0,0,flayer_1,976,79,1,14.8,"February 10, 2013","SpaceChem is a masterpiece. The challenge here is to create specific chemical compounds by rearranging the atomic structure of the given compound(s) and delivering them to the destination through a pipes. You accomplish this using a series of reactors which can add, remove or re-arrange the atoms of a compound: each of these is a puzzle in and of itself. Deciding how many and which type of reactor to use in each level provides a sort of macro puzzle. Many levels limit the type and/or number or reactors available, providing variety in addition to aesthetic and compound differences. You can save and load reactor layouts, allowing you to use them in different levels.Each level is so brilliantly complex in that you are not only trying to construct the most efficient way to modify the compounds within each reactor, you must also consider the overall purpose of each reactor in sequence: given that most compounds require several different reactors to change them into the desired result. Additionally (yes, there is more: bear with me, it will be worth it!), each level must be completed within a certain time frame or 'cycles'. Transporting each compound from the start to the destination takes time, as does modifying them through each reactor. If not designed efficiently, you may end up with bottlenecks in your chain of reactors, leading to the overall level time being too slow. This is usually fixed through some minor tweaking and provides another level of strategic planning to the each levels.I found the muisic to be quite enjoyable and the astheic both functional and pleasing to look at. There is an overacrching story, which is told between levels. It is very well written, and quite interesting. I fear however, that I will never see the end of the story, due to my own incompetence and to the sheer complexity and intricacy of the puzzles."

Nothing else short of possibly Deadly Rooms of Death can compare to its depth of play while still retaining its simple foundations.SpaceChem is also dastardly tricky.  Most everyone else I know who's played it had to stop because it just got too difficult.  For some levels, I can understand that feeling.  The difficulty curve has spikes in it.  In the end though, I think it's definitely worth it.  The feeling of accomplishment you get is not just from beating the puzzles, but from your own personal solution to them.  You made this design that completed the task set in front of you.  It's yours, every single part of it.There are very few games that can evoke that sort of deeply personal satisfaction.

Sure, stylistically it is pretty basic, but the puzzles in this game are so well designed it's almost frustrating!  After just a few really simple ones to get your feet wet, the puzzles quickly get complex and require a great deal of planning.  You would think breaking apart molecules and using the atoms to create new ones would not be so challenging, but it really is given your limited resources.There are a few interface issues I wish were a little smoother, but since you can completely control how fast the game moves, it's not a big deal.  You'll be too busy trying to figure out how to break off 4 atoms and combine 3 others to create two separate outputs with just 4 bond zones to care about it.SpaceChem is pretty much the ultimate mind teaser  for spacial awareness.

The UI is clear, it allows for player documentation of your state machines, and tries to give you the tools to come up with the best solution possible.

You use a set of simple, visual programming commands to build a machine to change inputs into new outputs.  It starts simple, but the complexity builds quickly.   The small set of commands are easy to understand and the levels are designed well to introduce each new action in turn with a relatively simple puzzle before asking you to combine it with previous commands in complex ways.A successful solution isn't necessarily the end of that level if you prefer.  At the end of a solution, you are presented with your ranking against the averages of others based on things like how long your solution took, or how many commands you used.  You can continue the gameplay by working to optimize your solution.Who will like this game?Programmers, engineers, fans of games like Incredible Machine, or people who like making crazy automatic things in Minecraft.  Lego builders who ignore directions.The Good:Lots of puzzle variety in the main game, plus a whole integrated set of puzzles that are online.  Histograms allow you to work to refine designs for different goals in each level allowing for good replay value on each puzzleThe Bad:It's hard.  Very few people actually complete all the puzzles in the game (which has been noted by the developer).

While that premise seems simple, the application of it varies in difficulty; each level ranges from easy to brain-stompingly difficult. And there are quite a few levels. The game contains something like eight different planets, each with at least five different puzzles to solve. The story, delivered solely through written narratives every few levels, gives one a sense of two things: one, that something's not quite right in Vossler Industries; and two, that there are big things going on to prevent knowledge of the prior. As I write this, it's on sale for only $2.49. If you enjoy puzzle games of any kind, even ranging back to Tetris, this game is a must-have.

As a programmer, I enjoyed the element of breaking down the problems into programmatic algorithms - you must think like a programmer in order to succeed at this game, taking into consideration if/else, basic logic, input/output, and step-by-step requirements to get from point A to point B.You don't have to be a programmer, or a chemist, or a biologist. You do need to have patience and a solid grasp of logic and sequence. Some of the puzzles, I believe, are a bit too much, taking too much time and effort. It would be nice if you had a limited set of 'skips' that you can use to skip over problematic problems. However, I do believe that the balance of difficulty is spot on.The learning curve is gradual; however, the difficulty of the puzzles increases sharply. This game requires you to think outside the box (and not just one box, but multiple boxes at the same time). This is not a bad thing; in fact, this is exactly what I expect to find in a puzzle game. Not only that, but this game has some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥' music. I also like the fact that they added a story to the game, and there are various 'missions' that are different than the basic 'solve this puzzle' scenario.

For example, you might have a level where your inputs are water and chlorine gas, and you want to convert that to oxygen gas and hydrochloric acid.

Process optimization, design problems, spatial layout, programming, continuous flow problems.

Difficulty ramps up very quickly.There is no ""one way"" to solve a task, the general idea is that you program the reactors to perform a goal. As long as the job gets done, it still counts. However efficiency and speed does result in higher ranks on the leaderboard.In tasks, you are limited by the number of programmable reactors you can use, and indeed the notion of limited space is real catch. If you run out of reactors or diagram space, you'll need to find a way to optimize your layout. I've been programming for many years and these puzzles itch the same portion of the brain. I suppose it's analgous to trying to write a program in 256 bytes of assembler.Unlike many puzzle games, this one fits into a context that makes sense, the story line and the objectives you complete don't seem forced or fanciful.

I don't know if it gets added in a later level or not (I'm about halfway through the third world now), but this game REALLY needs a hint system. The amount of complexity can be overwhelming and one mistimed reaction or misplaced pipe can lead to compounding failure and rage.

Maybe!No real chemistry involved here; it's basically visual scripting with a limited set of ""instructions"" (tools) and a geometric aspect. If you like coding/scripting, or if you like building contraptions and watching them crank along, then you'll probably dig it. It does quickly get complex. This is not an easy game. Fortunately the solving process doesn't (always) involve just staring at the screen, but rather building different aspects of a possible solution to see how they work out. So it's engaging even when you're not immediately solving stuff.The nifty thing is that each problem has lots of workable solutions. If you like, you can tune your solutions for efficiency or speed, and see how you compare to other players. I'm only halfway through the campaign myself, just taking my time and occasionally going back to earlier stages to tweak my solutions.You can see some solution examples at spacechem.net or on youtube."

On the other hand, if you love the afforementioned titles, then by all means, do indulge in a puzzlegame based on pure logic and exact science. Incredibly deep and massively engaging, Spacechem's systems and background mechanics will make your brain work like a well oiled V12 engine. In spacechem you have to program a nuclear reactor and assemble, or crack atoms. And that is just the entry level, when you get to einstein level, you have combine your atoms with more atoms, think about bindings, and load them into freighters. While making one compound is a walk in the proverbial park. You have to make make a pattern that is infintely repeatable...on all levels. Making that walk in the park a bloody streetfight in a volcano...in space."

The learning curve is pretty steep, but the tutorials give you a good staring point. If you don't like using your brain, I cannot recommend this game.

92800,13,2,666CleM666,416,66,1,106.4,"May 28, 2020","In today's seemingly distant two thousand and eleventh year, the little-known studio Zachtronics Industries released the game SpaceChem, which can literally be translated as Space Chemistry. What happens infrequently, the name completely conveys the essence: we have to do chemistry in space (not in the open, of course, but not on Earth) as a young engineer, namely, to program processes in molecular reactors, and sometimes even build small production complexes .I think, already at this moment it becomes clear that SpaceChem is not an action, not a quest or even a graphic novel, SpaceChem is a very harsh and hardcore puzzle, but first things first. Let's start with the plot.He is, and meets us with the phrase ""You know, people die in space"", which sets the general tone for the whole story. The plot here is essentially a medium-sized short story that connects levels and reveals a classic parable about the menacing majesty of the unknown and the fragility of the person who encounters this unknown. Pretty pleasant reading, framed by small sketches. But the salt of the game is far from history. It's time to talk about the gameplay itself.Most of the time, the player watches a ten-by-eight board. On this board, he programs two lines - red and blue. When the reactor starts, manipulators start running along the lines, which, when passing through the cells marked by the player, perform various actions - they capture and throw, connect, rotate molecules of various substances (new teams appear later). The goal is to obtain molecules of other substances from the molecules of some substances that appear in the left half of the reactor through transfers and transformations, and then send them to the right half. And you need to program the reaction scheme so that it runs for several tens of cycles. It seems to me that it is rather difficult to describe game mechanics clearly, or I just can’t do this, so I’ll give a small analogy.The gameplay of SpaceChem is like solving a problem in a technical subject: computer science, physics, geometry, and the like. There is a clearly stated condition. There is a certain device that allows you to perform various operations. And most importantly, there is room for creativity. The gameplay of most games of this genre is to find the answer conceived by the authors. Here, there is no clear-cut framework for how to solve the proposed problem. Most of the SpaceChem levels can be completed in dozens, if not hundreds of different ways, and the emotions from the next successfully completed reaction are the same as from finding a solution to the very system of diffours that has been haunting for a couple of days.The emphasized cold and minimalistic design just creates the feeling that I'm sorry, you didn’t come here to be entertained, but to engage in a business that requires a serious approach and concentration. In the stages with the construction of chemical plants, the game becomes even more complicated, forcing you to think in a slightly different plane and decide for yourself which molecules and in what order to load into the reactors, laying piping systems and choosing where to place the reactors.It is impossible not to mention the complexity. With a sufficiently high entry threshold, SpaceChem does not slow down throughout its entire length and constantly throws up increasingly complex and more non-trivial tasks, and at the end brazenly selects nights spent trying to at least find the right course of the reaction. A sort of Dark Souls puzzle world.In conclusion, I note that everyone who wants to stretch their brains loves games of this genre, interesting tasks and severe challenges, SpaceChem is simply recommended, unless of course you have heard of it before. The rest, I believe, does not make much sense to get acquainted with this game, and the plot can be read on the Internet."

The clear rate is under 5% and I'll bet if I could see the stats on this game, 50% of players that start it up don't spend more than 30 minutes playing it.  At first I wanted to say it's because this game is hard, or at least climbs too steeply in difficulty.  But really it's just overwhelmingly obtuse in how it presents its data to the player, the bonding system only just barely makes sense and the input/output system take about an hour to understand by themselves.  Either way, what this means is most of those players are too embarressed to come back here and tell you they aren't smart enough to get more than a couple of hours through this game.  I'm getting old though, I don't give a care, this game is too hard by half, and flip a coin that's your odds of playing this for more than 30 minutes.  I can't recommend a game like that."
