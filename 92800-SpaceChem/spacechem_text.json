Well worth getting I recon.","This will hurt your brain.","A decent puzzle game based around the basic principles of chemistry, thankfully with enough deus ex machina technology involved to not require a degree. It has enough pacing that you don't get bored or feel overwhelmed, although the game is most certainly for the logical and patient. As I am neither, the intermediate levels are currently absolutely skull-f**king me.","A game that achieves the surprisingly entertaining combination of visual programming and ridiculous chemistry, Spacechem is well worth trying if the initial part of this sentence made any amount of sense to you.","This is a pretty neat puzzle game. It has a lot of logic and timing to it. For some reason, I think it would appeal to programmers. I love it, even if it can be -ass hard at times. Which is what makes it all the sweeter when a level is finally solved. There's a demo, check it out...","Addictive game. Especially fun if you are into programming.","Puzzle game of the year?  Maybe!No real chemistry involved here; it's basically visual scripting with a limited set of \"instructions\" (tools) and a geometric aspect. If you like coding\/scripting, or if you like building contraptions and watching them crank along, then you'll probably dig it. It does quickly get complex. This is not an easy game. Fortunately the solving process doesn't (always) involve just staring at the screen, but rather building different aspects of a possible solution to see how they work out. So it's engaging even when you're not immediately solving stuff.The nifty thing is that each problem has lots of workable solutions. If you like, you can tune your solutions for efficiency or speed, and see how you compare to other players. I'm only halfway through the campaign myself, just taking my time and occasionally going back to earlier stages to tweak my solutions.You can see some solution examples at spacechem.net or on youtube.","SpaceChem is a really fun puzzle game! If you love making some fake science with a couple of puzzle solving, then this game is for you!","The puzzle game that makes you feel smart and stupid at the same time!","You have to have at least a dual-core brain to keep up with this puzzle game. If you meet those minimum requirements, it's very enjoyable and actually feels rewarding as you're solving each of the increasingly-difficult, multi-layered, pipelining problems. The music is also top-notch and fits in perfectly for what could be hours spent on one puzzle alone.This game highly promotes the unique way each individual can tackle a specific problem, and I can't really accurately describe my thoughts right on how it feels when you actually solve a problem that's personally challenging - sometimes wiping the slate clean multiple times to try to see it from a different angle; but it feels good at the very least - sometimes even cathartic.","Easily the cleverest puzzle game of the last decade. It also has a belting soundtrack.","That's some mind bending puzzles right there","Melts your brain. In a good way.","WOW","Best puzzle game ever.","A game for engineers, but you could love it if you are one :).","A surprisingly simple becomes very complex puzzle game.   If you (like me) like problems that take timing and planning ahead 10-20 steps as well as sandbox like construction buy it Noaw!","Great for anyone who likes to use more than a fraction of their brain power.","Highly addictive and will ruin your sleeping pattern.","This is a really solid science-y puzzle game. Try the demo!","This game is mind-numbingly awesome.  Six Flags has a rollercoaster called \"The Mind Eraser\".  This game is what they mean.  Aaaaaawwwwwsome!!!!!","If you thought Portal 2 had challenging puzzles, or if you get scared at the thought of Tetris, then by all means, stay clear of Spacechem. On the other hand, if you love the afforementioned titles, then by all means, do indulge in a puzzlegame based on pure logic and exact science. Incredibly deep and massively engaging, Spacechem's systems and background mechanics will make your brain work like a well oiled V12 engine. In spacechem you have to program a nuclear reactor and assemble, or crack atoms. And that is just the entry level, when you get to einstein level, you have combine your atoms with more atoms, think about bindings, and load them into freighters. While making one compound is a walk in the proverbial park. You have to make make a pattern that is infintely repeatable...on all levels. Making that walk in the park a bloody streetfight in a volcano...in space.","Great If you like really hard puzzles, better if you like chemistry (though not required, as its not realistic to chemistry). Also its in Space. Its not so great if you like your brain to not melt XD. Puzzles are very rewarding when you complete them though :D","Spacechem is a very challenging but simple game in which you design algorithms in order to get inputs a & b to outputs a & b. Get ready to lose 5 hours while slowly optimizing your design and then feeling like an idiot when you see that you're 2000 cycles behind your friends.","I am an alchemist, I am an automatist. My eyes and fingertips become fountains of light and my chair tips back, rises into the air, and careens off into a field of darkness and light, where I can taste the sticky bittersweet of solid electricity and feel my blood turn to gasoline. Suddenly I am struck with a divine inspiration, calling to me from beyond the infinite, and I roar in a pain most exquisite; its voice resonates with mine and then every force of space and time becomes prostrate at my feet.SpaceChem.","If you like puzzle games, and aren't afraid of a challenge, this is a must have.","Absolutely fantastic puzzle game, very open ended, many solutions to even the hardest puzzles.","Take a precautionary step to prevent Alzheimer's - Buy this game!!","A good puzzle game, although it can get VERY complex. If you love puzzle games, though, it's definitely worth checking out.","Possibly the hardest game ever.","Chemistry meets computer science! Or something silly like that. It's an engineering game, so not for everyone, but fun and complex ^_^","Extremely challenging.","Nice programming type of game. very unique and puzzly. Also writing a recommendation for it gives you a ticket for the summer sale ;)","addictive, fun and very difficult.","Hardcore puzzling.","Crazy visual programming game","A game for engineers, but you could love it if you are one :).","SpaceChem has the potential to become synonymous with hard. Not hard like insane action game hard, oh no, this is perhaps even more intense. Bond molecules, break molecules, form new molecules and output them from the reactor. Then when you think that's all there is to it, you zoom out and realise there's sometimes more than one reactor! The learning curve is pretty steep, but the tutorials give you a good staring point. If you don't like using your brain, I cannot recommend this game. If you do though, then get your thinking caps on because we're going to do some chemistry!Disclaimer: Chemistry not actually real. Don't try breaking strong bonds at home. Free atoms can (and probably will) cause nausea, hearing loss, pain, death, and even explosions. Not for the faint at heart.","Try it. It'll make you feel really smart AND really stupid.","If you black out and wake up to find that your file's been advanced through the game, don't worry. This is the intended method of clearing most levels.","Stupidly addictive little puzzler, worth every cent.","This game definitely puts the achieve back into achievements... fairly simple to understand, fiendishly difficult to complete, and just when you've finished a level you get hit with the average online performance showing you did the worst possible solution.. A small, basic, low-budget puzzler aimed at visually programming solutions, unquestionably the most cerebral game I've ever seen but still massively addictive.","A fantastic puzzle game, mostly for people who like programming, but others should also enjoy it. At the start of most puzzles it will make you feel like the most moronic person that has ever lived, at the end of it, you feel like a genius. Then you see your score compared to others and you feel like a moron again.I am radomaj and I approve this recommendation.","Nice programming type of game. very unique and puzzly.

Attempt to create molecules that match what you need to output. Starts easy, gets deviously hard as you try and work out the programming tricks.Highly reccomend.","This game challenges you in ways that many other games don't - by actually making you think through the level you're solving. You'll have a damned hard time solving some of the levels presented in this game, but when you do solve it, the feeling is the same as when you have just finished putting together an awesome LEGO set. And then you can try to optimize your solution.The only downside is that, sometimes, the interface will get a little cluttered, especially if you have many reactors going at the same time. However, the clutter didn't stop you from playing with LEGOs, did it?","Sort of like super meat boy using your brain instead of your thumbs, painfully hard to get the best scores but you can't stop trying.","Very impressive logistical\/mechanical\/logic-based puzzle game; each challenge is a mix of building a route, building a machine, and building a program all in one. The production challenges linking several boards (reactors) together to work toward an end result give it a level of freedom and satisfaction I've never seen in a puzzle game before.It has more in common with building a road network in simcity or warehouse network in a trading sim than navigating a maze, pulling levers in the correct order, or rearranging blocks. You're given an input and are challenged to reach an output, but you're given a lot of tools and freedom to get there how you like. Check out the demo if It sounds interesting. Highly recommended.","This game challenges you in ways that many other games don't - by actually making you think through the level you're solving.

There's usually more than one way to solve every level; you can sacrifice speed for efficiency, or vice versa, but you aren't penalized for doing either.  A great pickup if you're looking for a brain-bender.","You think SpaceChem looks boring. I would know; I thought it looked boring years ago and you think exactly like me. That's why I was pleasantly surprised to find out that it is a work of genius. One of the most fiendishly complex and satisfying puzzle games I've ever played.","This game is tied with Picross and Guru Logic Champ for my favorite puzzle game of all time. Absolutley fantastic brain burner.","Thsi is a seriously brain-busting game, but I still found it easier to grasp than their previous effort, the Codex of Alchemical Engineering. It has a lot of subtleties and all kinds of different solutions you can apply to the puzzles, all they require is sufficient application of fake chemical engineering.Atomic manipulation! Giant eldritch monsters! Moustachium! \/SCIENCE!!\/Get it.","If you like puzzle games and or chemistry, you will probably like this.","Spacechem is more about problem solving than puzzle solving -- a subtle, but important distinction. If you are a programmer or any other profession that thinks in logic and flowcharts, this will be right up your alley... if it doesn't feel too much like work, that is.","Don't be fooled by the game's classification as \"casual\". The puzzles in it can be brain-breakingly difficult, and some of them - such as \"Nothing Works\" and \"No Ordinary Headache\" - aptly describe just how difficult these puzzles can be.Despite that, though, it's fan entertaining little game - a tad frustrating at times, but nothing quite beats the satisfaction of finally solving one of those really knotty problems . . . at least, not until you run into the next one!","Really awesome puzzle game that will leave your head banging on the keyboard due to the sheer amount of complexity of the problems to solve.","Guaranteed to make your head hurt, but still worth it :P","This game is half maddening, half amazing. You're given a simple set of tools, that have some very basic applications in the begging. Very quickly, more and more complex puzzles are put forth and you find yourself on a steep learning curve that is immensely rewarding. Not for the faint of heart, but a lot of fun.","It's about programming state machines to do fake chemistry and it feels like working, but it's also an addictive puzzle game.  I spend far too long optimizing my solutions once each level is complete.","Best puzzle game I've ever played, so simple but so deep. Only downside is it sometimes feels like work, but when playing it, I often find myself dreaming up solutions to puzzles at night.","Frustrating?  Yes.  Fun?  Absolutely!  SpaceChem may not be for everyone, but if you can wrap your head around what's going on, you'll find it satisfying to come up with the solutions - or see if you can improve upon what you've already solved.","Very different, but causes you to think..which is something more people need to do more often : )","Best puzzle game for many a long year...","This game has made me want to punch my monitor out of frustration. It has caused me to reach for a pen and paper to work out fusion calculations. It has made me stare, blindly, listening to the soothing music, trying to bend my head around Wallies (because  Waldo, seriously) and lines and the coloured mishmash that coats the matt black of the reaction chamber.And for that, I  love it. A legitimately difficult puzzle game with interesting mechanics and an interesting story to tide you in between missions.","This is the funnest math problem you will ever play.","Really complex puzzle game.  Good for people who like programming and spatial reasoning.","Al Quaida Employee's training simulator.","Awesome game","Holy mother of god, this game is AMAZING. Screw Professor Layton, this puzzle game is the real mind-bender. Great puzzles, great music, incredibly easy to run, and the TF2 items are actually very hard to get. Fantastic for anyone willing to bust a few brain cells.","Pretty interesting concept. You need to build Atoms\/Molecules out of other atoms\/molecules by breaking\/creating atomic bonds and using fission\/fusion to combine atoms together to get the desired result. You do this by \"programming\" the reactor to do certain actions. Sometimes, multiple reactors are required. Some solutions are simple, others not so much. At the end of each level you get statistics on how many cycles\/reactors\/symbols used to get the final result, and it gives a graphics comparing you to your friends and others in general. Overall, the game is pretty fun and addictive.","I love this puzzler. It's clever, logical, very well executed, with an amazingly polished interface... it's also hard. Damn hard. Silicone-carbine-scraping-on-diamond hard. It will make you weep bitter tears. It's all about tinkering, but tinkering alone won't get you anywhere... you have to have a plan. Preferably, a good one. If you like difficult but rewarding logic puzzles, this is a game you need to check out.","Challenging puzzle game; highly recommended","Its too good...","A mind-bending, production-line-esque game of rearranging, bonding, and tearing apart molecules. Fantastic indie game. :)","This game makes me realize I am not nearly as smart as I think I am."],["This is the greatest puzzle game... of all time!  Once you get past the fact that it uses the real periodic table of elements and real valence numbers, it is so freaking satisfying to complete your machine and start cranking out those space chemicals.","This puzzle game doesn't force you to think like the developer. There isn't a single right answer and the game encourages you to improve your solutions.","Finishing a level in SpaceChem is as intellectually satisfying as curing cancer would be. I love this game. Buy it, stick through the frustration and learn to love how much it hates you.","This is a good puzzle game that will blow your mind!","Absolutely awesome puzzle game. Some puzzles seem daunting at first but are really fun to figure out how to piece them together. It's also really fun to try and optimize your machines to run the fasters\/with fewest instructions.Also, any computer scientist should be reminded of turing machines while playing :P","This lets you build machines that create awesomeness."],["A quite difficult but satisfying production line puzzle game. Spacechem has such clever pacing and replayability you will certainly get value for your money until you reach the glass ceiling. The menus are well done and the fake chemistry and story is interesting and will likely most appeal to programmers.","I expected SpaceChem to be a cerebral game, and it delivered. What I didn't expect was for it to be so damned hard. I'm only about 25% through the missions, and some of them take an hour or more to complete. Finishing the game will an 80 hour task.SpaceChem is fun, if you like logic and programming puzzles. I'm hesitant to recommend it, because I know many people won't enjoy this. I think, though, that if you like this kind of game, you know who you are, and you'll find SpaceChem to be both entertaining and deliciously unforgiving.There are some nice non-game features, like leaderboards, in-game video recording (for Youtube!) and creating forum signatures based on your progress. One side effect of the videos, though, is that people seem to be looking up solutions on Youtube and duplicating them. You can tell by looking at the leadersboards. Why would anyone play this way? I dunno.Anyway, I won't be finishing this soon, but I won't be uninstalling it, either!","The hardest puzzle game I've played in recent memory. There are loads of puzzles to do so there's no shortage of content. However it's more a matter of how much you can stomach playing. All the puzzles require you to start from scratch without hints (after the tutorial maps) and get increasingly complex, with more gameplay components being added every few maps. I don't know if it gets added in a later level or not (I'm about halfway through the third world now), but this game REALLY needs a hint system. The amount of complexity can be overwhelming and one mistimed reaction or misplaced pipe can lead to compounding failure and rage. Many times I have spent 30mins-1hr on a puzzle only to start over from scratch.I recommend this if you enjoy puzzle games, but prepared to visit youtube for solutions. A nice feature included is a built-in youtube recorder and uploader to show off your own solutions too so they are easy to find."],["Easily the best Puzzle game I've ever played.On each level the player is required to *create* a solution rather than just find the way the developers intended  like in many puzzle games.  This makes the gameplay compelling and rewarding because each solution is very much the player's own.The game is seriously challenging too, starting off with some easy levels so you get the hang of things, but quickly ramping up to missions that require complex solutions that actually take planning and ingenuity. For puzzle fans the game is well worth its normal price tag.  For everone else, at least try out the demo; the demo in itself is a decent length and will definitely make you decide whether this game is for you or not."],["I think this game caters to a specific type of gamer, but check out the demo and see if you like it. It's a logic puzzler at its core, and you can also go down the extreme optimization path as well. Don't let the apparent molecular\/chemistry bend turn you off, it really has nothing to do with chemistry when it comes down to it.

New mechanics are introduced gradually. Difficulty ramps up very quickly.There is no \"one way\" to solve a task, the general idea is that you program the reactors to perform a goal. As long as the job gets done, it still counts. However efficiency and speed does result in higher ranks on the leaderboard.In tasks, you are limited by the number of programmable reactors you can use, and indeed the notion of limited space is real catch. If you run out of reactors or diagram space, you'll need to find a way to optimize your layout. I've been programming for many years and these puzzles itch the same portion of the brain. I suppose it's analgous to trying to write a program in 256 bytes of assembler.Unlike many puzzle games, this one fits into a context that makes sense, the story line and the objectives you complete don't seem forced or fanciful. And watching a completed system in action is highly rewarding.","I was looking at games the other day. Figured Id support the Indie scene and whats this? SpaceChem? Okay, that looks like something Id enjoy. Turns out I was disastrously right. Heres why:SpaceChem is a training tool for many of the skills I value.  Process optimization, design problems, spatial layout, programming, continuous flow problems. It fits snugly in my mind.There is no right solution (just like in real life!), only better, worse, and wrong.I find SpaceChem really difficult. Theres a constant struggle to create a linked sequence of elegant solutions to unique process challenges.I think Im good at it. Judging from the others solutions charts (which is a brilliant idea by the way) Im coming in below average (which is good, since they are all minimize optimal) on all three metrics at once. Consistently. Often on the first try. Of course, this only drives me to attempt ever more elegant solutions, making the game even more challenging."],["This game is EPIC. The challenge is to program reactors with a series of tracks and commands that will produce a specific molecular result. It's far more complicated then it sounds and you have to think on many levels and try to perform the tasks efficiently and in a multitasking manner with the waldos (grabber\/activators) that reside in each reactor. One reactor is hard enough, but try stringing together several and producing 2 or more different results to send to different freighters. This is definetly a programmer's game as the system seems remeniscent of a programmable processor that manipulates data and seperates the results to specific outputs. An instant favorite of mine, I'll never tire of looking for the most efficient and effective way to produce the desired output.","This is a really good puzzle game!"],["A little tricky to figure it out at first, but once you do this game is an awesome puzzle game.

Then I shave off a few things, make it a bit more elegant and feel even smarter.And that, perhaps, is the most brilliant part of this game: you want to go back, making an even better solution. I'd equate it with programming. Even if you code a solution you always think that you might be able to tweak it just a bit, nip off a line here and a line there. That is this game.

Eventually, the puzzles become a lot more complex - the one that sticks out in my mind is a boss battle where you are given an infinite supply of water and told to make rocket fuel and plutonium. A later one that has you manufacturing ruby crystals (or a molecule I'm told is supposed to be one) for a laser.That said, it's really rewarding to manage something so complex. -- tl;dr: Puzzles that are hard but not impossibly so.

Mind bending","This game starts out fairly simple, but quickly becomes challenging as new concepts are introduced.  At its core, it's a computer-programming game wrapped up in a layer that's somewhere in between chemical engineering and alchemy.  The majority of the gameplay involves designing reactors, where various chemicals are deconstructed and reassembled at the atomic level.  For example, you might have a level where your inputs are water and chlorine gas, and you want to convert that to oxygen gas and hydrochloric acid.  So, you have to figure out how to give instructions to your automated \"waldos\" to disassemble the input molecules and reassemble them into the desired outputs.

That's about it.  Yet once you are into the game you are turning sea water and air into complex compounds.  You are filtering dirty water to power nuclear weapons.  While you are doing it you are also learning the fundamentals of modern programming and Chemistry.  It is one of those rare gems that will engage parts of your brain that you have probably forgotten exist, and at the same time leave you feeling immensely proud of your own creativity.  It is not flash.  It is not action packed.  But damn it is satisfying.","Educational, entertaining, challenging, and almost real chemistry puzzle game.

The UI is clear, it allows for player documentation of your state machines, and tries to give you the tools to come up with the best solution possible.  This is one of those games where the leaderboards matter and trying to eek out that little bit of optimization to get the fastest machine of your friends is something I spent a lot of time doing, even after \"solving\" the problem.","I can't recommend SpaceChem to everyone, but for those with a background or interest in science, particularly chemical reactions, or for those who like trying to find the most efficient solution for puzzles that have many possible solutions, it's definitely worth checking out. The early tutorials fall a little short which makes getting into the game more difficult, but once you get the hang of it the gameplay is very addicting. It's especially satisfying to complete a puzzle, then think up an even better solution that takes a completely different approach.Individual challenges can be completed in 15 minutes or less and can be saved when partially complete, so the game is good for quick breaks and doesn't demand a lot of time (though you can easily lose hours absorbed in it as well).","If you like having no clue what you're doing, get this.","Nifty game which can re-teach you some aspects of chemestry you no doubt forgot!","SpaceChem is compelling, like a gun put to your head telling you to have more fun than you've ever had before solving puzzles by creating molecule factories and designing algorithms to build molecules.

You construct assembly lines to make molecules out of atoms (or other molecules). While that premise seems simple, the application of it varies in difficulty; each level ranges from easy to brain-stompingly difficult. And there are quite a few levels. The game contains something like eight different planets, each with at least five different puzzles to solve. The story, delivered solely through written narratives every few levels, gives one a sense of two things: one, that something's not quite right in Vossler Industries; and two, that there are big things going on to prevent knowledge of the prior. As I write this, it's on sale for only $2.49. If you enjoy puzzle games of any kind, even ranging back to Tetris, this game is a must-have. It will bend your neurons until they ache, but, with perseverance, they will emerge honed, and you will leave with a sense of accomplishment.","Great puzzle game, a little different from others.

Design solutions to problems.  You use a set of simple, visual programming commands to build a machine to change inputs into new outputs.  It starts simple, but the complexity builds quickly.   The small set of commands are easy to understand and the levels are designed well to introduce each new action in turn with a relatively simple puzzle before asking you to combine it with previous commands in complex ways.A successful solution isn't necessarily the end of that level if you prefer.  At the end of a solution, you are presented with your ranking against the averages of others based on things like how long your solution took, or how many commands you used.  You can continue the gameplay by working to optimize your solution.Who will like this game?Programmers, engineers, fans of games like Incredible Machine, or people who like making crazy automatic things in Minecraft.  Lego builders who ignore directions.The Good:Lots of puzzle variety in the main game, plus a whole integrated set of puzzles that are online.

The challenge here is to create specific chemical compounds by rearranging the atomic structure of the given compound(s) and delivering them to the destination through a pipes. You accomplish this using a series of reactors which can add, remove or re-arrange the atoms of a compound: each of these is a puzzle in and of itself. Deciding how many and which type of reactor to use in each level provides a sort of macro puzzle. Many levels limit the type and\/or number or reactors available, providing variety in addition to aesthetic and compound differences. You can save and load reactor layouts, allowing you to use them in different levels.Each level is so brilliantly complex in that you are not only trying to construct the most efficient way to modify the compounds within each reactor, you must also consider the overall purpose of each reactor in sequence: given that most compounds require several different reactors to change them into the desired result. Additionally (yes, there is more: bear with me, it will be worth it!), each level must be completed within a certain time frame or 'cycles'. Transporting each compound from the start to the destination takes time, as does modifying them through each reactor. If not designed efficiently, you may end up with bottlenecks in your chain of reactors, leading to the overall level time being too slow. This is usually fixed through some minor tweaking and provides another level of strategic planning to the each levels.I found the muisic to be quite enjoyable and the astheic both functional and pleasing to look at.

A friend of mine said that if you have any spark of a programmer inside of you, you will love this game. I agree with him. The 'language' that the Spacechem reactors use may be somewhat limited, but that's what forms much of the challenge of the game.And I mean it when I say it's fiendish. The tutorials are more akin to guidelines, and they don't tell you some of the tricks you will probably end up needing, meaning that self-discovery plays a fairly large role. Fortunately enough, the solutions are open-ended - seeing your solution work provides much of the satisfaction of the game. That's why if you get stuck (and you will probably get stuck a fair amount), it's best to find hints, go back to earlier levels to try and find inspiration from them or simply take a break.Anyway.

The catch is, you have to do so by constructing a machine in advance, and then let it solve the problem for you.  Making such a machine is not easy, and it is rare that it will work as expected the first time.  The \"machine\" as I described it is composed of two tracks, with instructions along them.  A disc, which the game calls a WALDO, travels along each track, following the instructions as it comes across them.  The instructions include making an input molecule appear, making an output molecule disappear, grabbing\/dropping a molecule, and bonding two molecules together.There are many ways to beat each level.  Some are more efficient than others.  The great thing about this is that it encourages you to replay old levels to try to find the most optimized way of beating them.

The best part is; the solution is most likely unique.The game offers countless of ways to solve a puzzle and teaches the basic concepts behind programming while doing it. There is no right way to solve a puzzle, there are faster ways, simpler ways, more understandble ways and your way.

Entering a DRM key with extremely tiny letters into a text field with no arrow key support (you can't go back and change a letter if you get one wrong, you have to delete everything and start over) is not a good way to start a fun game. Eventually I got it working, and I soon wished I hadn't.In a nutshell, this game is too simple in the action department, and too complex in the how-to-play department. I'll admit, I enjoy a good action game, but if a puzzler is done right, I can waste plenty of hours on it. This game, however, was just too boring. I didn't care who the hero was, I didn't care why he needed to move circles (molecules) around, the game just did not motivate me to move past the first few levels.Basically, if you like dragging and dropping shapes onto other shapes, you'll like this game.

The game challenges the player to come up with the most elegant solution (using the least amount of resources). Being an IT engineer, when I first watched the tutorial video, admittedly I thought in my head \"oh great, this is going to be like my job\" and while the gameplay does remind me a little bit like writing code, it was actually surprisingly fun. The game's overall presentation is nice, somewhat simple but it's tastefully done. The music is good, although at times it made feel like I'm watching a movie from the 90s. The pacing of the game is well done; the player is sanely and graciously introduced to game elements. The game's design allows for any number of solutions and after solving a problem the player is presented with a bell curve as to how they compared to \"other engineers\" (ie players). I really appreciated this aspect as it let me know that a more efficent and elegant solution is possible. My only complaint with the game is that it actually did feel a bit like my job (but in a good way). The feeling of satisfation I got from completing a puzzle was similiar to the satisfaction I get when writing a piece of code I'm proud of at work. It's a good feeling but by the end of the day I'm usually more keen on relaxation instead of solving complex problems.Overall this game is nicely designed and definitely worth consideration. This game engages the mind and respects the player with interesting and challenging puzzles.

In short, if you're looking for a puzzle - this is the game to get. It's fun from the start and only gets better.Do not buy this game if you can't program. Turing completeness makes for some of the most engaging puzzling we will probably ever see in a video game, but it also unfortunately means that I cannot in good faith recommend this title without that massive caveat. The game makes no pretenses about its true nature and the introductory challenges are little more than cues to familiarize yourself with the game's controls and the puzzle mechanics. The experience with the demo version is only a portion of what the game has to offer: a lack of confidence in tackling the game's challenges will frustrate you and copying other people's solutions will leave you with no understanding or appreciation of the game.","This is the kind of puzzler that lasts a while, and I haven't even really delved into the research.net stuff.  Half the fun is figuring out how to solve the puzzle.The other half is trying to figure out how to optimize it for symbols or length of time.I also love that I can see where I stand compared to others.  However, the numerical view is a bit confusing.  I can't tell if the number with the ) is my place or not.  I'll see something like 1) 486 on a puzzle, but if I look in graph view, I clearly am not the #1 solution.Still, I would highly recommend this game if you like puzzlers and don't mind challenging ones.","This is a great puzzle game.

So the babysitter just got to sit around and make sure everything was okay with the children. Later that night, the babysitter got bored and went to watch TV, but she couldn't watch it downstairs because they did not have cable downstairs (the parents didn't want children watching too much garbage). So, she called them and asked them if she could watch cable in the parent's room. Of course, the parents said it was OK, but the babysitter had one final request she asked if she could cover up the angel statue outside the bedroom window with a blanket or cloth, at the very least close the blinds, because it made her nervous. The phone line was silent for a moment, and the father who was talking to the babysitter at the time said, \"..Take the children and get out of the housewe will call the police.

The game starts simply, but the difficulty increases quickly. Pretty soon, you will find a puzzle that completely stumps you.This game is not for the feint of heart, the puzzles are hard. But since the game operates within a well defined set of rules, you will find yourself thinking of solutions throughout the day. I found myself drawing sketches to solutions that I had brainstormed while at work. Then I'd eagerly wait until the day was over to get home, try out the idea, and refine any issues.

In the course of the game you use reactors to combine elements into molecules - that's pretty much the gist of it.

From an actual chemistry standpoint it doesn't make a hell of a lot of sense, but what's really intriguing is that this takes the essence of programming\/circuit design and distills it into a fascinating game.

The programming aspect makes this into a \"sandbox\" pussle; you must fulfill the objectives, but there are an infinite amount of ways to do so. Afterwards you get a comparison with others that have played the level, and get to se how well you did versus them. The interesting part of that comparison is that it rates you on both processsing time and design simplicity, and in general you cannot do well in both.

Labeled fake chemistry, you're tasked with assembling various molecules from their base elements including the number of bonds required to make the molecule.  The puzzlyness (new word!) is excellent.  Receiving two inputs on a reactor, you have you output your end goal.  Eventually, molecules are so complex that you'll need multiple sub combines in different reactors pumped into the other reactors in order to combine the final element.  There's 2 scales of assemble, one where goods are piped into and out of the reactors that to the combinations and then the actual assembly puzzles within the reactors themselves.  When you hit the go switch, the elements are pumped in at a fixed rate and everything must be processed and timed in order to get the right targets out the other end.Hard to explain, fantastic to play.  Easily in my top five of puzzle games of all time.  Hard to find something bad to say about this game apart from it not having much replayability apart from making your designs more efficient.

I've spent countless hours and the music got to me a bit.2) Non-gameplay graphics (like the pyramid) are a bit low-res and blurry when viewed on a large monitor.3) I encountered a bug: sometimes when I opened some old completed level, the plant schemes were slightly messed up (any any change breaks everything for good).

It's open ended puzzles allow for nifty solutions while the limited space to work with creates very difficult, but very rewarding puzzles. I have spent more than 80 hours playing SpaceChem plus many more hours before I got it on steam.The only downside with the game is that it can be very difficult for newcommers to work out how the game works.","If you enjoy coding, math, or any kind of hard science, this game will consume your life. I spent WEEKS playing it when it came out, usually with a tab of graph paper and a pen. It presents you with challenge after challenge, and you'll have to be as efficient and creative as possible to complete them.If i could pick one game that i think would be a great thing to be literally addicted to; it's this one. It's almost an educational game (though not really about chemistry) in disguise, in that it forces you to think like an engineer.","Spacechem shouldn't be fun. But it is. It starts off relatively gently, easing you in to the different processes. But soon your head is close to exploding as you try to refine your factory designs just that little bit more, or try to avoid your pipes backing up and everything breaking. It is pure logic, and so you should know whether or not this is for you. If in doubt, give it a try - there is a ton of depth that belies the simple looking screenshots","A lesser-known jem of a game, and one of the hardest (and unique) puzzle games I have ever known.

Interestingly enough, a background in computer science will go a long way to helping you get past the tough levels.","Very challenging puzzle game, keeps you thinking.","Possibly one of the most difficult puzzle games available.  This is sort of a robotic manufacturing game, where raw materials are disassembled, re-arranged and re-assembled using a handful of simple graphical commands on tracks.  This is the only game I'm aware of which has race conditions, just like what you find in real-life programming.I recommend it - go ahead and play the demo.  Even if it isn't your cup of tea, I tend to think you can overcome any feeling of \"this game makes me feel dumb\" if you approach it as an exploration: \"what happens if we try this?\"  It takes a lot of persistence, knowing that every puzzle does have a solution.  But the payoff - especially for such a small price - is HUGE.  You'll learn to think in a more organized fashion by playing, I'm convinced of it.","Challenging puzzler, requires thinking in specific ways.SpaceChem starts you off very simple to ease you in to the basic way of things, but then quickly ramps things up. That learning curve may leave a lot of folks out in the cold, as I've found you need to learn specific techniques to complete the middle to later levels, and if you don't happen to think them up (or perhaps look them up) you might be left frustrated.If you enjoy puzzlers and difficulty I heartily recommend SpaceChem. Do come at it knowing that you may get stuck, but once you figure things out (or get a little help, perhaps) the satisfaction of beating a tough puzzle is well worth it.","Makes you think a lot in optimizing the layout of your production facility. Overall very enjoyable.","Are you a programmer, chemical engineer, or autistic?

Building requires dragging and dropping visual components, a kind of \"visual programming\".  It's a little like \"The Incredible Machine\" in that regard; without the Rube-Goldberg-esque humour, but far more deep and challenging.Any successful design will get you past a level, but if you're like me you'll continually revisit your solutions and try to improve them, by using fewer components, or making more efficient solutions.","This game is actualy one of the best logical puzzles that I ever played.It's challenging, but rewarding, it is based on real life chemistry, and it combines it with interesting puzzles. I honestly think, that games like Space Chem can be used in schools to make education more fun and attractive to people.I strongly recommend to give it a try if you want to challenge your brain.","Great indie puzzle game, and without much parallel from what I've seen.There were great puzzles in the actual game, and much more in the researchnet when you've finished the game. There isn't much actual chemistry in the game; it's used more as a basis for the puzzles. The storyline was good, the visuals were fine. The reason why this game stands out is the open-endedness of the puzzles; finding your own solution and improving upon it is the main thrill of this game, and the euphoria of completing a puzzle or optimizing your design to the most efficient possible is where this game gets its fun. There bell curves (usually) in the missions, which tell you how well your solution is compared to others.I've been told that this game is quite similar to programming, which may drive you away or towards this game. I find it more about making a machine and watching it work as it executes commands the way you programmed it.On the other side, I'd say that the graphics in the reactors themselves are rather bland, but I can excuse that as it would become too complex if it weren't bland. I'd prefer if the game had told me what you can do and what you can't do with the molecules (can't collide), and there are some hidden tricks which are not mentioned at all (bonder priority, especially, though particle smashing to a lesser extent as well). The music also may get a bit repetitive (I personally can't get tired of it though).Other than that, this game is quite an amazing puzzle game. I'd recommend it for anyone looking for an intellectual challenge.","Mind bending!","Spacechem is a very demanding game.  It asks you, the player, to be creative and logical, to come up with your own answers for seemingly-intractable problems.  How well you receive the game will depend on how much you enjoy this type of challenge.If you get stuck on the main storyline, your only real recourses are to 1. keep hammering at it, 2. search out a video of how someone else did it for inspiration, or 3. take a break and try some of the side-missions.  These are available in the 'research net' section, and are user-created challenges released periodically.  They can also be undertaken in any order you wish.The only strikes against the game are:  Some features are not fully explained in terms of how they interact, so you have to do a bit of experimentation.  The working space and other limitations can be a real bear in some levels (i.e.. if you just had a bit more room to breathe, it would be a lot less frustrating).  They will frequently introduce some cool new feature in one mission series, show you how to use it, test you on it, then abandon it going forward.  You'll come to a level and think \"ok, I just have to set this up with some switches\/sensors\/whatever, and I'll be good to..  they took those out?!  WTF!\"The defense levels are a little forced, and don't work all that well, in my opinion.As far as procedural puzzlers go, it's top notch.","Brilliant puzzle game. Gets you thinking, and (may) help you learn (a little) about chemistry.And fishcakes.","Definitely recommended with a couple caveats:- Some puzzles will take hours\/days to solve. You will be thinking about these puzzles during your spare time. You may even start keeping\/carrying around a notepad to sketch possible solutions on. - You WILL get very frustrated. However, my advice is to NOT look up the answers, because again, the satisfaction you'll get from solving a level you've worked at for days is worth it. This game has caused more frustration than any game I can remember since the NES era. It's THAT hard. The difficulty spikes something fierce after only a couple levels. However, I can say that very few, if any, games have caused me to feel so satisfied from solving one of the levels.

You can find tips online however to help.That said once you get the hang of things you can literally spend hours, if not days, working on a single puzzle.

Puzzle game that is Challenging and requires much thought and Diligence No 1 specific way to win the levels (which is awesome for a puzzle game)A little tiring after playing it a lot, but a great game to go back to after a few years. :)"],["The most satisfying puzzle game I have ever played. I found the mechanics kinda difficult to grasp at the beginning but the basic principles are fairly easy to understand. Basically, you are building molecules out of atoms (who would have guessed). You start the game with one reactor that has 2 \"circuits\" in it, you can modify shape of these circuits and put different commands on them that will input\/output atoms, grab them, bond them together, you can also rotate the molecules and do other stuff with them that I don't know about yet since I am not too far into the game.Later on, you will be given multiple reactors that can all be \"programmed\" separately giving the game a whole new level. For instance, you can have one reactor that will be used to brake bonds between atoms, then it will output them to another reactor that will bond them together with different atoms to form the molecule that you need. Now all of this sounds like you need a degree in chemistry and physics to be able to play the game but that is absolutely not the case. It's all logical, you don't need to know absolutely anything about chemistry or any other science.What some people may dislike about this game is that it ramps up the difficulty fairly quickly but a nice thing is that all the solutions are always saved and you can revisit previous levels to go over the basics again, experiment or improve your designs. Because unlike many other puzzle games where you are merely trying to find the single solution that the developers invented, in Spacechem there are hundreds if not thousands of solutions to every level and there is even online workshop kind of thing where you can download player-created levels and also upload your own (I hope that's what it's for, I have never actually used it :D), giving the game a HUGE replay value. I can imagine sinking hundreds upon hundreds of hours into this.Even though I am not very good at puzzle games and I doubt I will ever finnish this one because the difficulty gets absolutely ridiculous in later levels from what I've seen on youtube, I have to recommend Spacechem. It's extremely original, challenging, satisfying and fun. What more could you possibly ask of a puzzler? It even has a story!

There are challenges associated with many of the puzzles. You do not have to complete them to beat the game, but they really make you think and work for the achievement. They can be tough, but I enjoyed solving them. Nothing in the game is forced on you with the challenges and achievements. It saves your progress so you can keep moving forward in the game and go back later to beat the challenges. I really felt a sense of accomplishment finishing this game. Many puzzle games become the a+b =c formula and thus, boring. Space Chem held to the end.The controls and UI worked really well. Learning the hotkeys helps. There are many videos on You Tube. Really cool after you beat a puzzle, you can see how others did it. I did not see any of my solutions online and there are may ways to solve each one. The instruction on new tools were good.

It's an extremely simple approach to puzzle design, but that's where SpaceChem shines. Because every level can generally be described as a brief list of inputs and outputs, puzzles will stick in your mind for long after you step away from the computer, and you can spend a lot of time thinking about solutions wherever you are.Spacechem's greatest, strength, though, is it's difficulty curve. The game does a superb job of introducing an enormous amount of unique mechanics at a rate that makes them feel exciting instead of overwhelming. You always feel like you're playing with a larger set of tools than you had previously, and it rarely feels like too much to handle. That said, the game is far from easy.

Via problem-solving, you figure out how to tell the computer to do what you want it to do. Once your program is finished, you run it, and find out it doesn't work.

You've been warned!.The game starts with easy to understand tutorials and easy puzzles and then, difficulty increases puzzle after puzzle up to the hell.The overall goal for each puzzle is to get some atoms or molecules and transform them, to send the results to some storage  later.To transform particles, you use reactors. Each reactor can have up to two input and two ouput spots. You chain reactors and storages through pipes. You can chain reactors to produce the final product with the help of intermediate products.Reactors have some kind of program, with some special instructions: wait for input, grab, drop, rotate, bind, unbind, sync, branch if certain atom is being detected, flush the output area, etc. You will have to \"program\" a sequence of instructions to solve the puzzle and, just with the instructions and tools available for each puzzle.Graphics are good and attractive enough for this particular kind of game. The User's Interface is clear, easy to learn and, easy to use, very straight forward. You can do everything with just the mouse or, you can use keyboard shortcuts if you like it.The game was very well programmed, has no glitches, works smoothly and, seems to be very well optimized.This game is one on its kind. The idea is very original and, even that game mechanics sound so easy that can end boring you, the real thing is that puzzles are so challenging that you don't have such a feeling.But, be aware, if you don't like games that challenge your mind, don't buy this one; after a few of short easy puzzles you will face really challenging ones.I could say this is a casual game but, believe it, once you start a challenging puzzle, you will loose hours or days trying to figure out a solution. It's highly addictive.You can learn from solutions already designed by other people, by watching some youtube video (and, yes, you will do that), To beat the rest of community of players, you should solve the puzzles by using the less ammount of cycles (production cycles), the less amount of resources (reactors, storages, etc.) and the less amount of symbols (programming instructions).

The \"chemistry\" thing is a clever aesthetic conceit to make it so the simple objects you're assembling seem to have some real world grounding and help motivate you to solve the problems.  A cool thing about it is how open-ended it is for a puzzle game; as you run your assembly line, you get a count on how long it takes to output the quota of chemicals.  I've spent a lot of time going back to solutions that were good enough to pass, just to find ways to make them more efficient.  Sometimes this means making minor adjustments to reduce the pauses necessary to avoid collisions, sometimes it means changing the whole assembly line.  There's a lot of replayability here.One issue with that replayability is that there isn't an obvious way to back up your previous solutions (within the game that is), which made me reluctant to wipe the slate clean on my nicer solutions.

At the end of every level, you're given a graph showing the best and worst scores for the puzzle, and you can hit tab to see how you compare to your friends, and eventually see where your friends gave up. The rankings gauge you in three areas - how fast your solution performs, how many reactors your solution uses (efficiency part 1) and how many commands your solution uses (efficiency part 2).

(EDIT: It seems to not be saving my progress. Dammit. Oh well, I guess I get to have more practice, then.)I've played a lot of programming puzzle games before. As a general rule, if you're teaching an aspect of computer science, it usually turns out fairly good, and if you're just teaching people how to bash directions into a small space, it usually sucks.And then you've got stuff like SpaceChem, RoboZZle, and Jahooma's LogicBox, which are a bit of both. And they turn out amazing.(There are other categories, although Hack 'n' Slash gets its own special category for pretending to teach you how to hack but you have to go through some cumbersome chores first and you get bored before you finish them. Avoid.)SpaceChem, from a computer science perspective, is a game about multithreading, and avoiding race conditions. Or something like that.From a non-compsci perspective, it's about moving atoms around, binding them together, and hoping you get the right results and also hoping they don't smash into each other.Either way, it's a puzzle game that holds your hand for a few tutorial levels and basically gives you the \"standard\" answer, and then leaves you to it. It has a rather sharp difficulty curve, but even if you're stumped on a later level, you can always go back to an earlier one and look at just how bad the \"standard\" solution you were given on a silver platter was, and improve on it.You can also compute compete against your friends to see who can solve a puzzle in the fewest number of cycles, or use the fewest number of symbols... or the fewest number of reactors for some of the later puzzles that are still early enough to be in the demo version.Did I mention there's a demo version? You should play it, and then if you like it (and I will make you like it) then you can throw your money at Zachtronics and get the full version.In short, SpaceChem is a really good programming puzzle game that teaches you the fun of dealing with race conditions, and there's more than one way to do each puzzle.","nie graem ale kupiem na promocji za 0,99 euro za itemki xd ale i tak polecam","This game will steal your life.

Yes! Yes! A thousand times yes!","This game has little to do with chemistry. It's an automata programming game.I remembered the first time I see such a game when I was in high school. It's called  Manutactoria . You are literally programming Turing Machines there. And I think SpaceChem is quite similar: the semantics of and the interactions between the elements are simple, but with these simple elements, you can do infinitely complex jobs.It's hard, but not all that hard. I completed all the puzzles in the story line except for the optional ones and the final boss fight in a little more than 20 hours. You do need to focus on the most specific things like the placement of the bounders and routing the two waldos through the array of symbols, and some times these problems are solved with ugly ad-hoc tricks, but you definitely should go beyond that level. Once you discovered how to do a recurring task like moving around a cross-shaped array of bounders to assemble or disassemble a methane molecule or arranging several flip-flops to perform a sequence of commands a desired amount of times, the puzzles starts to get easier. You quickly figure out similar structures in the input and output and decide what should go where. Then you adjust your known structures to solve each step and the job is done.Every time when you see in the statistics that your dashed yellow line is way to the left of the peak of the bar chart, you feel clever.Those at the right end of the chart are not stupid either. Everyone who progressed to the later part of the game must be clever.But some people are just more clever than others. The research net is the difficult part. It is organized into volumes and issues, just like real scientific journals. Amusing. But the puzzles there are seriously difficult. Most of the time you stare at the puzzles and think, \"How is that even possible? The author must be insane!\"When you finally solved a difficult problem and see your efficient and elegant (or not so mush so) production pipeline running, see those materials flowing in and products flowing out after some arcane transformation, you start getting fascinated, even though you are the one who built those things. Sometimes I am amazed at how good us humans are at discovering patterns and constructing increasingly complex structures from simpler ones. Maybe that is central to our intelligence.","The incredible depth and learning curve held up until the last few levels got a bit sketchy, your answers to the problems can be honed and optimised for endless replayabilty.

Just be aware, that the developer will likely drop support at the first sign of trouble.Edit: there is a public fix at https:\/\/github.com\/leafi\/fix-spacechem-os-x, which works flawlessly for me. I will change the review to positive as soon as this fix is integrated in the application.","TL;DR:It's not a bad game, but you should think carefully about whether or not you are the target audience.On paper, SpaceChem sounds exactly like my kind of game. It's a playful take on concurrent programming, and on top of that, it's themed around chemistry.I like puzzle games. I like programming. I like chemistry. Surely I will like SpaceChem then, right?Unfortunately not. I tried really hard to enjoy this game, but each time I play, a very distinctly nagging feeling hit me: I could just be programming. The game isn't bad in any notable way, and I actually had some fun playing it. But I just have so much more fun actually programming.This will be a \"buyers beware\" to the kind of people that get irritable during handhold-y tutorials and on-rails games.SpaceChem is a game. Not a sandbox. This game boils programming down to two concepts: Solving the problem, and optimizing your solution. There is going to be one single \"best\" solution to the problem at hand, and your solution is going to be either optimal or sub-optimal. End of story.Here is why you will probably like this game:If you need someone to tell you what your immediate goal is, if you feel uncomfortable with just being dropped in the deep end with no milestones or objectives, this game is for you! Intimidating as it may seem, this game does a wonderful job at providing the player with a controlled environment, clear goals, instructions and rules.Here is when and why you should think twice about buying this game:This game does its own thing, and it does it well, but it is neither chemistry nor computer science in any way. It is a game with a theme. At most, it is about repeatedly improving on solutions to the same problem. Hence, neither \"because programming\" nor \"because chemistry\" should be your reason for purchasing this title.If you have a fascination with chemistry, have done any programming in the past, or just generally prefer sandbox games, this is not that.","It straddles the line between challenging and frustrating, depending on what day it is. It's one of those games where you actually have to work for the achievements, and it's great value for money (I've got around 80 hrs for the actual time I spent with it and I think I'm about halfway there).

Nevertheless the concept is great and as it gets gradually more difficult and there are often new things to discover it can keep you busy for quite a long time.","If you enjoy programming, this game is a wonderful way to sink hours (or days) of thinking into something. It's easy enough at first that you can learn the mechanics, and feel confident enough that when you reach the much more challenging levels, you'll try for days to beat them. I'd even spend time in my classes drawing out solutions to levels that came into my head. It's definitely worth your time and money, but only if you're interested in programming (and possibly space\/chemistry).","Great","Challenging until it got so hard that it felt like work.","What can I say about SpaceChem? I thoroughly enjoyed it, in the way that one enjoys the Sunday Crossword in the NYT, or figuring out how to solve a six-layer Rubix Cube. The game does a good job introducing you to the basic mechanics, but strategy is all up to you. Some experimentation is required to figure out the finer details of how different features work.The first few levels are a walk in the park and the story is actually quite entertaining. Once I got a ways into it, the levels started taking me so long (because by jove they were complex!) that by the time I got another peice of storyline I'd forgotten the last thing that happened.Probably not for everyone - it's a *very* difficult puzzler, but for me this game was two thumbs up.","This game has a really strange difficulty curve, it's almost a difficulty wall, and there is basically no hand-holding.

In levels that require reactors, you have to plan ahead on what reactor will do what if you don't want to have 1h of work go to garbage because you need 1 more reactor to complete the mission and you've already reached the limit.Once you pass a level of difficulty, this game just keeps delivering harder and harder content.

I bought it on a whim and I have not been disappointed.What you have here is a casually serious game. How's that work? No time limits except for a rare occasion; You can easily stop, reset everything, and try again without repercussion. Make a mistake? Oops! No need for save scumming. Just hit the stop button and try again.(Dusts off highschool chemistry book)... Okay there we go. You may not need this (knocks on book) or be in an episode of Breaking Bad, but understanding how chemistry works is important. You simply cant put an atom here or there, willy-nilly and expect the same product.Timing, Loops, Logic, and Forethought. Being bred into a musical family, the first three I am very capable of. The forethought? Not so much. You have to look at paths, instructions, and syncronization. If you let some parts go without some sort of \"wait for blue\/red path to reset\", you can bork the whole thing in a bink of an eye.While this game gets progressively more difficult, it doesnt leave you hanging. Sure there's going to be some face-planting on the desk, but when you realize that the instruction symbols have other options it changes the game. When your puzzle fails, it will show you where you failed. You just have to figure out why. You dont always have to use BOTH red and blue.The soundtrack music may turn many of you off, but I found it inspirational and motivating. There are not many songs, but they have that \"movie\" feel. Hard to tell its all synthesized.","What to say? As far as puzzling games go, this is very, very, very top of the league. What starts out as nearly trivially simple with the first level or two quickly becomes a mind-bender which keeps on busy for ours. The whole is packaged with minimalistic graphics which suite the games just perfect. Any more eye-candy would have been a distraction. The puzzel interface is also well made, with shortcut keys allowing for quick restructuring. What remains is the 'storyline' which  is surely rather minimalistic but still motivating to 'move on' to the next level and see what happens. If you like training your brain with novel ideas, this game is a must-have. Just don't be too hard on yourself if you get stuck over a puzzle for a long time  - finally cracking it is so rewarding! And if you want to get \"full value\" for your money, try beating other people by finding a yet-more-efficient solution.   In short: This game was simply my best purchase over the last year.

Additionally, since it is possible to design your own puzzles, I can easily understand the existence of online contests around this game.Unfortunately, I think that it is my programming background that shows the flaws in the developement environment. The help screens (and tooltips) are a bit lacking in detail. The cut-n-paste mechanics are a bit too weak. The ability to save components for reuse are also not useful enough.

You're free to create whatever solution you can think of to solve each puzzle... within the confines of a rather restricted space. And it may not look too restricted at first but in the later worlds, whoo, does space management become a big aspect. I understand the need for it though, having no space restraint would make a lot of puzzles really simple in comparison to what they are now, though.The difficulty curve of the game is pretty dang smooth, ranging from simple in world 1 to \"literally hours for every single puzzle\" in worlds 6 through 9. But no challenge ever feels insurmountable when you face it, just intimidating. It's very clearly a programming-styled puzzle game, and it hits all the right nerves with that; designing the best functions to keep the overall design running smoothly, optimizing ever so slightly to hit a time quota, finding new and more efficient ways to solve a problem that subsequently frees up reactor space you desperately needed. I'm one to dive right in to the puzzles and keep tweaking away at them until I hit upon something that functions the way I need to, and then stubbornly stick to whatever functions unless I can't possibly work around it, and, generally, the game doesn't stop me from using this philosophy successfully. There's probably something to be said for planning out something elegant in advance, too, and I bet there are some really cool puzzle designs made that way. It's a game that feels very free, even in its restrictiveness.The game's visuals are basic but effective, they get the job done. The music is... I honestly have no clue, there's too little of it for how long the game runs on and I had to turn it off and put on my own music after a while. The story is passable, but with how long I went between each time I played this game I found it hard to keep track of.That is one thing... this game is incredibly exhausting to play. I'll hammer away at the solution for one puzzle for a few hours and then when I've solved it I'm completely drained and end up not coming back to the game for weeks or even months.

The way SpaceChem wraps it into a Lovecraftian space adventure provides an interesting story, if sometimes a bit predictable. But nevertheless, it is a game that has replay value, because there is no fixed way of solving the problem presented. There are fast ways, there are efficient ways, there are fast efficient ways, and then you can do it as complicated as you like - SpaceChem provides a variety of solutions even for the simpler puzzles.And when I say simpler, I mean puzzles involving a molecule consisting of two, maybe three kinds of atoms, and the product requiring the same atoms in different configuration.

Space in the reactor is limited and you have to make sure, that the atoms won't collide with reactor walls or other atoms.If there's one aspect of programming, that SpaceChem got really well, it's the fact that there are many solutions to one problem.

Nothing beats the euphoria you'll get from finally beating a puzzle you've been stuck on.Overall, SpaceChem is worth the full asking price as an excellent design-oriented puzzle game.

If you're playing on a Mac, you'll need to download an additional tool to fix your installation. (Why the developer can't distribute that fix through Steam remains unclear.)If you've ever written multithreaded code (and enjoyed it), you'll love this game. One of the most important instructions is \"sync,\" which works just like a cyclic barrier. Both waldos must reach a \"sync\" instruction before either can continue past one.

The game can be likened to performing a chemical experiment in the sense that a puzzle can be visualized in the following way:                                       Reactants ---> Intermediate(s) ---> ProductsBut, of course, the processes are not realistic chemical reactions (or rather the intermediates are not realistic).","L'art de synthtiser de l'uranium avec  de l'hydrogne. 9\/10"],["Overall a great and original puzzle game. It's tagged \"programming\", and for good reason -- even though it doesn't appear to be a programming game on the surface, it will probably be much more natural to people with a programming background.That said, I have found it much more enjoyable than TIS-100, which it is quite similar to in terms of the puzzle construction.

Some of the early puzzles are quite challenging while some of the later ones are sometimes a bit to easy.","Every new level has me cursing in surprise at the steep challange curve. Example.\"What the ?\"\"Aww  me.\"\"How in the  ?\"\"Ok this one's easy...wait.......\"It's the dark souls of puzzle games."],["What a wonderful game. It uses very simple concepts, but requires you to combine them in ever-more sophisticated ways.Well polished, well implemented. Difficulty ramps up nicely, and the UI does its best to stay out of your way (with the notable exception of output labels which need to be hidden manually via a checkbox)It's worth noting that progressing is not just about additional complexity (althought that's present too). It's about finding an elegant optimisation that will help you out of a tight corner.If you love creative, complex problem solving, I think you'll enjoy this game.","The learning curve is so steep it's vertical.  That being said it is an excellent concept and a challenge I recommend.  You think it's tough, and the game just keeps adding elements (of the functional variety as well as the chemical variety).","Highly addictive and difficult puzzle game.Could use a window scaling mode.","This game is incredibly difficult. The learning curve is steeper than perhaps any game I've ever seen, and you're expected to pay close attention whenever the game teaches you something new. Oftentimes just looking up the solution for a puzzle online won't be enough to help because it requires a thorough understanding of how things work in order to progress. However, once you get the hang of the mechanics and are into the rhythm of the puzzles, it is one of the most rewarding puzzle games I have ever played. The complexity of the game means that there are millions of creative solutions for a single puzzle, and I've even gone back to previous puzzles to improve on an old design after learning a new trick or two. The room for improvement is almost infinite; I could see playing for hundreds of hours and still getting better.So if you're a puzzle aficionado willing to get past the first two hours of struggling to understand what the hell is going on, it's easy to lose yourself in this game for hours at a time. An instant favorite in my puzzle game collection!","There are quite a lot of pipeline\/conveyor games out there. SpaceChem is one of the coolest of those.

Godspeed, engineers."],["original, amazing","it's okay","SpaceChem is basically its own genre of puzzle game. Each level requires you to program the \"waldos\" (the red and blue circles) to move input molecules around a screen and create different molecules as output. As you progress in the game, more commands are introduced which allow you to use the waldos in more interesting or more efficient ways. I played this game for 92 hours, more than any other game in my account, to beat every level and obtain the 20 achievements. It has remained challenging and engaging throughout, and I have never played a game quite like it.What really distinguishes SpaceChem from puzzle games in general is that it is open-ended. It feels like you are inventing a solution, not finding it. For any given puzzle you will find people who have implemented a solution and optimized it in dozens of conceptually different ways. Speaking of optimization, it's important to mention that the creators made optimization totally optional. Yet, I have found that some of my most satisfying moments playing the game were getting some highly optimized solution to work (e.g. with just one reactor, or with a tiny number of symbols) after hours of effort.As far as programming games go, a major strength of the game (over, for instance, TIS-100) is how visually intuitive it is. Everything is executed by the waldos moving around the screen; nothing is hidden from you. Debugging your program is simply a matter of watching what happens when you click \"run\". You don't really have to read what the rules are, as you just learn them by experimenting.I do have some negative things to say. I am not alone in complaining that the boss fights are not as enjoyable; especially the very last level, which was made difficult in a number of annoyingly artifical ways and ultimately made me take a few months away from the game. Having beat it, I appreciate it a bit more, but the limited space for the reactors was just unnecessary. In general, I think that I enjoy small, elegant puzzles a lot more (which I can then go and optimize), rather than these 5- or 6-reactor messy puzzles where the solution is to put a whole bunh of easy pieces together into a working contraption, and debug it."],["I really enjoy games like this where you have to mechanically program cycles of operations to reach the desired output. I also played Infinifactory which is similar to this. It has a good balance of giving you some freedom to come up with different solutions, but not getting too complex like a full programming language. The achievements are also well balanced where they make you think and plan out a solution, but definitely doable.There are lots of levels and an interesting text-based story line. The boss fight levels where you're under attack are fun too.10\/10 would get slapped by giant tentacles again.","I don't trust any space agency. They are all lying. No one has ever been to space. It's that simple. Not saying space isnt real, but I know stars, the sun, and moon are not what they are taught to be. Further more, once you learn that no curvature can be detected on Earth from any experiment, and you learn Earth is flat, you really start to get a good perspective on how just about everything that is taught is complete hogwash, along with history.Check out this book in link below. Curvature cannot be detected. No matter how hard you look. It doesn't take much common sense to put two and two together. The problem is, no one wants to actually do the research. They just see the words 'flat earth' and turn livid; because, we've been brainwashed by this lie since we could speak. It's normal to reject it at first, but if you do not research it for yourself, then you're just cheating yourself. Modern science is a religion and it takes faith to believe in all these theories that are needed in order to support more theories. Did you know gravity is still just a theory that needs the theory of relativity to be true for it to be possible? Just look it up.The book is called, \"Earth Not A Globe\". Check link below for free download. Also, look up \"Convex Earth The Documentary\". We've been lied to. Once you can accept that, then you can see the world with new eyes, and everything begins to make more sense.

The basic rules and mechanics are very easy to pick up and understamd, but can be used in very sophisticated ways in order to make optimal solutions for the puzzles.The core game on it's own contains a large number of levels that are broken down into 3 major types:* Research Assignments (the 'simplest' type, which all takes place in a single chemical reactor).* Production Assignments (In which the problem is hard enough to require multiple reactors).* Defence Assigntments (Which basically play much in the same way as Production Assignments, with the added caviat that you have time pressure in the form of some eldrich horror trying to destroy the facility).It has a neat little story about your career at SpaceChem whose chapers unlock as you progress through the game.

They stuck me in, and usually don't let me go until I solved them.

I logged out 6 hours later.This puzzle is the rare kind that have a relatable backstory. You don't have to read it to advance in the game, and it's not forced down your throat. It's nice and relatable, especially for people who worked at a high tech firm before.The tutorials could be a bit more interactive, or at least animated. Some controls are well hidden, and never explained throughout the game. The graphics are OK, it's not beautiful. Well, it is, if you are into retro gaming, but given it's 2017 and you are playing as an employee of a space age high tech firm, it's pretty low. However, you spend most of your time on the reactor screen, which is pretty good.Controls are OKish. You can't customise the keys, though, so unless you like to play dragging and dropping, prepare for the standard WASD keys (and you still need your mouse). Oh, you are using Dvorak or Colemak, or another esoteric layout? Then you should stick to your mouse.The puzzles, however, are really nice. You occasionally get an easy one, that can be solved in minutes. But then you get an insane one you spend hours to figure out, without finding a solution.

Not easy and I hate when games are easy, where's the fun in that?","Tedious is the only word that can describe it. I dropped after multiple reactor stages started, as  testing\/debuging your solution requires waiting for input (from previous reactor) to be produced and arrive. It should have topology in tags instead of programming as it more about solving geometric constraints instead of creating code."],["Less daunting than it seems and very fun if you like logic puzzles. The game subtly pushes you towards making elegant solutions by having leaderboards that show your friends' metrics (how many cycles\/steps their solution took, how many reactors they used, how many logic symbols it took), which adds another layer to the challenge. It's the kind of game where I'll be stumped by a problem and will walk away, think about it over the course of the day, and then come back and try out some of the solutions that I'd thought about. A lot of trying and failing and refining until you come up with something that works. In a sense it's a primer for Zachtronics' later programming and engineering games, as it was where they first developed the underlying programming-esque gameplay that drives them.

For example, basics of parallel processing are taught in some form or another youll encounter race conditions, synchronization issues, waiting\/locking, etc These lessons are introduced gradually and organically; first by the use of the two waldos on a single job, and later emphasized in levels which you handle multiple reactors.More generally, the game also does a great job of teaching about design compromises.  Its almost always impossible to minimize symbol usage, reactor usage, and speed, so youll have to choose which to optimize for.The only downside is that it can feel like work.  Granted, its a magic version of work thats always leading towards rewarding, lightbulb-over-the-head moments.

And your solutions are your own, potentially unique to anyone else's, which will solve the problem ... for additional challenges you can go back and optimize (cycle counts are monitored as well as 'symbol' use - where cycles are essentially how long your solution takes, and symbols' are the number of instructions required to carry out your solution in the graphical 'programming' interface).

Steps 2 and 3 are not fun...Because puzzles in Spacechem have a large number of workable solutions, you never hit that brick wall of what does the developer want me to do here?.Spacechem is less about eureka moments and more about breaking down each problem into smaller problems, then whittling away at those using cold hard logic.

I haven't even come close to beating it) introduces enough interesting mechanics to build on what the player has already learned which keep the game interesting. Not only that, but most puzzle games have one solution, which the player has to find. I'm not bashing this as an idea, some of my favourite games work this way, but SpaceChem feels special in that it pretty much gives the player a blank canvas with a goal, and leaves the player with their knowledge of the game and the elements they're given to get to that solution however they want. It has a level of creativity that most other puzzle games simply don't have, and I loved every second of it. As such, beating a level feels particularly satisfying as I beat it using MY solution, rather than just \"oh. that's what I was supposed to do. I guess that makes sense\". It's not even an illusion of creativity as several times I've been introduced to a new mechanic, not understood it (most of the stuff in this game takes time to wrap your head around) and just beat the level without even using the new mechanic, just using my previous knowledge.

The story is given as text for the player to read in their spare time which is one of the worst ways to tell a story in games imo. I don't know if it's any good because I never bothered to read it, but I'm not gonna be harsh about it since when I bought SpaceChem I wasn't exactly thinking \"Oh boy, this should be an interesting story\".

It can be quite tricky to find room for the instructions you need without causing your \"molecules\" to collide with one another or with the edges of the play area, which gets extremely frustrating up until you manage to squeeze everything in, but that just makes coming up with a tight design super-satisfying.  If simply solving a problem isn't enough for you, you can try to optimize your solution for speed, symbol count, and reactor count.  I've heard the histograms haven't been updated in a long time, but that doesn't make it any less satisfying to find your score to the left of a big bump in the graph.The \"production\" problems additionally require you to choose how to subdivide the problem into pieces you can tackle with the available reactor types, but on the other hand they allow you to choose how to subdivide the problem into manageable pieces.  However, if you can't come up with a good approach, you can often find a reddit comment where someone gives a hint describing a set of reactors in terms of their inputs \/ outputs and (in tricky cases) interconnections, and there's still plenty of satisfaction to be found in actually programming the reactors.

It's an assembly-line style puzzler, without set solutions. What that means is that there's not one \"right\" answer to a puzzle, instead, it's an open-ended question.The graphics, mechanics, and sound are all really good, and if you like optimizing assembly lines, this is the game for you.Most puzzles hinge on you being given not nearly enough space to do something comfortably, and being forced to squeeze your assembly lines into places they really don't fit.The storyline is decent, not great, but where this game shines is the high you get from solving something that looked impossible. As for content, the game is pretty long itself, and the user-made levels are practically endless. (Though, as fair warning, a lot of the user levels had a difficulty curve that made the main game look like a tutorial. It was like hitting a brick wall of \"oh god how is that remotely possible\") All in all, this game is excellent, just really niche. If you're still unsure, look up \"Codex of Alchemical Engineering\" online, it's a free game made by the same people, with an almost identical feel. If you like that, buy this.

There was just so much logic to cram into two reactors, that I tried and tried but couldn't come up with the right approach. I watched some solutions on Youtube, but was fortunately to proud to just copy one. After putting the game aside for a few months, I tried it again and did it. The feeling of success was immense, even though the statistics that can be seen in a histogram after each level were bad.Wikipedia gives the perfect description of the game as \"visual programming language\". The most difficult restrictions, when designing the solutions are that only one command for each color can be on a field and that each field can be only run through from two sides (before flip flops are introduced). So later solutions sometimes blow up in size, because you run into unexpected problems and somehow still want it to run. But after all everything can be optimized and made better through hard thinking and that is, what makes this and other Zachtronics games so great.My main criticism is the lack of a storing option for several solutions at once. I would for example like to use aforementioned solution as a starting point for optimization, but at the same time try completely new approaches. It's not possible without using another profile where I would have to do the complete game again upon this point.

What happens infrequently, the name completely conveys the essence: we have to do chemistry in space (not in the open, of course, but not on Earth) as a young engineer, namely, to program processes in molecular reactors, and sometimes even build small production complexes .I think, already at this moment it becomes clear that SpaceChem is not an action, not a quest or even a graphic novel, SpaceChem is a very harsh and hardcore puzzle, but first things first. Let's start with the plot.He is, and meets us with the phrase \"You know, people die in space\", which sets the general tone for the whole story. The plot here is essentially a medium-sized short story that connects levels and reveals a classic parable about the menacing majesty of the unknown and the fragility of the person who encounters this unknown. Pretty pleasant reading, framed by small sketches. But the salt of the game is far from history. It's time to talk about the gameplay itself.Most of the time, the player watches a ten-by-eight board. On this board, he programs two lines - red and blue. When the reactor starts, manipulators start running along the lines, which, when passing through the cells marked by the player, perform various actions - they capture and throw, connect, rotate molecules of various substances (new teams appear later). The goal is to obtain molecules of other substances from the molecules of some substances that appear in the left half of the reactor through transfers and transformations, and then send them to the right half. And you need to program the reaction scheme so that it runs for several tens of cycles. It seems to me that it is rather difficult to describe game mechanics clearly, or I just cant do this, so Ill give a small analogy.The gameplay of SpaceChem is like solving a problem in a technical subject: computer science, physics, geometry, and the like. There is a clearly stated condition. There is a certain device that allows you to perform various operations. And most importantly, there is room for creativity. The gameplay of most games of this genre is to find the answer conceived by the authors. Here, there is no clear-cut framework for how to solve the proposed problem. Most of the SpaceChem levels can be completed in dozens, if not hundreds of different ways, and the emotions from the next successfully completed reaction are the same as from finding a solution to the very system of diffours that has been haunting for a couple of days.The emphasized cold and minimalistic design just creates the feeling that I'm sorry, you didnt come here to be entertained, but to engage in a business that requires a serious approach and concentration. In the stages with the construction of chemical plants, the game becomes even more complicated, forcing you to think in a slightly different plane and decide for yourself which molecules and in what order to load into the reactors, laying piping systems and choosing where to place the reactors.It is impossible not to mention the complexity. With a sufficiently high entry threshold, SpaceChem does not slow down throughout its entire length and constantly throws up increasingly complex and more non-trivial tasks, and at the end brazenly selects nights spent trying to at least find the right course of the reaction. A sort of Dark Souls puzzle world.In conclusion, I note that everyone who wants to stretch their brains loves games of this genre, interesting tasks and severe challenges, SpaceChem is simply recommended, unless of course you have heard of it before. The rest, I believe, does not make much sense to get acquainted with this game, and the plot can be read on the Internet."],["Pure LogicPura LgicaPure LogiqueBuy this game if you love the HARD Games of Logic...this game have Chemical Notions (very basic) and Visual Programing + CRAZY LOGIC,yo build Molecules, you bond + & - and make amazing stuffs.","Fun brain-stretcher","Very good puzzle game, but it is not easy.

I first picked up this game in 2015. I enjoyed the first few puzzles, until I ran headfirst into a difficulty spike on the third world. Quickly tiring of my inability to make progress, I moved on to other things, but it always kept nagging me in the back of my mind. I knew it was within my abilities, and I even tried to pick it up a couple times in the months afterward, but I was never really able to sink my teeth into it.Five years and an engineering degree later, I decided to revisit my old nemesis. I restarted the game and quickly progressed to the same wall I had hit in the past... and to my surprise, managed to blast through it. And the level after that. And all the way through to the end of the game. And the weirdest thing is I don't really think I'm any better at it now than I was five years ago. I think the difference is perspective.SpaceChem is absolutely a hard game. But I don't think it's hard because you need to be a genius to solve the puzzles. Instead it's hard because it demands lots of time and effort and is uncompromising in its expectations. Unlike other puzzle games, where there's often a eureka moment where you make a vital connection and the rest of the solution falls into place, every inch of progress in stitching your molecules together is hard won. You have to experiment, try different approaches, fail, tweak your designs, and sometimes tear it all down and start over with something completely new to get everything to work.It wasn't until I had worked on real world engineering problems that I truly appreciated what SpaceChem was asking of me. Once I did though, I came to love its challenges. The feeling of looking at a puzzle for the first time and wondering how the hell you're gonna even begin to solve it, then putting the last piece of your crazy contraption into place a few hours later and have the whole thing come together and just *work*...

SpaceChem doesn't deliver. I open a new level, keep looking at it, imagining that I can do it ineffeciently but still do it and keep staring at it in search of elegant \"aha!\" solution. Then I realize that no, it has to be done dirty, you just optimize said dirtyness. And thus you set it up, maybe see where you can cut few corners, run into visual space limits, groan, repeat. Rinse and repeat. I could be doing real programming, maybe with more actual \"oh, this would be elegant\" moments than this game.As of right now, I just can't push myself through another level, because yea. That's not entertainment for me. Dirty optimization may work for some like Factorio with bigger goal, but as separate puzzle levels... nah.

SpaceChem is life.This game is about using your programming skills to create space chemicals using waldos. This might sound simple on paper, but you're wrong. Very, very wrong. Because of two things:1. You only have limited space in a reactor, 80 tiles2. The programming language is in that space and is executed as your waldo moves along the symbols.This gives SpaceChem a very interesting challenge: how do you construct reagents with just this limited scope? And that challenge is just scratching the surface.You can only go over a specific tile twice: once horizontally, once vertically. You NEED to take advantage of this to do anything complex. Let's say you have N with a single bond, and you want it to have a triple bond. What you do is drop it onto some bonders through a grab\/drop horizontally, perform two bond + instructions, and then grab it vertically from the same tile of the grab\/drop. Now you're holding a triple bond N. Fantastic.Then the game drops a bombshell: fusion. Now you're performing addition with atoms. You can make almost anything as long as you have enough input reagents. Sikutar will break you.Then the game drops another bombshell: flip-flops.

If you;ve ever done any programming, try this...it's fun. and gets incredibly challenging."],["Long ago, computers filled rooms and program instructions were punched onto cards (which tended to be dropped onto the floor, and disorganized, just before an assignment deadline).  We students puzzled over some simple, assigned task, punched instructions onto our cards, and then \"ran\" the cards to see if our instructions would perform the task, or would instead just crash and produce an error message.   Few saw their cards run right the first time; most, instead, saw the dreaded error message, and then pored over their cards, trying to find a formatting or logical error to explain their little program's crash.    This game reminds me of that ancient experience.   Here, the \"coding\" we do is visual, and our instructions are easily placed onto paths of our own creation (mostly).  We have the freedom of imagination to instruct largely as we choose.   But when finished instructing, we must \"run\" our creation and see if we have succeeded usefully, or must instead pore over our design to solve a disclosed error.I suspect that if you were or are good at writing computer programs, you will feel oddly at home in this game.  But if you weren't or aren't good at programming?  This still presents yet another chance to bite at that cognitive apple, and it might prove to be a satisfying bite.  I believe this game can lead someone, if he or she has some imagination and resolve, to experience the same positive glow that one gets from happily seeing one's newborn program run successfully and elegantly to perform a targeted task.  I owned this game for a few years before I got around to trying it, which I did, for the first time, this evening.  I'm sorry it took me so long to try: it is a truly wonderful game.  Other Zachtronics games have been very good, too: but this one, surprisingly, may turn out to be my favorite. It has a similar feel to Opus Magnum, but it might be even more admitting of individual and distinct approaches.  And any game that can even approach Opus Magnum in that regard is a stellar choice indeed.  The tutorials are good.   I believe some reviewer said they do not \"hold your hand.\"   Well, they hold it a bit.   But they also expect you to start observing and pondering from the start.  This led, at least in my case, to a certain satisfaction and feeling of achievement even as I made my way through the series of tutorials (which I have about half-finished, so far, I believe).  Admittedly, however, at first I had to sit calmly and really pay attention to what was already on the screen, right in front of me, before I could realize what I should try next.     I'm glad that I didn't just give up in the first couple of minutes: this game would have been a terrible shame to miss.   As an interesting bonus, the game will remind of some light chemistry (although a knowledge of chemistry doesn't really seem necessary to play it).  It will remind of the periodic table and the individual elements within it.  Furthermore, the game will teach the chemical formulas of some real-life, important compounds -- and it will do that almost automatically, as progress in the game is made.  But despite the game's involvement with chemical formulas, the skills the game really calls upon feel to me much more like programming and planning skills.   Yet a foreknowledge of computer programming doesn't seem to be required in order to play and really enjoy the game.  Long story short?  I wrote this review immediately after my first session with it.   I've made good progress through the tutorials, but haven't finished them all yet.  Yet in this very first session of playing the game, it managed to engage me for hours.  If the tutorials are this much fun, I can hardly wait for the rest of the game to begin.  Zachtronics provides some games of real genius; this is yet another one of them.   Fortunately, one doesn't have to be a genius to enjoy this game; being fond of an interesting, well-designed series of challenges, and of learning by doing, seems enough.","Good for your brain"],["very good game"],["My favourite game ever made."],["This is a very specific type of game.
