The UI could use a little polish (it's forcing itself into a quarter of my screen, and the manual is fully separate, though it's a plus it can be printed). Code wise, I was slightly disappointed I can't use labels as values, but the ANY and LAST ports are a nice touch.","Just awesome! I'm a computer scientist doing mainly web work so this is really refreshing and challenging for me.However if you have no experience in low level programming be warned: You might learn a thing or two. ;)Apart from the gameplay the graphic and storytelling style just perfectly fits the epoch and the theme I'm going to finish the rest of the levels and after that I will probably dust off that old \"DIY\" operating system project I started a few years back.","This game is the childhood I longed for.","This game is amazing","If self flagellation is your cup of tea, buy this game and prepare to have your brain literally raped.It's all fun and games until you get to the sequence problems. I resorted to a \"novel\" solution (3000 cycles) for the first sequence problem, and it went downhill from there. An hour later after doing battle with this multiprocessing tight-looped behemoth, I'm seeing my coffee as a stack of distinct layers and wondering wether I should terminate with a 0 or preface with the length. Pascal style, baby.I love this and will fight it to the bitter end. I might even learn a few things on the way.Best educational game I ever played. Highly reccomended.","A game of solving realistic(ish) algorithmic problems by way of programming a fictional multiprocessor 70s PC called a TIS-100 in a limited assembly language.Niche, certainly, but if low-level code concepts don't make you run screaming from the building, then there is a hell of a good puzzle game here.  (Like other Zachtronics titles, expect it to get difficult quickly).Presentation and sound are a bit bare-bones, but this fits the theme perfectly.","I have zero coding experience and last night I made it past the first two levels. This is literally the Spacechem-type of \"Oh, god, it works!\" feeling but in a different medium. I see more of the familiar sweat and tears ahead, but the tradeoff is a sensation like no other.I missed this feeling and thought no other game could live up to Spacechem. Guess I was wrong. Thank you Zachtronics \/ Zach B.!","Zach is the god of open-ended puzzle games.","Way more fun than any assembly code simulator has any right to be.  When will Zachtronics games become too close to actual work to be fun?  So far, it hasn't happened.","The game is great, and I absolutely love it. Just buy it.The only thing I'm not a terribly big fan of is how non-robust solutions can skew the leaderboards, meaning you could create a solution which only works once for a particular set of random numbers, and as long as it passes your \"solution\" is accepted. It would be nice if the top solutions were run more rigorously in the cloud and removed if they couldn't stand up to a much larger data set.","I'm disappointed this isn't on Linux yet. I know it's Early Access but I really wish developers would start treating it like a priority platform :(Otherwise it's the same kind of fun as SpaceChem. Which is awesome. Great game.","It's an assembly programming puzzle game. For me that is a wonderous combination of timely help with my studies, and really difficult ... in both cases becuase I've been studying assembly lately and struggling with it. I'm not giving up yet and TIS-100 has already helped a little :DBesides that, this game is amazing work, even just the EA, cheers!","This is how I wanted games like Uplink to be. An actual programming game. It reminds me of when your elementary school computer teacher gave you things to try to make in LOGO, but instead of geometry problems you're doing other kinds of problems. Highly recommend this game, it's really satisfying.","A text adventure. A mystery story. An everyman's hacking exercise. TIS-100 stimulates the mind, inspiring new thought processes in a beautiful way.","It's assembly. Literally assembly. If you have ever touched or looked at assembly in your life then firstly I'm sorry and secondly you're the target for this game!If not, this is a great time to learn! I mean you're here, aren't you? It might take you a little longer to get a grasp of the concepts (and yes you will need to consult the manual) but at its core TIS-100 is another excellent puzzle game from Zachtronics; this time a bit more literally about programming.","Time to put on your hacker hat!If you have no experience or interest in programming whatsoever, this is a bad place to start getting it and you should probably skip this title in that case, as I don't think you'll enjoy it.However, if you are a programmer (having experience with assembler helps), this game will give you a good challenge, as it forces you to make do with a bunch of linked CPU nodes, with only a few really basic instructions and a single register, to do ever more complex tasks.Graphically it's a bit simple (as it is mostly a retro textmode display you'll be working with), but a real hacker doesn't care about graphics, right?All in all a good title that will give you many hours of ASM hacking fun.","TIS-100 is an assembly programming puzzle game which requires no previous knowledge of programming (meaning everything you need to know is explained in the manual). Once you start the game, you actually just virtually start up the TIS-100 machine (e.g. you'll get a boot screen and the like).As you can see from the screenshots, the game is entirely text-based, but the beauty of the game lies in what happens in your mind. Zachtronics managed to keep things interesting from the outset, hinting at a mystery lying somewhere in the machine and prompting you to print out the manual as first thing (something I truly encourage, too).The TIS-100 architecture is made up of several different nodes (small square panels). You generally get some values as input and you have to handle\/modify them in order to obtain the required output. As in SpaceChem, there are of course several limitations which will hamper your task: each node can contain up to 16 lines of code, you must synchronize the communication over the port between nodes... you get the picture.I played through 6 levels, and things are beginning to get spicy. I'm perfectly aware that this game \"isn't for everyone\" but what Zachtronics game was? If you liked SpaceChem and are interested in low level programming, you'll fall in love with this game. If you haven't tried SpaceChem and are unsure if pure programming might appeal to you in the long run, I would suggest starting off with SpaceChem or Infinifactory, before moving on to TIS-100, because they probably feel more \"fun\" in the traditional sense of the word.TL;DR If you are interested in low level\/assembly programming, this game will probably be a great way to have fun with it. :)","This glorious little game, while well-crafted, polished, and solid, has probably the thinnest veneer of any of the Zachtronics Engineering Puzzle Games (Infinifactory, SpaceChem, etc).  It's a parallel assembly language programming puzzle game on a fictional tiled CPU retrocomputer with simple (and limited) instruction set and IO resources.  The tutorial is a link to the (awesome) reference manual for the TIS-100.  The controls are little editor windows to type your assembly language programs into.  There is much fun to be had.The instruction set is stylistically similar to real machines, but clearly chosen to be as minimally daunting as possible.  The focus is on simple arithmetic operations, basic flow control, and IO with adjacent CPU nodes or peripherals.  Amusingly, this simplicity may make it more challenging for people with actual assembly programming background in that solving these puzzles can involve approaching things in ways very different from how one might on a \"real\" computer.It's probably most easily enjoyed by someone with a bit of programming experience, but the system is straightforward enough that someone interested in figuring out how things work should have a reasonable chance of doing so.Be sure to read the manual.  Really.After 20 hours of game time I've managed to solve all 20 of the original puzzles (a few of them are incredibly evil) and the secret puzzle that definitely was not added in the June 4th update.  There are still a few I plan to go back and optimize some more.  Already got more than my money's worth of entertainment out of TIS-100 -- any further additions will just be icing on the (delicious, not a lie) cake.","I love the old-school feeling this game provides. The puzzles seem like typical problems to solve from the era, and the code and debug info is clean and understandable. The up front knowledge you need to have is minimal and the manual was a quick read. This isn't a game for people not interesting in programming. I can't wait to get deeper in the game and unlock more of the story as well.","I do this stuff for a living, so it should be boring. It really should.But just opening up the manual BEFORE THE GAME STARTED made me giggle a little bit - It's so accurate!The puzzles are good, as I've come to expect from Zachtronics. I haven't gotten very far but I already know this is an excellent game.Play this if you* Know some ASM but never use it anymore. It's more fun than you remember.* Know a little bit about programming and want to dig deeper* Love logic puzzles and don't mind reading a bit of documentation (It's short and well-written)* Are fascinated by the innards of that computer machine of yours","An incredibly clever puzzle game, just what I loved in SpaceChem but with assembler commands.Only downside : you need 40 Floppy disk to store the game :(","Finally, a Zachtronics game you can probably get away with playing at work.It's got everything you'd expect: simple mechanics, tricky puzzles, a fun story, and those damn graphs that show you how many people are smarter than you are.","Great puzzle game with a ton of room for experimentation - exactly what you'd expect from Zachtronics. Really cool presentation and an interesting plot that's subtly revealed along the way.If you've practiced the dark arts of programming in the past (Assembly in particular), you're likely to pick up on what this game is putting down a bit more readily, but it's by no means a requirement. The instruction set is limited enough in scope that anyone with a mind for puzzle games should be able to quickly ramp up on how things operate as long as you're not opposed to reading the manual.","Based on the promise of a Linux port ** I give this game a few  mega thumbs up.First, if you have never done any code work  do not be put off by the talk of assembly code or programming. This is a puzzle game of the best kind.Did you like SpaceChem or any of the other Zachtronic games? If so then drop your cash in the Steam slot and strap in.But if you do  remember learning z80 assembler code, working in cramped memory spaces, shifting bits about and page flipping anis this game is  going to make you either really happy or suddenly suicidal. In a good way though.And then there is the mystery of the  machine itself. Ruh Roh.Note bene...Print out the manual. Not only is it a great bit of tat it will help in the early stages. (**Linux comrades, the game works under wine well enough until the promised native son is delivered. yes wine sucks and I am not fond of using it, for this though I will make the case for it. )","I've loved all of his other games, and this game is even better than Infinifactory. Of course, I work in assembly language all day, and solve puzzles like this as my day job, so I might already be crazy. Still, great game! The opcodes do have a passing similarity to common opcodes used, although the syntax is a little different. Highly recommended.","I bought this as soon as I saw it was from Zachronics.  At first, I was horrified and feared I had made a mistake because I am no programmer.  Aside from a couple classes over a decade ago, I have little experience.  Despite this, after skimming through the manual, I was able to complete the first few puzzles.  After reading the manual more closely, I got a few more.  I anticipate with a little more tinkering, I can get even further.It's a fun game that doesn't exactly teach you programming, but you learn a bit anyway.  The excitement I feel when I finally figure out a puzzle is easily worth the tiny price of admission.  If you like the developer's other titles, chances are this is right up your alley, even if that's not immediately apparent.","Another top-notch game by Zachtronics. Came for the finely written manual, stayed for the great puzzles.","Great game if you like low-level programming.","Once again, it seems that the geniuses (genius?) behind Zachtronics Industries managed to turn the nerdiest concept ever into a incredibly satisfying puzzle-game.Can't wait to see how this one will evolve. In the meanwhile, I'm already having a blast !","A parallel-processing game for (wanna-be) engineers!As a programmer who enjoys dabbling in assembly, I'm already having a blast with this game. I don't really know of any real-world technologies that allow parallel processing but are as straightforward as this one, so it's quite unique as a learning tool\/toy.The conspiracy plot reminds me of Neuromancer (the game) or Uplink, and the 80s style manual (which you actually need to print out) is charming. The interface while spartan is very effective, though it would be nice if there were more options for moving forward and backward in the running code.But... it is a game about writing assembly code, and its hard to recommend this over SpaceChem for the true beginner. If you've already digested that game, or you've learned the basics of programming through something like Hour of Code, then TIS-100 is a fun, challenging and novel puzzle game.","Puzzles based on a subset of assembler on a fictitious node cluster. Assembler Microservices if you will.So basically my day job, minus the monthly paycheck.I'll be waiting for v1.0 with more opcodes and better puzzles.","I LOVE U ZACH","Puzzles based on a subset of assembler on a fictitious node cluster.

TIS-100 is a game for programmers by programmers. Fun if you can program, I have no clue how this will work for non programmers.","This is a delightful little three-tier puzzler.  First layer is basic solutions, second layer is optimizations, third layer is a meta-puzzle of finding out where the device came from... don't let the ASM-ish language scare you off -- it is just a set of tools for solving puzzles, and the puzzles are fun.  Game takes no resources or graphics power, so a great game to just leave open as a fun distraction between (things).The pacing is rather good once you get you grasp the UI and get your first basic application running.  Players must realize that poking around the UI and having a manual that is minimalist is a part of the game.","Deadlock: the game. Love it.","Wow - Zachtronics have done it again.  This game is fiendishly clever in concept and execution. It looks really complicated, but is well explained by the progressive levels (and funny manual). I am only 9 levels in, but can already tell they're taking the puzzles in really cool directions.","This game is incredibly interesting. I have barely cracked the surface of this game but so far I am loving this game. Anyone that has any interest in programming should give this game a shot. It's simplified assembly makes it easy to get started and the complexity of the computer's node and pipe system allows you to have tons of variety in your solutions. The best thing about the game is the way it tracks the statistics for how well your program runs with the number of cycles, number of nodes used and the number of instructions used. This allows for a lot of replayability in each problem to try and improve upon each category.","A game about programming.Wait, no, don't run off!! It's ok, come back. Let me explain a bit.This is a logic\/puzzle game, that is based around the concept of programming.You do not need to know how to \"program\" to play. It's essentially about keeping track of numbers coming from Point A, and then figuring out how to get it to Point B in the correct order. You might learn some bits of programming from playing this, but you shouldn't feel like it's required to play.There's even a story embedded in the game, from the old-time manual (with hand-written notes in it), to \"corrupted\" squares that have some story bits. I'm probably still really early into the game, but I already love it. Very  clever system. It is not easy though! And I can already see parts where I want to try to figure out how to make my previous solutions \"better\". This really might help someone learn programming concepts, but I don't want to say that in case it scares people away.Really, it's a clever and unique logic\/puzzle game that is totally worth it.","All the fun of assembler programming without accomplishing anything.Highly recommend.","This is the natural continuation of what Zachtronics has been working towards for years now. SpaceChem and Infinifactory work you into the idea of solving complex temporal and spatial puzzles through a sequence of simple motions, and TIS-100 steps it up a notch by introducing textual syntax to it and adding additional layers.I've been working in assembly for a few years now and these puzzles will still make you swear, think and celebrate when you solve them. Given only a single directly accessible register is really the magic to this game, as even the most simple actions require multiple nodes to complete.The progression is gradual enough to introduce people interested in the concept to what they are getting into, but ultimately the target audience are people who have some background in programming.","TIS-100 is a unique puzzle game that involves writing short, simple programs to control the flow of data across nodes to meet goals. Some nodes will be corrupted, adding a level of difficulty to the game and forcing you to get creative and concise with how you structure your programs.In addition to being a fun game, TIS-100 is a great introduction to the basics of writing Assembly code for any who are interested. The game comes with a .pdf file that clearly documents the various different commands, what they do, and how to use them. The .pdf even has a couple of sample programs to show how they're structured for those that are completely unfamiliar with it. ------------------------------------------------------------------You can print the .pdf, staple the pages together, and leave it on your desk if you want to look like a genius to people who enjoy nosing through your stuff. \"Hey man, what's this I found on your desk?\" They ask curiously.\"Oh, that old thing? That's just the reference manual for the tesselated intelligence system, I've already written sequence generator and signal multiplexer software for it. It's no big deal,\" You reply as you slick your hair back.\"Wow dude, you're so smart. Here's a large bag of currency.\"------------------------------------------------------------------It's definitely not a game for everybody. If you don't have the right mind for thinking programmatically you might have some trouble, but if you're interested in programming and you want a fun way to learn the basics of Assembly, this game is worth looking into.","Fun, fun, fun!  Kind of reminiscent of A. K. Dewdney's Core War I think.  If you've ever done any assembly language programming, or ever been interested in it, this game is a neat thing to play around with.  If you've never done any programming, you might want to google \"assembly language programming\" before buying this game.  This game will not be for everyone, but it's affordable, and worth a look.  I think this would be a nice educational tool for schools also.I think it visualizes what is happening in the debugger pretty well.  Some people have problems picturing registers, memory locations and so on, but the user interface here depicts how some of these kinds of things work well enough for an interested newbie to figure out.  I'm not an assembly guru, but I've had a bit of experience with Z80 and MC68HC11 years ago, and was able to get through the first three puzzles pretty quickly here.  To an oldtimer like me from the eighties, this game brings back some memories!It also seems to have a little espionage\/murder mystery element to it:  the manual pdf that is included has some background story, and clicking on the debug buttons in malfunctioning nodes appears to pull up some clues to the meta game aspect, although I haven't gotten far in that direction yet.For a little flavor of the old days, check out The Story of MelI recommend this game to anyone with an interest in computer programming.","SpaceChem in assembly language form. Actually quite fun for something so esoteric.","So far it brings great memories from CS. Occam, transputers, ASM... Then it goes to parallel systems.Pls, workshop needed NOW! So I can transcribe my assignments.But... I guess there is something lurking inside. OMG... What is this blinking light?","Really fun!","This game is really neat, but I imagine it's only for a certain type of person. The people who are going to like this are the people who like having to figure things out for themselves and create a working mechanism out of nothing in an open environment. The process of writing a program to solve a puzzle can be frustrating, but it's all worth it when  you run the modified program for the umpteenth time and watch the correct answers come out. It's a great feeling when you finally solve the puzzle and get to check out the next set of longer, harder puzzles. If you like cerebral, slow paced games with great payoff, you're going to want to check this one out.","Apparently my job involving Fortran coding on a daily basis is not challenging enough. So let's pay 7 bucks and buy a game where you have to learn a new assembler language to solve friggin' signal processing problems. Of course no one asked for this game. Of course I don't want to code after a long day. Why would I buy this game? If I want a coding challenge I can actually just go and work.So, naturally I bought the game. What am I doing with my life? Well, here goes nothing...I have a TIS-100 type model which is a complete mystery. It comes with a 14-page instruction manual which is surprisingly immersive, no mentioning that this is a game and all. The manual explains what's going down and how to code on the nodes, adding some handwritten notes from my dead uncle Randy. Too bad, he was a cool guy, I guess. Of course there are references to works that explain the architecture in more detail. Sadly those documents are not supplied so I'm left guessing on that end.The language is super easy. It emulates a very low-spec version of an assembly language. It has a total of 13 instructions involving simple conditionals, arithmetics and I\/O operations. You even have some labels to build loops and gotos inside a node (although the ability to push to more than one node offers cool loop mechanisms, too). You even get a rudimentary debugger (breaking points and cycle-wise forwarding) that makes bugfixing easy.My job is to repair corrupted segments of code in the machine to unlock... more segments. In each level there is a themed puzzle (first creating simple things like sequencers, then you detect signals from noise and later you are actually decrypting stuff). Puzzles are solved by writing machine code that solves a given objective. Feels like first semester home work all over again. Yay. All the segments come with debugging messages that have nothing to do with debugging (they are flavor texts revealing some background info about the meta game) and in the end I got a great reveal what the fuzz was all about.If you are unfamiliar with writing code this game will probably drive you crazy (no tutorial but the manual). If you have a basic idea how assembly works you are fine. If you are coding on a daily basis and buy this game... you're probably insane.Other than that I think the idea of the game is kind of cool, although it's very short for 7 bucks. A few additional puzzles would've been great, it was surprisingly entertaining solving them. I would talk about graphics but there are none. I should talk about sound but there's a total of 4 different sounds in the game, so... Yeah, sound's cool. I recommend listening to death metal while playing it.","I'll gonna print the TiS-100 manual out.10\/10 would print more documents.","MOV GAME, STEAMACCT","A new wonderfull game, which possesses the same DNA of Spacechem and Infinifactory.You enjoyed one of Zachtronics' game ?You'll like this new game for sure.","Anything from Zachtronics is practically a must buy for me. The puzzles are hard but oh so rewarding, and then there's the world of difference between just solving them and doing them _well_. I can see I'm going to be spending a long time on this one.","Really captures the fun of programming without all of the stuff that makes you tear your hair out trying to get work done on real platforms.  Very nostaligic for older programmers who learned on the first home computers.I think just about anyone who likes programming would enjoy it, and anyone who's good at programming will breeze through it in a pleasant evening or two (though then you can compete at optimizing your programs, which I don't think I'll do since it's a bottomless timesink).If you're not already a programmer, you may find it quite challenging, but you may also stretch your mind and discover a talent for it.  A wonderful game which I fully expect many future programmers to credit as a formative experience.","This game is difficult and it runs on my computer.","Get it for cheap, and if you're not a computer nerd then don't bother. There's nothing particularly surprising here if you looked at the pictures and the video. It is what it is. Also, the assembly language used only has a small handful of very basic instructions, so if you like assembly you may not get what you're looking for here.The puzzles are fun, though.","This would have been awesome for one of my Intro to Computer something in my EE courses. As someone who has programmed in assembler for work and hobbies, The instruction set it pretty tiny and with them only an F1 popup away, easy to get used to. I like the scoreboards too to see how you did in terms of cycles executed, number of instructions and cores used. Reminds me of the Portal 2 challenege stats.If you have zero programming experience you're probably going to have a hard time. (That's probably obvious with a programming game) If you're good at logic puzzles and can figure out how perform various math using only adding and subtracting, you'll probably be able to pick up on it fairly quick.I wish there was an ncurses version of this so I could run it in a real terminal window (something I could SSH to).It definately makes me appriciate machines with multiple addressible registers though. It would be nice if I didn't have to manually open the PDF (Linux specific thing? xdg-open $filepath). Today's update has more puzzles, I'd better get to it.","Assembly + Logical Circuits!","Zachtronics is at it again!This indie studio is amazing. Zachtronics consistantly pumps out awesome super-open-ended puzzlers that aren't unlike programming machines. It started with The Bureau of Steam Engineering, KOHCTPYKTOP, and The Codex of Alchemical Engineering. All three are free flash games you can find on his site. Next came Spacechem, a true gem. Then came Infinifactory, which is not unlike Spacechem in 3D.Now we have TIS-100. This one is his first \"literal programming\" entry. Using somewhat-basic programming, your goal is to build a program out of commands that look similar to Assembly in order to take certain input numbers, manipulate them in some way, then output them. As a basic example, you might add two inputs together and output the sum.The game is certainly built with a programmer in mind, and it uses a bunch of mini-environments rather than the usual single environment. As such, I would not recommend it to someone unfamiliar with programming, especially if you're looking to learn programming. However, I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone with programming experience, even if it's only a little experience. (I also recommend Zachtronics entire library; they're all completely genius (Except for Ironclad Tactics...that one just kinda rubbed me the wrong way))","MOV RECOMMENDS,ACCADD 1MOV ACC,RECOMMENDS","Great and challenging game by the developer of SpaceChem. Makes my head hurt. 10\/10 would buy again.","Another excellent game by Zachtronics.  Very minimalist interface, very enjoyable puzzles.  You don't need to know anything about programming to play.It's getting to be where I buy Zachtronics games sight-unseen, they're all so good.","Do you yearn for the days when a computer was programming at the lowest of levels?Do you like solving challenges about tight code optimisation?Are you excited by screens of plain old text?Did you answer yes to all of those? Then you're probably going to love this game. From the included reference manual, marked up with notes, to the desire to optimise your code routines as fast as you can, this game will totally challenge the old grey matter, and get you hooked.And yes, I am a programmer by day - but there's nothing more important than going back to one's roots, and this game let you do that without having to go deal with overinflated prices for old microcomputers online.","Beautiful as a puzzler, great as a programming logic teaching tool too. Top notch.","8\/8","TIS-100 is for anyone who likes a good puzzle. It's challenging, but not unfair. Don't let the code push you away, even if you're not a programmer you'll have a great time.","After having a not-so-pleasant experience with an early access game purchased earlier this week, I was very delighted to find that this game was extremely well-polished for still being in early access. In fact, the only thing keeping this game from being released already is just more puzzles -- note, this doesn't mean there isn't enough content to purchase the game already; the puzzles are not easy puzzles that can be completed within a few minutes. In order to play through this game, thinking is crucial. While many other puzzle games strive for this, TIS-100 is the only puzzle game that I can say truly forces you to think outside the box. Although this game might not be for you if you're not a fan of hard-thinking, concentration, and patience, it's really great fun for people looking for a challenging puzzle game that will have them stumped on every level. The developers have taken a very minimalist concept and created a fantastic game out of it. Throughout the game you'll find yourself trying to figure out how you've botched up the current level, only to realize that you completely overthought the entire problem and that the solution was right under your nose all along, which leaves you with a wonderful feeling of success as soon as you've finished it.For you programmers out there: I cannot recommend this game enough. It teaches you great debugging skills and complex logic, as well as how to hack the crap out of such a simple machine.","This won't teach you how to code. If you like the idea of coding, it's a fun set of brain teasers for a weekend.","Wow my brain hurts... Thank you. Please more levels, I want to play this game for the rest of my life.","This is exactly the game about assembly language programming I've always wanted. The presence of histograms and leaderboards transform TIS-100 (which my friend and I like to refer to as \"Assembly Simulator 1980\") from 'a fun diversion for a few hours' to 'basically crack cocaine'. I haven't finished many of the later puzzles because I've poured far too much time into optimizing my solutions for the earlier ones. Send help.","An absolutely brilliant work. Simple, but brilliant.The problems are inially easy, simple to solve. However, they become harder, and you must be prepared to spend a lot of time coming up with solutions, and fixing them when you inevitably discover your soluion contains countless bugs! There are many different ways to solve a problem, but some have lower cycle time, some have lower instruction count, and some are simpler but slower. This inherintly means even if you solve a problem, you have plenty of reason to go back and ... optimize.This game's not for everyone. There are no flashy graphics, or cool music, and the story, although reflective of your experience playing the game, is nothing to write home about. All this game contains is logic puzzles, albiet in a nicely presented way. If you like those sorts of things, you'll like the game, otherwise, all you'll find is headaches and frustration!Conclusion : For 6 dollars, it's a good pickup if you like logic puzzle games.","Not your avarage overly simplistic video game but almost too realistic to be fun. It feels a look like work, to be honest. As a novice high-level programmer who gets easily confused when it comes to boolean logic and who has never had anything to do with assembly, this game is a nightmare come true for me. Nonetheless, the game itself is quite something and very well worth a try.","Nerdgasm!!!","This is both challenging and oddly satisfying. A+","only slightly less hostile than PIC ASM10\/10","An programming\/optimizing puzzle game in the vein of Zachtronics' other games SpaceChem and Infinifactory, TIS-100 has players writing minimalist assembly code, building multi-threaded subroutines to power a mysterious retro computer, complete with xeroxed, hand-annotated instruction manual. Maybe not for everyone, but I'm just head over heels in love with everything about it. If you enjoyed SpaceChem and\/or Infinifactory, this is a pretty obvious recommendation!","We all know programming can be fun! This game embodies that fun \\o\/","Let me just start off by saying that unless you are a programmer by heart or have prior experience with programming in Assembly, this game may come across as overly confusing and not very fun.That being said, even with only basic knowledge of the Intel 8086 Assembly instruction set, I found this game to be very fun (and still challenging) to play.TIS-100 essentially uses a simplified version of Assembly with basic instructions, including  Control flow (JMP, JEZ, JNZ, JGZ, JLZ, JRO) Arithmetic (ADD, SUB, NEG), Data storage (MOV, SWP, SAV),  And some cycle fillers (NOP, ADD NIL).It's largely to your own benefit that you read the entire manual (it's not that long) when you start the game. Other than that, you are given no other direction on how to play. There are currently 20 programs that you must write, starting with fairly simply MOV operations to sequence counters to sequence detection, etc. Each program has a short list of instructions that you must follow to complete the program and move on.I've spent about a good afternoon straight playing and gotten to level 11. The program difficulty is increasing significantly with each passing level, so I have no doubt that it will take quite a bit longer to beat.Anyway, I fully encourage any programmer to give this game a try. It's fun and occupies time fairly well.","Ok, I know at first glance, this looks like a really lame \"game\" and not very fun. It definitely has a niche appeal. You don't actually have to know how to program, though. Just how to think logically and learn. It's surprisingly fun to solve puzzles in assembler. It's more fun to do it in a more efficient way than your friends.","A good game for introducing those with no prior programming experience to assembly language.","The combination of 8-bit cpu-like opcodes with 12 cores and message passing make this a real gem.  Will you optimize node use, speed, or opcodes? Why not try all three?If you remember assembly fondly, this is awesome. If you've always been intrigued by it, this is a great intro.","Yet another brilliantly done puzzler from ZachTronics.For anyone intrigued by logic puzzles, this is pure gold. While this is an Early Access title, it certainly feels complete to me. I have nearly 7 hours in as of this review, and haven't finished half of it. This is another example of how completely engrossing video games can be made with almost no graphics (i.e. Sanctuary RPG).As soon as you boot up this 'game', you are encouraged to print out a PDF 'manual' for this mysterious microcomputer found on your (recently deceased) uncle's workbench. You really do need to print it out, mind you. This manual reads exactly like the cliff notes for a simplified programming language - it is essentially the tutorial for the game. It has charming hand-written notes and highlights that your uncle made. It really builds mystery in an elegant way.Protip: If you take the plunge with this title, be sure to stay away from the forums - the best part is figuring out the puzzles for yourself!Don't get it twisted - this game is hella hard! It will make your brain twist in ways you didn't think possible. The only way I would not recommend it is if you have had previous experience with programming, and really hated it.So do the indie gaming industry, and yourself, a favor - purchase this right away to support a great developer and get yourself an absolutely fantastic game. I very much look forward to whatever else is in store for this title!","This is my favorite Zachtronics game yet. SpaceChem was great but eventually the solution space became too open and sprawling. With TIS-100, there's always just the right mix of flexibility and constraint. Perhaps paradoxically, this makes it much more like a game than SpaceChem despite surface appearances.","Seems like a fun way to learn assembly, with a cool parallel processing element which I'm sure will add intrigue later on. Innovative and really challenging (in a good way). Just what I've come to expect from Zachtronics.","Great puzzle game.You're given 13 different commands that you can program with to solve various tasks. You have 12 different windows which you can add the commands in. If you've played spacechem its sort of like that, only with numbers instead. Very easy to learn, but finding the perfect way to do the tasks can be challenging.","(WARNING: This review is after having played only about 2 hours in.)Geeky puzzle solving fun - super special interest though.  Given a very simple assembly language with an instruction set of only about 12 kinds of opcode, but with a message-queuing parallel archetecture, and little cpu's running your small programs that pass each other data, solve the given problem.It's basically like Talos Principle or Portal, but for computer nerds.And if you're a programmer who only ever played a little bit with programming and never did any assembly, it's a good basic intro to the concept.But again, sadly, it will probably only ever have a very niche market.","This game is awesome, having a small set of assembly-like instructions and only a couple registers forces you to think hard even for some of the easiest tasks. Trying to optimize the code to effectively use concurrency can be a fun challenge too and the graphs shows how your code compare to others in terms of cycle, node and instruction count.If you are a programmer just buy this game and you'll absolutely love it, if you aren't it could take some more time to figure out some 'tricks' to solve the levels, but the manual explains everything you need to know. +1 also for linux support, this is probably my happiest purchase ever on steam.","If you think it'd be cool to solve programming puzzles in some simplified assembly language, then you are going to love this game. The puzzles are not too hard, but optimizing can be really challenging and multple solutions can give correct answers with different tradeoffs. The language is easy to learn but tough to master. If you have no idea what this is about, imagine trying to combine simple building blocks (in the form of written computer instructions) to make a computing node then combine multiple nodes to do some calculation. You can build some surprisingly complex functions this way. If you are not at all familiar with programming you will need to read a tutoriall and some help. All that is required is the desire to solve this kind of puzzle and some curiosity.10\/10, worth your money and your time!","I really like all Zachtronics games but TIS-100 is a contraversial game, so I didn't buy it until a friend advised me to do so.Contrary to all previous games of Zach, TIS-100 has no graphics or music, at all. So, in order to justify its cost the puzzles have to be great.And they are, indeed. They are satisfyingly tough (much like SpaceChem) and unlike eachother, so each time is a new challenge.Yet there are 3 flaws of the game, you are advised to know these before buying TIS-100.* The game is a little too short as of now. Hope it'll be extended until release.* No graphic interface means the mechanics of the game are much less intuitive. You need to rely on your memory. Not good if you want to take a break for a few months then come back, as you'll have to re-learn a lot of the stuff.* There are no intro levels and the manual isn't well designed for a person with no coding background, like me. At first you don't understand what you're supposed to do. But even I got the hang of it in 20 minutes.","xor eax, eax; div eax; \/ 10","A great game if you enjoy programming. Even if you don't know any programming languages.The game uses a very simple and easy version of assembler and teaches you how to use it very well.Yet another great Zachtronics game!","This is a very cool unusual game that's been my recent obsession.  It's not much more than an emulator and set of tests for a fictional processor (the TIS-100 of the title).  However, this processor was designed to be easy to learn but hard to use, turning the process of writing basic programs on it into a puzzle.I can definitely imagine non-programmers having a hard time.  Reading the manual is a must.  It's not long.","Just brilliant!","As an amateur programmer, this game is amazing. As a Spacechem\/puzzle fan, this game is amazing. As a total nerd, this game is amazing.","If you love challenging logic puzzles than this game is the right one for you.Besides some smaller issues, like editing sometimes blocks because of trailing whitespaces and you have to delete them first, this game is challenging.

The polish is there, it could just use a bit more content.","This gem of a game is something that popped up in my inbox yesterday. It's also one of the *many* reasons I love Zachtronics. Their puzzle games have always intrugued me. This one no less.While I have never worked with Assembly before, learning the TIS-100 language was surprisingly easy. Especially with the quick reference by pressing F1. I can definitely recommend recommend this to people who like programming and logic puzzles. If you are not that kind of person, you may want to carefully consider if this game is for you.If you ever find yourself in love with this game, make sure to take a look at these two games by Zachtronics:http:\/\/www.zachtronics.com\/kohctpyktop-engineer-of-the-people\/http:\/\/www.zachtronics.com\/ruckingenur-ii\/There's also a third game which I love, much like Infinifactory but in 2D.  I forgot the name, and it sadly seems to be gone from the website.","I've really enjoyed this game so far. As a computing science student who's just finished my first year, which included a small class on MIPS assembly language, this is still pretty challenging. Might be slightly too difficult for someone with no programming experience and the wrong mindset for the type of problems that assembly language programming can present. But then again I was never very good at MIPS anyway.","As a programmer myself, I can't say anything else than : PLAY. THIS.

This means that most people won't take the time to understand it  (it's about as accessible as a brick), but if you do, you will find it rewarding (and you will feel completley superior to everyone else).","Another gem from the mastermind(s) at Zachtronics. SpaceChem and Infinifactory are among my favourite games of all time, and TIS-100 distills the SpaceChem formula into its most basic structure. It is a very basic looking game, considering its Assembly theme, but even with its limited focus, there is an incredibly diverse set of challenges here that will leave you scratching your head and forget about time while you work your programs bit by bit (pun alert) towards the the goal you need to achieve.These games are challenging and trial and error wont get you far. Learn the rules, learn to bend the rules to its maximum without breaking them and lose yourself thinking over minute details.","As someone who programs for a living, this is a horrible, horrible idea. I come home after a long day and program something that doesn't even give real world results? ....10\/10, highly recommend.","Fun.Back in time, the real world of hacking was something like this.

Now you can happily return to frag , p0w, grinding ecc. because you're a kid and now you know who you are. Let the real fun to real adults.","Keep in mind this game is not easy. The difficulty curve is high. If you like esoteric programming languages, you will love this. It consists of simple boxes, each able to communicate with each other and function on two memory cells (one of which is difficult to access for no apparent reason). The hitch is, each box can only contain a limited number of lines and they have to communicate to accomplish things.This game is greatly worth it if you are a programmer by hobby, profession, or interest. Be completely aware before buying it that there's a high chance it will go entirely over your head- that almost happened to me. Otherwise it's a greatly difficult puzzle game that keeps you engaged and angry.","You should buy this game in a heartbeat if you like puzzle game and any of the following: (low level) Programming Retrocomputing ElectronicsHowever, even a non programmer can enjoy this game thanks of the limited instruction set, so give it a go if you like highly logical puzzle.The atmosphere in the game is spot on, and have a really nice 70's feel, as well as some kind of plot.The game's lifespan is already good, because you can replay any level to find a better solution (a graph show you how well your solution perform against other).What I feel is lacking for now is a longer tutorial, especially for non programmers. I would like some kind of ambiance sound  \/ music as well, but hey, it's in early access so I can't complain too much.","F*CK YEAHDebugging without those pesky deadlines or coworkers...MOV T, RIGHTMOV H, LEFTX:MOV I , UPMOV S, DOWNJMP XAWESOME;10\/10 = 1 (true) Should debug again","awesome. i really love this kind of stuff. there will be a lot of space for complex solutions :D","More awesome stuff from Zachtronics. It's not nearly as accessible as SpaceChem or Infinifactory, but it's not geared to as wide an audience either. I'll be looking forward to the main release. The puzzles given were a lot of fun and interested, but there weren't a whole lot of them. The amount of challenge is nice, but could be ramped up higher for even more fun.","A puzzle game in which you do simple tasks using an unusual computer. An unusual computer that makes a low-end ATtiny look like a veritable powerhouse. It makes the register machine model look positively feature-rich.Fun stuff! It probably won't take too long to actually solve most of the problems, but I've spent faaaar too long fiddling with them to get better numbers. Also still in development apparently, although it feels finished.","TIS-100 has the distilled essence of Zachtronics' earlier games - solving logical problems with limited tools and with hard constraints - for anyone who finds logic problem solving a rewarding challenge this is superb brain candy. For anyone old enough to have experienced it, this brings back memories of 6502 assembly and the rush of figuring out how to save a handful of cycles by cleverly rearranging a few instructions. (If that doesn't sound fun then this is probably not for you).The current early access set of 20 puzzles was nicely paced but left me hungry for more - I'm looking forward to seeing where it goes!","If you enjoy puzzle solving, coding, or want to understand why people might enjoy writing computer programs, definitely check this out. Easily the most original puzzle game I've seen.","I need a life, this is more amusing to me than most modern high graphic games.. :(","This game is great! If you've messed with any kind of assembly (I tinkered briefly with Core Wars and then gave up) it's very simple to pick up at least the first ten or so challenges, and I imagine even if you haven't it becomes pretty clear, the architecture is quite simple, but entertaining.

This is incredibly fun and challenging.","Played this briefly and I can already tell this is going to be one of my favorite games. The in game assembly language is simple and can be picked up in minutes. That being said, It still could be useful in teaching some core concepts to people interested in assembly programming.

I enjoyed their earlier game, SpaceChem and this is an assembler programming-inspired counterpart to that chemistry-inspired game. As with SpaceChem, this is a puzzle game for people who want a challenge.The documentation (PDF file in game directory, prompted when starting the game) is required reading, and is useful to keep in a separate window for the first few segments. You can use F1 in-game to open a quick reference that shows all instructions.Prior assembly or programming experience can be useful, but only for giving you experience in thinking in small logical steps.If you are unsure about the game, I have a Youtube series going where I explain the puzzles in the game in a relatively accessible way, aimed at new players who got stuck.

As with SpaceChem, this is a puzzle game for people who want a challenge.The documentation (PDF file in game directory, prompted when starting the game) is required reading, and is useful to keep in a separate window for the first few segments. You can use F1 in-game to open a quick reference that shows all instructions.Prior assembly or programming experience can be useful, but only for giving you experience in thinking in small logical steps.If you are unsure about the game, I have a Youtube series going where I explain the puzzles in the game in a relatively accessible way, aimed at new players who got stuck. This is also a pretty decent way to see if you would like the game.https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=6yZPagN5lC8&list=PLPo00Kvl9Ha2L-p3FzG9_Kdi8UyjVQTPD&index=1","Another amazing optimization puzzler from Zachtronics that gives you more direct control over every \"node\" as you shift things around. Simplified little assembly instructions let you build adorable little snippets to parse and deliver the puzzle objectives. This is one of the most intellectually stimulating yet somehow oddly relaxing puzzlers I've played in a while. Well, not since SpaceChem really. Zachtronics really sets the standard for puzzle games that I wish more would follow.","This game is great! If you've messed with any kind of assembly (I tinkered briefly with Core Wars and then gave up) it's very simple to pick up at least the first ten or so challenges, and I imagine even if you haven't it becomes pretty clear, the architecture is quite simple, but entertaining. Definitely has the fun of programming in a very limited environment!Also, linux support! Playing this on CENTOS 7.","What the hell am I doing with my life.","I am so old, I programmed computers when there was only machine code! This game is SO COOL!.  This really does remind me of the days when i got paid to do this stuff. Now I am a high end programmer that almost forgot the things i had to do to read a keyboard or display a single character on an ASCII display. Those were the days when everyone thought you were a genious for doing it.  Enough of the senile memories.  Love this game! If you don't know how computers work, get this game and you will see how things happen in a simple representative way. Then multiple what you learn by a billion or so to get the scale of modern systems.","Great mind warmer. I haven't felt this stupid in a while.After beating this you will feel like you made fire with two buckets of water.And you'll appreciate comparison operators. And any instruction you didn't have in this game.Programming languages are amazing.","Played this briefly and I can already tell this is going to be one of my favorite games. The in game assembly language is simple and can be picked up in minutes. That being said, It still could be useful in teaching some core concepts to people interested in assembly programming. I can already tell that the puzzles are going to haunt me with the thought of... \"How can I better optimize this.\".Worth the buy to for nerds.","10\/10 would assemble financial data with top secret government hardware again.","I need a life, this is more amusing to me than most modern high graphic games.. :(","If you like programming and\/or logic puzzles this game might be for you. True to the 70s computing theme, it's virtually all text. Bonus points for Linux support.","This is a game that I never knew I needed in my life until now.You code in a psuedo-type assembly language. If you are interested but the video\/coding language seems a bit scary, please don't be put off - the first two levels are introductory and will help you understand the basics of the language - just please print and read the manual that it gives you when you start the game.I'm hoping this game will inspire more programming related games and make programming seem fun as well as being educational. This is incredibly fun and challenging.","I consider this to be one of the best games about programming that i've ever seen.","T(h)is is a great idea! Simple, but a lot of fun!","Basically, you already know if you will like this game or not.  It is hardcore nerd logic fun with a dev assembly twist.I am enjoying it.","Ever programmed assembly language? You will *love* TIS-100. Yes, you will type CODE in this game. Easy code, but it's code nonetheless, like MOV and SWP and SAV and so on. Because you're trying to \"test\" this machine with bazillion little processors... by writing little programs in little CPUs, and the little CPUs have to talk to each other. Instead of rotating shapes and link atoms, you're moving numbers and popping registers and moving them through ports. And yes, this is intentionally looking like messing with the 80 column text days, And before you ask, yes, there's a meta game... you're trying to figure out the origin of this piece of hardware... by unlocking more bits of the little CPUs, dump the microcode, and solve the mystery... If you understand the concept of registers (and it's rather simple to visualize, but there's always a debugger to help you), then this game is a lot of fun. Though being Early Access, this doesn't have the solution site like SpaceChem but it's probably getting there soon. And this is VERY good exercise for people who intend to get into computer hardware engineering. Highly recommended... if you dig this genre.","A0dit0of0advice.0This0game0will0change0your0life0for0ever.0Enter0wiith0caut?","This is one of the nerdiest games I've played.I love it.","Saw Zachtronics.

It takes assembly programming and gives you fiendishly engrossing toy. Highly recommended!","\"Tesselatted Intelligence System\" is not your typical everyday computing system, dont buy this little gem thinking it will teach you programming, buy it because it WILL put you on the right track and show what a typical software debugger goes through in his job.     Its unbelievably \"simple\" and comes with a manual, it has its simplified programing language meaning to stress your brain and make it tuned to IF-THEN-OR-AND frequency required for programmers while at the same time challenging you to a cool puzzle and also having a story behind it all. Super tiny in size and super fun in content id recomend this on school computers in programing classes.    Finaly what catches my eye is the fact that this is considered Early Access meaning more content and polishing is planned.    All in all, money well spent. 10\/10","MOV ANY NILproblem solved","good game","I don't think Assembly gets enough credit. Sure, Assembly doesn't love you. Assembly isn't about love--Assembly is about thrills. Assembly hangs around in the bad part of town. Assembly knows all the gang signs. Assembly has a motorcycle, and wears the leathers everywhere, and never wears a helmet, because that would mess up Assembly's punked-out hair. Assembly likes to give cops the finger and grin and speed away. Mention that you'd like something, and Assembly will pretend to ignore you; the next day, Assembly will bring you one, no questions asked, and toss it to you with a you-know-you-want-me smirk that makes your heart race. Where did Assembly get it? \"It fell off a truck,\" Assembly says, putting away the boltcutters. You start to feel like Assembly doesn't know the meaning of \"private\" or \"protected\": what Assembly wants, Assembly takes. This excites you. Assembly knows how to get you anything but safety. Assembly will give you anything but commitment. In the end, you'll leave Assembly, not because you want something better, but because you can't handle the intensity. Assembly says \"I'm gonna live fast, die young, and leave a good-looking corpse,\" but you know that Assembly can never die, not so long as Assembly is still the fastest thing on the road.","If you enjoy any form of programming, you will probably love this. The language itself resembles Assembly, and is easy to pick up and hard to master. This is mostly due to the paralell processing nature of the \"TIS-100\", and the limited set of instructions that each node can store. The puzzles are cleverly made and offers a great challenge, you feel a little smarter after every level you complete.","I just love Zacktronics games, their recipie for Early Access is delightful, games already great, and they listen. Patchs rains on the bugs as soon as they come up, not even lying.The game itself can look completly obscure for the naked eye, but don't think this is only for programers. Like its predecesors, you try progressively harder challenges, discovering ways to do things by yourself along the way.Addictive, staying in your head even when you shut it down, TIS-100 is one more hit for intelligent-challenge seeking people. You will face different interfaces and types of objectives, some graphical, some mathematical, some logical, and even sandboxes.I hope a Steam workshop intergration comes around, as some variations in the game color scheme. But even right now, I would value the game more around 12 than 6. Get it !","So it's assembly.It's nicely simplified assembly.We're not really sure what the target audience is but we are in it and this is a wonderful logic game.","Excellent puzzle game. Even if you have no knowledge of programming, it's easy to pick up. If you HAVE some experience writing code, it becomes extra fun to optimize.Real sense of accomplishment as you start to complete harder tasks, and some of the operations get really challenging with the tools you have.Can't wait to see where this one goes.","A game with a very similar design to SpaceChem, except you are writing pseudo assembly language instead of abstractly moving chemicals around. Great fun!"],["This game is weirdly nostalgic.  I'm a software developer by tradeas are most everyone playing, most likelyand grew up with a Bell Labs CARDIAC cardboard computer.  It used you as the processor, with a small amount of \"memory\" (grid paper) a few \"registers\" (boxes on the card), and a tiny instruction set.  It had a booklet with problems to solve.That thing warped my brain to think and process problems the way a computer does, while LEGO provided the hands-on problem solving.  While a debatably cruel thing to do to a child, TIS-100 is the CARDIAC modernized.  These tools are engineer-makers.Now I can pass along the brain damage.  Thank you!","A fun game for people who understand or want to learn x86 or similar assembly.You're some guy named Randy in 1979 who stumbles accross a microcomputer and gets to work trying to understand the architecture. This game is all about assembly language and parralellism, so if that sounds fun you should check it out.You should print out the reference manual and keep it at your desk when playing this, otherwise you'll spend a long time trying to figure out simple things like why you can't address BAK.","Really interesting and extraordinary game.","Assembly optimization on a accumulator based parallel processor that lacks multiplication, what's not to like?","It takes a real genius to make a computer this retarded.","If you're capable of getting even slightly intrigued by what you've seen on this page, then you ought to get this game.There's also a lot to look forward to, in the final release -- esp. the community puzzles.","11\/10: would re-live traumatizing computer architecture curriculum again","Well, I'm having fun anyway.For people who enjoy programming, and exploring systems, this game can be a great challenge and a lot of fun. Since it posts a rudimentary sort of leaderboard, it can be competitive, too, as you try rewriting your solutions in various ways to achieve optimum performance or minimum number of instructions.Of course, you can probably achieve a similar thrill by finding and exploring a _real_ new\/unfamiliar system or coding language... but what the hell, I'm having fun, that's all that matters.I can't really imagine someone getting into this game who's not a programmer, or interested in programming. Because that's really what it is - programming in an extremely limited assembly language, while potentially dealing with parallelization issues (if you want to minimize your cycles... you don't have to if that particular optimization doesn't interest you).  You only get two registers, one of which only lets you swap it with the other, so if you need to use two variables at a time you end up using another node (CPU core?) just to read\/write the other value.So yeah, anyone with even a small amount of experience with an assembly langugae will find it easy to get into this game, but someone whose never played with assembly before will likely be lost.","This nice game.

If you loved SpaceChem and other Zachtronics games, this one won't let you down, and I would highly recommend!","I really like TIS-100.However, it feels more like the ASM exam back in college than an actual game. It's very enjoyable, but the developers should think of ways to make it more \"fun\" to play.Maybe the difficulty should be more varied. I don't find it that hard, but I would guess that the current difficulty might be overwhelming for ASM beginners.Two suggestions:- Add a \"BREAK\" instruction that would jumo to the top of the node. Adding an explicit label to the end (or top) of each node gets annoying quick.- If possible remove the \"ADD\" instruction (at least in further levels). AFAIK you should be able to do everything with SUB :D","This is like the water pipe game that you have to connect all the pipes and turn on the water and let it flow.I usually use X86 intel assembly, so this is a little too simple and somewhat backwards for me.

The manual is short (14 pages, some with only a few lines of text) but a little bit of a memorization grind until I went back and read things a couple times and really thought about the code examples they were showing. Major props for them making the \"manual\" a game artifact though, with the notes and highlighted portions - that actually really helped make it feel less like a chore.If you've never touched a line of code in your life, I'm not sure the manual alone is enough. Maybe?But for whatever reason I do enjoy this game a lot now that I've more or less memorized the minimal syntax and options. I've always enjoyed programming for the logic part of it, and this is kind of perfect in that I can do small little puzzles that slowly build on each other and then see how I stack up in efficiency. I could usually make things work in Java, but I love the feedback here on the elegance of the solution.","This is fanstically amazing and a must-have for those days you just feel like programming and getting absolutely nothing accomplished; it's like going to work, but fun.","You are not a programmer if you did not beat TIS-100 on lowest cycle count :)","Great puzzle game.

A few minutes later, I'm back in. My forehead is sore from frowning at one puzzle after another. So annoying! Highly recommended.","TIS-100 is an excellent puzzle game for those who enjoy tinkering with assembly language. As someone who's spent their fair share of time writing code for 6502, 6809, and 68000 based machines, I felt right at home playing this one. The TIS architecture is extremely barebones, making the game interesting even if you're a veteran of many other CPU platforms. Problem difficulty curves nicely, starting out with problems which introduce the architecture of the machine and ramping up from there to some rather tricky puzzles. In addtion to the gameplay, the little bits of story and 80s esque manual are a nice touch to the rather barebones presentation. My only gripe is that the game locks up occasionally. I own a Mac, and do not know whether or not the game does this on other platforms. If you like puzzles and retrocomputing, this is definitely one to pick up!","S:MOV UP ACC","Still a great game after 2 years.If you ever wanted to know what it was like programming a digital signal processor (wihout having to worry about the gory details), this game will give you a taste.  I have programmed everything from the 6502 to the 56k and 68k at the machine code level (and loved the Motorola reference in the game plot) and this game, while a great abstraction of many details (it really wouldn't be a fun game without doing this), captures the deeply fun part of programming.Nice Job Zachtronics.","If you enjoy logic puzzle games and number games, this game is probably for you!Read the fine manual, wait for it to self test to finish on the TIS-100.It is time to set down and fix some of these corrupt subroutines.Figuring out how to solve implementing different levels of higher logic out of the basic rules of:add(this to the accumulator)sub(this from the accumulator)mov this, to thatand some conditional jumps.The ability to store the accumulator into a temporary register.Last but not least the ability to negate a number.Oh and the ability to do nothing, yes doing nothing sometimes is a productive choice. (NOP)The subtle e-sport of data movement and modification.The most fun part of the game is checking out to see how others are doing when it comes to solving the problems.Some people take extra time to optimize for execution time, instruction count, and node usage. You also get 3 slots to have unique solutions to each of the segments that need to be solved and optimized.Working is good, optimized is always better!Pros:Cheaper than a development board.Better debuger tools then most development boards.No images to flash or put on sd cards.A good way to streatch your creativity bone when it comes to dreaming up solutions.You can accidently learn about execution pipeliningA good way to kill some time and tune your mind for puzzle solving.","Assembly is ! How did anyone ever use it?","I managed to finish most of the puzzles in a few hours, but I'm an experienced programmer. I suppose it's in early access so more puzzles should be coming later.Some of the remaining puzzles are pretty hard, and I didn't feel inclined to solve them because: There is no space to write any comments.  There should be space on every single line to write a comment.  I'd walk away to get something to eat and come back and it would take a while to remember what I was trying to do.Just trying to swap 2 numbers to solve e.g. the sorting puzzle is next to impossible because of the very limited instruction set.  An insert sort can be done in 3 lines of C code, but forget trying to do an insert sort on a TIS-100.The multiple CPUs running in parallel is interesting although you only ever get to use 12 at most.  Most of those 12 will be running idle though because in many cases you will be using them merely as memory storage, since there are no OP codes to access RAM.  So in the end you only ever write 1 or maybe 2 threaded programs that can only use a couple of variables,  There are real computers out there with a similar architecture to the TIS-100 (e.g. Adapteva Epiphany) and solving the given puzzles on one of those would be a lot easier, and you'd be learning a real computer instead of a fake one.","Honestly, you should know already whether you want to play a game about writing code to pass unit tests in a minimalist (but not strictly minimal*) assembly language for a stream processing architecture with no physical implementation or professional utility. Therefore, I will primarily address the few remaining issues.Yes, it is implemented well. Yes, the puzzles are chosen well across a good range of difficulty. No, the developer is not running a scam or otherwise objectionable.* Specifically, it does have more jump instructions than strictly necessary, both subtraction and negation, and some pseudoports. These improve the optimization possibilities drastically and the \"power\" of the language quite slightly. It also has comments, labels, and human-readable names for instructions and ports because it's an exercise in cleverness, not cruelty.Accessibility: The game has no time pressure ever. The interface uses both the keyboard and a pointer. The interface doesn't require great precision with the pointer, but it does require entering a fair bit of text. There are no vital sound-only cues. No lines are voiced; all dialogue is presented in text. Only the puzzles involving the graphics module rely solely on color for identification; specfically, there's a single shade of red in addition to white, black, and two greys. It's visible in one of the screenshots on the store page. As a non-expert, I see only minor problems except for the blind, who could only possibly play with both an OCR-capable screenreader and immense patience.","Good old Zachtronics.One more game to build a working machine.

Bonus for a quality early access game!","MOV LIKE,ACCADD REVIEWMOV ACC,STEAM","If you like SpaceChem and\/or Infinifactory and always secretly wished Zach would just drop the abstraction so you can get to the core programming challenge, well, here you go. Repeat after me, \"SWP, SAV, SUB LEFT, JLZ\"...","This is a fantastic game. It's obviously inpired by programming for old processors like the Z-80. But there are a few things that make this something very different than a Z-80 simulator.1. The instruction set is *very* limited, mainly because there's no numeric \"representation\". So no rotates or shifts; no bitwise instructions. It's all just adding and subtracting integers.2. There are just two registers that you can store values in -- and one of these you can only access indirectly. Not a lot to keep track of.3. The machine consists of multiple processors that send numbers to each other in a very simple way. So a lot of the problems are ways of making numbers flow around. I feel like I'm only starting to grasp how this can be exploited to solve the problems.My only complaint about the game is that I'd like to be able to see some kind of global leaderboards or metrics, so I'd know if my solutions were decent. The leaderboards in the game apparently include Steam friends, but if you don't have a lot of friends that are into this kind of thing, it's kind of lonely ;).","I'll keep this short and sweet. This game delivers on the thrill of figuring things out. Not necessarily the solving of a puzzle - more primal even than that. It's the joy of gaining clarity in a situation that at first seems daunting and esoteric. The delight of elucidating a problem to which you had no foothold previously.If you have never attempted to learn low-level programing before, this game will frustrate you at first. But that doesn't mean it's not worth it. Little by little, you will start to get it. And that thrill, the sudden jolt whenever your mind finally wraps itself around an element of the game, is delightfully spooky.","This is the game I never knew I wanted.  If you like programming efficiently, this is the game for you.","TIS-100 is a puzzle game where you are tasked with programming small artificial algorithms, like coding interview puzzles (find the biggest number in a sequence of inputs). The trick here is that you have to write your solution in an extremely constrained assembly language (just a handful of instructions) and with only one general purpose register. Oh and code blocks can only be 10 instructions long. There are SO many constraints, you will basically have to create Rube Goldberg machines to win. You have to MacGuyver your way to success every time. The ONLY solution is an ugly hack, and the optimal solution is probably a REALLY ugly hack. When you reach a solution, you will feel smart. Hell let's face it, if you can do it you ARE smart. If you're not, solve them with a friend maybe.The challenge of this game starts out easy, but by about the ninth or tenth puzzle (out of about 20 currently) I was seriously stumped. Luckily you can skip a level and come back to it!I've written in assembly for microcontrollers and x86, both in college and for work. This game will not teach you any employable skill and is not a teaching tool. It is not representative of any real-world computer as far as I am aware, but it will appeal to the same type of people that would probably want to learn the history of sorting algorithms so they can find one to use in TIS-100. So maybe in that regard it will motivate you to learn. Or reinvent a very tiny wheel at least.","What's more fun than assembly? Assembly with a tiny instruction set, no memory, and running on parallel execution nodes of course!Although it seems intimidating at first, the lack of flexibility actually funnels you through solutions fairly elegantly, and it's not as terrifying as it looks. It also looks great on your resume for that Atari 2600 job you always wanted.","Super Nerdy Fun","This is not a game for the light-hearted. Prepare to be (enjoyably) pulling your hair out trying to understand how the \"system\" operates while working back and forth with the provided REFERENCE MANUAL to understand the intentionally verbose and vague instructions. However! That's what makes this game so much fun. Imagine you've been left alone in a darkened room with this strange and mysterious machine and YOU ALONE have to understand how it works and operates. A Pandora's box of sorts. You want to learn how it works and continue to finish the provided protocols, but you're secretly afraid of what's going to happen once you complete them all.In my opinion it could use a bit more of a tutorial, but the provided materials give a great starting point for the first few programs you're asked to code. If you've enjoyed SpaceChem and\/or Infinifactory you'll most definitely love TIS-100. As always, the enjoyment comes from when you FINALLY get your system it to work after hours of coding only to find some other person has done it 200 cycles quicker. Who is that guy\/girl? Why are they always smarter than me?","This little puzzle game is absolutely _evil_.  I _love it_.Perhaps I'm biased, as I'm a software developer IRL, but the very difference in the type of logic needed for this programming as compared to \"real\" programming with current languages has made this something of a treat.  Ironically, I've spent considerable time on some of these puzzles trying to squeeze every last cycle out of the solution, when for my job, it's the sort of thing I'd ignore and consider generally unimportant (speed of development generally taking a higher priority).  Getting to poke and puzzle in this little crippled multi-processor assembly-code environment is quite a treat.  Greatly enjoying it.That said, if you don't have some minimal grounding in general programming concepts and assembly language in general, you'll likely experience a significant uphill slog at first to get used to it - though even coming from a development background, there's a lot of unlearning to do. :)"],["I don't write reviews often but when I do, they're probably extremely mediocre and probably don't contain anything someone else hasn't already said.Anyway, if you're a programmer or puzzle solver this is a game definitely worth the money.It'll make you think fairly hard especially with the later levels\/problems.

This game has provided a fun look at some of the logic needed for it and is an overall fun puzzle game for those not technically inclined. whether you are a programmer or not, this game offers a multitude of challenges that can seem trivial at the start but can expand into something much more difficult when looking for optimizations. This game is not for everyone, however. It is meant more towards the programmers, but can be enjoyed by everyone.

It is rather short, can be completed in a few days with a few hours each, but to optimize the programs a lot of time can be spend, especially if you are competing with your friends.","TIS-100 is an awesome puzzle game for those who really love programming.It's more than just programming, as you could solve most of the puzzles fairly easily in a modern programming environment, but rather is about learning a way of solving code problems with tight limits on memory storage spaces, how to interact between multiple independent \"nodes\", and a finite number of lines of code per each node.Also, you can see the best cycle counts, lines of code, and nodes used for yourself and your Steam friends, which gives it some competitive aspects as well. This is also possible because there are so many different ways to solve each puzzle!","Make learning about assembly interesting: play this game!","So, you want to show off your skills in programming but lack the basic knowlage of any language at all? Well where better to start than at the beginning of all computer languages, and a simplified version at that.TIS-100 has you going through a series of puzzles trying to return this ancient computer to its former glory, all of these puzzles may seem simple at first, and they in fact are quite simple. However, what could be completed in a few lines of python or C will now take 12 processing nodes and up 192 lines of code, it definetly breaks you out of your comfort zone and into thinking outside the box.

Not because I didn't know, but because the immense nature of learning ASM to play a video game strikes me as, well, \"holy crap what have I done\".Cutting to the chase, you're actually programming sequenced data.  Think of it like messing with a virtual machine (which lives inside of a C# meta-virtual machine).  You're writing ASM.  Wanted to learn? This isn't the ASM you know or want to know, but if you want to learn about fun stuff which is at least adjacent to code, this is a great game.","This is my kind of game. I love how I can learn the principles of assembly at the same time as I'm having fun playing an interactive puzzle game. It was my favoruite game before I started playing it.","Buy it.","This is an instant classic!Amazing!It feels like I can't begin to thank the people behind this game enough!Sure it's a bit of a niche game (programming assembler in a special fashion) but it feels really good.I do program in asm normally to, but right now mostly in C, but this like I said, feels very good and fun. :-)","Love this game!!!!!!","Another fun game from the minds behind SpaceChem. Brings back all of those horrible memories of learning to write assembly code. It is early access, but the game is already a blast to play. If there ever was a game concept that deserves to be called a puzzle game - it's this.  Play it. It's fun, and it beats doing 'real' work.","I love this game and if you love programming you probably will too. The TIS-100 has a very simple instruction set and an architecture that is focused on concurrency. The programming tasks are mostly straightforward, but will have you thinking about how to exploit the architecture. The manual, in game text, and overall aesthetic really add to the experience. A great programming puzzle game.Even more puzzles now.","A lovely little programming game, and I must say, the shutdown effect when you close the program is lovely.","A great game for anyone who knows some assembly programming or wants to get started learning assembly, TIS-100 is a game about creating systems of small pieces of code to perform a task, such as multiplying a number or counting the length of a sequence.The TIS-100 system is very different from any real CPU, only supporting 13 instructions (including conditional jumps). One TIS-100 program includes code for each different \"node\" within the system. Regular processing nodes can pass data between them using registers, and each node has just two internal registers not used for passing values. There are also memory nodes wchich store data in a stack.The format of numbers within the TIS-100 is very strange: values are from -999 to 999, which must require at least 12 bits but wastes one bit. It is impossible to do bitwise operations on these values. Additionally, there is no support for input or output of text characters within programs, but the OS does this somehow."],["Zachtronics mission statement seems to read:1: Convince players that they missed their calling as code monkeys.2: Provide games that are well disguised time machines, allowing players to lose an hour without noticing.3: Ensure that the game makes players think so hard and so abstractly, that their brains physically hurt. You gotta hand it to them, theyre living up to that mission statement and then some. TIS-100 is another *superb* offering from Zachtronics. Its streamlined, minimal, abstract and scratches that itch that only optimizing algorithms can scratch.

Its an extremely enjoyable experience. One thing that would be nice is for people to add-on components to the game, like different functions, syntax, etc, and\/or add-on levels designed by other users, then voted on, kinda of like the multi-player levels in Starcraft, that way the game would be ever expanding. Maybe implement Steam Workshop for adding RAM, encryption, more advanced machine, more accurate assembly language modules, etc. This game is fun as it is, but it has an amazing potential, that would be great sequels, or even dlc. Absolutely a must purchase.After Release: Even better. Now you can compare results with friends, there is another addition, which I believe is sharing of net files, idk, haven't compeleted enough levels yet. Secret level works great, and fun to do. Achievements, are good, and give you hints on whats better, or high scores, or secrets. Plus, it now checks your code with 3 random passes, and its nearly impossible to cheat a level now, so that's good. The scores you see, are pretty legitamate.","This game is great until any of your friends beat your score and you spend the next several hours wondering where the !@#$ they cut 3 cycles from, and how are you going to cut at least 4.","As with all Zachtronics products this one is a serious brain burner.Fantastic sense of achievement when you manage to sort your logic out.Great sense of authenticity in the basic presentation.Pure puzzle fun!Highly recommended even in this early access state.","Zachtronics, I love you.I'm going to have to take a vacation from work so I have more time to play this game.","Having taken x86 assembly and finishing with a poor grasp of the concepts, I didn't think I would enjoy this game at all.

Even though the game is still in Early Access, I can already see its potential in a simple dev board\/kit kind of deal... Moving data in a spacial manner (left,down instead of core no. n) is IMO a very smart way of managing parallel data across many cores.TIS-100 is a great teaching aid in the pitfalls of multithreaded programming.. You know a race condition and a deadlock when you see one.Seriously, a TIS-style chip on the market could simplify many of the problems electronics hobbyists face...Although i'm already a programmer (and have done Assembly in the past), the language quickly sinks in.

This game is sort of like SpaceChem in a programming-like wrapper.  To be clear, though, for those programmers out there: this game is a puzzle game first and an assembly language simulator second. Many features you might expect from an assembly language are absent here. That's not a bad thing, however. This makes the game more approachable for those who haven't programmed in assembly, or are relatively new to programming in general. I'd imagine that even non-programmers could figure this out without much trouble if they come at it with the same mindset as SpaceChem. Those who have some experience in assembly should feel right at home. Like SpaceChem, this game encourages an almost obsessive drive to optimize to reduce cycle counts, part usages, etc. The manual that is included (and that it suggests you print out) is probably the nerdiest thing ever, and I love it! It reminds me of some manuals like the Apple 1 and 6502 manuals from the 70s-80s. The manual is quite a bit sparse, though, with several pages left almost completely blank except for a brief header. I'm not sure if these are pages are left to take notes on or if they're going to be filled out more as the game leaves early-access. There are also far fewer puzzles than SpaceChem at the time of writing. There are tools for users to create their own puzzles, but I hope that more puzzles are added as the game develops. If you like SpaceChem, or techy puzzle games at all, this $7 game is well worth the price.","Like puzzles? Like coding in an assembly-like language? Like the idea of clustered computing? Then this game is for you!This game really reminds me of learning MIPS\/SPIM in college. Except this is much harder (only ONE (well... two) registers!) and multiple cores with their own execution plans, and data passed between them. This is a good example of making complex systems out of very simple building blocks. A great way to work your brain!","Puzzles are in the form of pipelining\/synchronization problems. You'll write in a limited form of a assembly, within a limited amount of lines of code. It's a lot more fun than it sounds, but probably only if you have done some programming before.  I'd say if you know you want to play it, then you're probably right. If you are just intrigued, probably not.","While people who have written assembly code will have an advantage, don't let that stop you if you haven't.

I was then called lazy and insulted numerously about basically how much of a prick and how lazy I am.So I tried this game, I was met with tough puzzles, but the \"Coding\" if any is really just moving numbers around accumulators and it's got a really nice classic view for the computer, with interesting little debug stories about the machine you're working on.It really just needs the steam workshop so players can make their own and have a good bit of fun with it.9\/10, would \"Mov Left, Right\" again.","I will tell you one thing.

For that reason alone I was willing to buy TIS-100 sight unseen. I have to say that once again I am not disappointed by a Zachtronics game.No programming skill is needed to play, but you will need to reference the manual quite a bit for the first few puzzles. Like most of the reviewers here, I would highly recommend printing out the manual rather than referencing the pdf constantly. You will find yourself learning the commands by the second or third puzzle anyway. From then on solving the puzzles really boils down to how much time you are willing to commit to making the \"wrong output\" beeps go away.TIS-100 is not always easy, but if you are willing to commit a little time and brainpower it is very rewarding to watch your program complete its cycles perfectly.

I'm assuming there might be puzzles that require you to make a picture or simple graphics of some kind.  There is also a manual that comes with the game that they recommend you have open while playing that contains the different commands to run.

This game consists of a series of specifications and tests that your code must pass.  In the beginning, the code mostly involves dealing with sequences and basic arithmetic using the basic node (which has 2 registers and can hold 15 lines of code).  Later puzzles involves the stack node.  Other nodes can push and pop from the stack by writing and reading.  After that you deal with the visualization puzzles, where one specific output is wired to a 30x18 display.Whenever you complete a task, your ranking (given in lines of code, number of nodes used, and number of cycles used) is displayed along with a histogram of other users.  If you need more of a challenge, you can try to optimize your code.It's a great \"game\".","*Disclaimer- only played 1 hour so far, if my opinion changes I will edit this review*Could be good but still needs work, IMO.

In-game tells you nothing.-Feels more like a tech-demo than a game-Could be so much more","That moment when you realize that you can further reduce one more line of code!10\/10","helps you to find out how much of a nerd you really are.a challenging abstract puzzle, where logic is your only friend.the first steps are quite confusing. understanding the concept might be a small challenge, but once you got into it: you're addicted. \"hello world\"\/10","An incredibly fun game, if programming a group of up to 12 nodes that each only has two registers is your cup of tea.  It sure is mine.  As a straight up warning, if logic puzzles aren't your thing, this game will be a drag for you.  You will need to read the manual.  There's no tutorial, and there is no in-game help.   Knowledge of actual assembler is helpful, but not required.  The ability to think logically and enjoy stepping through your program to see exactly what it's doing are requirements, however.For each challenge, you are given your problem statement: take in data in this format, perform this operation, output this result.  You are given sample input data, and the expected output you would need to provide.  When you feel your program is ready, you run it, it's given the sample input data, and the output is checked against the expected.  If your program produces correct output, you pass -- if it produces incorrect output, the discrepancies are noted and you'll have to fix your program.The challenge comes from the fact that the computer ostensibly running your program is laughably limited: 12 nodes, each of which has 2 registers (ACC and BAK) and can only contain 15 lines of code.  Op codes are exceedingly primitive as well: you only get 13 (no operation, move data, swap data, save data, add, subtract, negate, jump, jump if equal to zero, jump if greater than zero, jump if less than zero, and jump a number of lines).  At the higher levels, synchronizing communication between the nodes becomes an additional difficulty. If the idea of implementing multiplication within these limitations intrigues you, you just might like this game.Finally, your program is graded on three criteria: number of nodes used, number of instructions used, and number of cycles used.  When it completes successfully, you'll be compared against the aggregate of those before you, which means even after you complete a problem successfully, you can be inspired to figure out smaller, faster ways of doing the task.There's a minor backstory that's given in the flavor of the manual, and with most of the puzzles, but it's very small.","Press MOV UP ACC; JEZ END to pay respects.","This Game teaches you, with little to no Handholding the Basics of Programming with logical Puzzles.It is a lot of fun, and I challenge myself to not look up a solution on the internet, until I solved it myself, and go to find Tricks by people who code more efficient and slim than me.It is a Brainteaser and my first Game from this company (the others of them are now on my wishlist).I higly recomend this for anyone who likes Hacking Games like Uplink, Puzzle games, old Computers and related stuff (movies like wargames and so on) and who is not afraid to read a manual instead of an tutorial.Great Game all around!MOV GAM SUCCESS","Really good game if you like puzzle\/problem solving.

I cant recommend it as to the fact that it could have been so much more.Dont get me wrong, the game is fun. It shows how much fun you can actually have with numbers and how interesting computer science (coding) can actually be. But it reaches its limits on what it can do way too quickly, leaving you with only the thought of what could have been possible.And what also needs to be said, is the lack of any kind of tutorial. Sure the game tries to introduce you to its mechanics by starting with very simple levels, tho having to open a pdf to read through pages of (for most people) irritating stuff might not appeal to everyone.So what is TIS-100? Well it is basically the same as programming tho it extremely restricts you by either limiting the amount of commands you have at your disposal or limiting the amount of lines you can write per module.Having to shorten your label names just so you can write them in the same line as another command should not have been a design choice and should not be something you will need to do. It can be extremely frustrating when your solution takes one more line of code than the module can take, making the game simply not accept your solution. For me, the biggest flaw this game has.Now maybe some or a lot of people will disagree with me not to recommend this game, but to the person considering to buy it:You appear interested in the game as you read this negative review and the fact that you are still reading is enough for me to say: just buy it.You will have fun and enjoy the game but if youre looking for more i can honestly only recommend programming...EDIT after 3 years:I now no longer in any way recommend this game. If you are thinking about picking this up, go grab \"exapunks\" instead (same developer). It is exactly what tis-100 tries to be and is everything it could have been, maybe even more. Go check exapunks out, you won`t regret it!PS: If you were wondering: yes, programming will need some more time to get into, but as described here, it yields so much more possibilities. This game is a good start to see if you are interested in such logical thinking. If you really are, who knows, maybe taking that extra step and writing your first own programs will be worth it.PSS: If youre looking for some tasks (basically what the game gives you at the start of each level) i can give you some pretty interesting ones, some of which are actually pretty hard to think through. Those lessons will get you into programming (and into some deeper stuff if youre a non beginner). Just message me that youre interested and we work out the details.This offer only counts for Java.","Even though I haven't logged enough hours for this review to be considered a worthwhile review (under 20 hours)...This game is everything that should be within a hacking\/coding game.The onslaught of errors, the restless finger-numbing excitement, the constant checking and re-checking the manual...

There is a big cluster of processors and you need to write a programm to fullfill tasks, where instructions, cycles and nodes count in the scoreboard. You need to write the programs in assembler for TIS-100, which is a machine using a very small instruction set and only two registers, ACC and BAK. You can use special registers for the ports (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) and pseudo-ports (ANY, LAST) to talk with other processors.","Ok just a FYI Some people are artists, some are murdurers of canvas. In a simular vein, some people can code, and some can't. It is a fact. It has nothing to do with smarts. It just has to do with how someones brain is wired and the way it goes about solving a problem.With that in mind..... If you are one of those who can get through a basic programming class or two without scratching your head figuring out what a variable is and you enjoyed that programming then this game may be for you. It is a fun little program that runs you through several challenges that verry quickly increase in difficulty. Your purpose is generally to take a input and perform some sort of function or a series of functions upon it so you can find a output. The catch is you have a limited amount of space to write code. you can only store 1 or two varriables at a time, and moving varriables is verry limited. The ultimate purpose is to reach the output with the least amount of cycles (or turns), code, and nodes. If that is something you enjoy then come play with us nerds.TL;DRIf you like strange logic puzzles or if you love programming weird algorithms, buy it. Its cheap","This is hard to recommend, but I'll do it anyways.GlossarGeneralAbout the gameStill not sure?The VerdictGeneralHere's a warning: if you're bad with logic, or are not interested in learning really abstract logics, or do not have the will and\/or brains to think about solutions for a while, you're gonna have a bad time. If however you are interested in learning new things and tackling challenges, go ahead.I'm not sure if I can recommend it to anyone who's not interested in programming though. But if you are, and are even remotely interested in a really nerdy game (not some pseudo-hacking like Uplink, which is a great game), pick this up, you won't regret it.About the gameThis game is about programming. Forget your HTML and Unity, this here is ASM, better known as assembler or machine code. Well, sort of.The game begins with telling you to read the manual, which you should, even when you already know ASM. The game has some specific rules bound to the machine it's simulating. So you take 20min and read the manual, and after that you go through the panels in the game one by one and figure out solutions.It's built like a puzzle game. You get certain tasks, you need to program the solution with the limited resources you're provided with. To ensure the solution is correct it's got a lot of test cases for every task. Only when all test cases succeed it's considered a success. Just your everyday programming stuff.Still not sure?The tasks start relatively easy, but pick up the difficulty quite quickly.Here's an easy one:You have two inputs and two outputs. Send Input A - Input B to Output A; send Input B - Input A to Output B. You move some values around, you subtract, no big deal, easy fun times.Here's a little more difficult one:You have one input and one output. A series of values is sent through the input. Whenever the current value is at least 10 away from the previous value, send 1 to output, else send 0 to output. This one took me a while, but I felt like a boss when I got it. I dare to say most people who are not into programming will never find the solution.You have multiple nodes for developing solutions, each node can contain 15 lines of ASM instructions, each node has two places for memory. You can move values through the registers, you can set jump points, you can react if a value is less than 0, equals 0, or is greater than 0, you can negate values. That's about it.By now you should know if this game is for you.The VerdictI'm a programmer myself, but on high level languages. I've taken a look at ASM before, but when you don't implement it a couple of times you'll just have trouble imagening what it could be used for, and how. This game gives you plenty of examples. I have tons of fun with it, even though I just stare at the screen and think for 10min at times. This game is something else, you won't find this very often. I'm very glad it exists, because it teaches me a few things.","Damn.","Ever want to know what the fuss is with being a CompSci person or a programmer? Want to feel like you don't know what the problem is and when you find the solution you don't know how you got it? This game is a 90% accurate representation of what it's like programming. It may be assembly, which makes it even harder, but this is what it's like on almost all occasions of programming something. You messed the code up and now you have to find the line that's messed up. In all honesty, this is a great game to feel like a nervous wreck in the world of development! [results may vary]","Some of the most entertainment I've ever had for 5. The learning curve does have a little bit of a sharp turn on node 6, but it does continue to build on what you've learned before that and introduce more complexity as the game continues. The language is wonderfully simple, containing only the most basic of required assembly instructions. The limited program space in each processor contributes significantly to the difficulty of more complex programs, requiring the use of multiple processors to implement an algorithm and thus encouraging the use or parallel processing for increased speed. The display of statistics relative to other players after each successful run really inspired me to revisit completed nodes to improve efficiency, either of processor cycles or total instructions - definitely encouraging the traditional hacking mindset! Definitely recommend to anyone who likes logic puzzles, and especially to programmers or aspiring programmers.","This game is lots of fun IF you have any knowledge of assembly. Otherwise you may have a rough time.","turbonerds only need apply","Great game for anyone interested in low level code. Although not a realistic assembly implementation, it does challenge you like any RISC system. Would love it if some bitwise operations (shifts and logical) were added (even if only in a new section) since these are common even in RISC and would greatly reduce the cycle count of trivial programs like the averaging of two numbers program.","A pretty fun puzzle game, as long as your idea of fun involves writing assembly code!","Skynet is tricking us to program terminater using this game.","The programming game you always wanted.10\/10","Once finished, will add the \"100_PERCENT_V2\" achievement line on my Curriculum Vitae.10\/10","This game is like your job, only you know what you're supposed to do, and it's fun.","Very nice concept if u love programming u gonna enjoy it","Really fun puzzler.

It's especialy awesome if you ever owned an old school Tandy, Apple II, or the like and programmed on those.  I've been nostalgicly addicted!  It's well worth the extremely reasonable price!Just a note, the game absolutely requires that you have quick access to the manual as a coding reference.

If you've done any assembly then you can pick up the architecture and instruction set real fast by reading the manual.TIS-100 is also good for people with low vision because it's compatible with Windows Magnifier! This, all by itself, makes it better than most \"hacking\" games out there in my book. I'd like to play the \"Hacker Evolution\" series but I can't because of this issue.But is the TIS-100 a good way for somebody with no prior background to get their first taste of programming?

You get a real attachment to the computing units you come up with in this game, and I am only half-kidding when I say that ... This is probably the game I have had most fun with this year, but it is obviously an acquired taste. I am interested in programming on a hobby basis, but have zero experience with low level programming, so maybe that is way the game struck a chord with me. I would guess that the game is slightly less satisfying if you are a computer scientist who has solved these kind of problems in assembly before, but for me the challenge level has been almost perfect.

You don't need programming expirence if you are decent at logic puzzles and learning new things. Mostly you just need the dedication to read the retro styled computer manual and mess around until you have an idea of what's going on. All the negative reviews boil down to \"It's too hard and there's no turorial\".This game is absolutely a challenge. I'd say definitely don't look up tutorials, hints, or solutions. It may be easier, but not doing so will make success that much sweeter.","Assembly ACM-ICPC.AC","As a programming puzzle game this is absolutely fantastic. The debugger is quite useful and the limited architecture can make even simple tasks complex, which suits a puzzle game just fine. It also forces you to think in parallel if you want to get the best cycle times. Sometimes you can make a change that you think should improve times significantly only to see them go up because of a bottleneck you didn't notice. Sometimes you'll just be optimizing for size and stumble on something that speeds it up as well. As far as the arch goes for real world applications, it does leave some stuff to be desired, there's several very simple tweaks that could be done to make things more efficient without adding much more silicon. However, since it's a game and not meant to be used for serious tasks, that's OK. Hopefully the experience with this will help teach people how they could use chips like the GA144 and various Tilera processors, if they are ever so inclined.","Great game about basic computing.With an evil twist of harsh memory limits and parallel processing.Can't wait for the Free to play version.With pay per additional line of instruction memory or additional registers for premium members.","A friend asked me if this was \"My job: the game\" and I have to say, no.

Also, people who have no interest in programming are unlikely to find this puzzle game interesting.

This game is taking my life over.It started off with curiosity, turned into confusion and now into an obsession. I've gone to bed trying to work solutions out in my head.If you've played SpaceChem you can grasp how difficult(but simple) this game can be. There's no single way to solve a puzzle, though you're compared to everyone else that plays the game, so you might realize your code isn't as efficient as other people's and it may make the obsession greater.In terms of gameplay, it's just a basic coding with a proprietary language. You are given objectives and need to manipulate inputs to achieve a proper output. The game does not hold your hand at all. Don't get frustrated though, it's got a learning curve, but it's worth doing.The game comes with a PDF of a reference manual, if you've ever done any coding with proprietary languages, you've seen these. It's a neat little booklet that gives you all the commands and what they do. If you've never done any kind of programming, this will also seem pretty intense.Print it out and keep it on your lap until you know how every function works.Storywise: It's there, I'm not far enough to go into too much detail, but your uncle picked this weird computer up at a swap meet and he's been tinkering with it trying to figure out how it works. He ends up dying and the reference manual ends up in your lap and you begin messing with it.On the manual itself there's little notes and scribbles from your uncle as he was trying to figure it out, and there's some flavor text if you read it all.In the game itself the stories are 'hidden' in corrupted cores of the program itself. You click \"DEBUG\" on these, and you'll see a journal entry from your uncle that gives some idea as to what's going on.This game is a definite buy. Just stick with it, it's challenging but it's incredibly rewarding once you figure out how to solve the puzzle.If you've ever been interested in learning how to program, this won't teach you anything immediately applicable. But it will put you into a decent mindset of how you have to think to write programs.Either way, buy it.EDIT: It's 3:30 in the morning, the last time i looked it was just after midnight. I just thought uncle Randy was neurotic and obsessive, but no there's something here....something calling to me....I need to sleep but I'm sure I can figure out what this machine is for, I seem to have accidentally tampered with the machine in some way, the instructions are scrambled...but I'm sure I've almost solved it....I'm so close....sleep laterJust one more line of code","Everything about this game seems wrong.  There's no tutorial at all, just a 14-page manual that isn't very clear or explanatory.  You get dumped into a screen with bunch of options that pretty much mean nothing to you at that point, you have to enter your programming commands with text rather than clicking buttons or dragging components or anything.  Did you know you can hit escape to get a menu screen?  Well, it's not like the game tells you that or has a button to click that does that.  This game seems like it pretty much goes out of its way to be abusive.  And while the programming isn't exactly like writing assembly language in the real world, it's pretty close.  The main difference being that you only have one register and a vastly reduced set of commands to work with, but at least they give you up to 12 of these semi-worthless processors to cluster together...There's a reason that most programmers don't code in assembly language - heck, most programmers don't even learn assembly these days.  That's because it's annoying and is a huge time sink.  So, Zachtronics made an abusive, poorly-explained, drab-looking game about it.  And it's fricking amazing.

Assembler is a different world even for the experienced of us. It brings the nostalgic feeling of what kind of issues people had to tackle in the early days of computers. It has not too many commands to be difficult to remember, so it should be easy-ish game to approach even for beginners. In the end the biggest part of the puzzle is thinking of the big picture, how the numbers should move, what are the logics to make programs work.

I've blown through the first few segments, but I foresee some serious fun squeezing every last cycle out of my solutions.  I'm thoroughly looking forward to the \"rest of the story,\" although the main fun for me has been solving the puzzles and meta-puzzles.The game really captures the feel of being a hacker in the 80's, before an ill-informed media turned \"hacker\" into a dirty word.  The \"government conspiracy\" aspect of the story is fun, and plays into that university-student-hacker feel as well.  I feel a bit like a naive kid again as I read Uncle Randy's notes.And it is NOT just a game.  The TIS-100 emulator is a perfect sandbox for exposing the basics of parallel processing.  I'm using the game to teach my 13 yr. old how to think like a programmer.  Working on the game is required homework, but the fun-factor is keeping it from being \"more boring schoolwork.\"  I seriously believe that this game would be a great extra-credit activity for any 8 thru 12 grade coding course.  And would certainly give any programming major a big clue about what's under the hood of their system(s).One note: the Steam discussion for this game seems to have a lot of spoilers, so don't go looking until you've solved everything!  I am looking forward to joining the discussion, but not just yet.  ':)>","Really awesome and challenging game, As a programmer I found it to be innovative and interesting, but also challenging and fun.  It is much like programming in real assembly language, but more simplified and somwhat modularized to allow people unfamiliar with assembly programming to get the hang of it.  I would definately love to see more games like this as i feel it can really peak an interest in any aspiring programmers and build a solid foundation for real world applications.  I would like to reiterate, it is a segnificantly dumbed down form of assembly language, but I feel this game does have some very strong educational roots and can help players develop a foundation for programming.  The game itself has a steep learning curve but provides an incredibly fun and unique challenge to the player, requiring lots of logical thinking.  I also like that the game does not have a 1 puzzle 1 solution model, it looks for the right answer not the right way to acheive the answer, witch is fundimental in real world programming.  There is no one true way to accomplish anything when programming and I beleive this game really does a good job of playing on that aspect.  Overall I want to say this game is worth more than its price tag, especially if your into programming or logical challenges.  at times some puzzles can become stressful when you cant figure out how to solve one, but the game allows you to select from multiple avalible puzzles, preventing you from being hung up on a single puzzle and not being bale to progress.","Limited instruction set but fun","The best assembler programming game that never anyone asked for.The puzzles are amazing - I love it!","One of the first puzzle games that's actually pulled me back in even after completing it to optimize my solutions.The experience of doubling the efficiency of my code with one line is a joy in and of itself.","TIS-100 is a game unlike any other I've played. For one, it actually requires you to think. This is not a game where you can just jump right in and make a program right away. With the exception of the first program, you have to make all the programs from scratch. Secondly, it actually feels like you are writing actual programs. Yes, the program language may be made up, but, to \"debug\" the puzzles, you need to use the same exact skills needed to write real-life programs, such as troubleshooting, program organization, and critical thinking, just to name a few. And to add to the feel, there is no tutorial. There is only an owner's manual on pdf. All of this added together really makes you feel like a genius after you solve a puz - uh, I mean - debug a program.All in all, if you are looking for a game that is fast-paced and action-packed, go look somewhere else. But, if you like to think through a puzzle that makes you feel good about yourself afterwards, or if you are ever interested in programming at all and would like a taste of what it takes, then this game is PERFECT for you.","TL;DR: 4\/5 - Give it a try, especially if you like optimising and fiddling with code.I've played a fair bit now and, to me, this is one of the best puzzlers I've ever played.A few words about the gameplay in case you wonder: The game consists of 48 levels, each a programming task. Looking at the first screenshot here on Steam should show you the level SEQUENCE COUNTER. In the upper left corner you have your task. The 12 squares that take almost all of the screen are \"nodes\", independent CPUs that you can program freely with up to 15 instructions each. The arrows between them are \"ports\" that allow you to move data between nodes. There are also input and output ports at the top and at the bottom of the screen, respectively. Your program has to stand four tests, three with predefined inputs and one with random values. You can see the given inputs and expected outputs on the left in the screenshot.The programming language used is some very basic form of assembler consisting of just 13 opcodes (compared to the several hundred of a real Intel x86) . If you got prior programming experience or even worked with assembler, then this should be quite intuitive. For me it was definitly easier than the geometric approach of SpaceChem, Zach's previous game. Without any knowledge of programming the learning curve might be a bit steep as there is no tutorial, just a short manual. However, this should in no way discourage you. Pressing F1 brings up a quick reference of all opcodes and this game might actually enable you to understand the inner workings of a computer on a basic level so the educational value is immense.There is another aspect to this game, beyond merely completing the tasks: Of course you can solve a level in many different ways but the real challenge is to find the \"best\" way to do it. This is where your wet OCD dreams come true. Each solution gets a score consisting of the number of CPU cycles your program took to complete, the number of CPUs you used, and the length of your program. The game keeps track of the minimum you achieved in each of the three categories separatly. So naturally you start coding up optimised solutions for each category. This is where the only shortfalls of the game become apparent. First, you cannot really see the exact world records (it's a histogram view) so you cannot tell if your solution is already best possible. Second, you can only save three programs per level. With three variables to optimise this leaves you no space to try out new things. The first issue is remedied by a reddit thread (see https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/tis100\/comments\/391heb\/table_of_lowest_cyclesnodesinstructions\/) and the second can be worked around with manually copying and renaming solutions. But honestly, it's 2015 not the nineties, this shouldn't be necessary anymore.","Love it!This would not have been posible before steam.You should be smart, and like to tinker.WIthout prior programming exprience, this game will be very hard, but it is doable.","Very Good.","I had to actually read the instructions for this game. 10\/10","11 \/ 10 if you have an interest in programmingWTF \/ 10 if you don't","If real truckers played euro truck simulator you would think they were weird, this game is proof that programmers are weirdos10\/10","Fun game if you are just looking for a brush up on assembly, concepts.

As a software developer I took to this like a duck with water (and jeez it has been way too long for me and assembly).  The thing that amazes me about this game is that it makes programming a game that is fun for both the non-programmer and programmer alike.  It doesn't feel like work to me, and to those without coding experience it doesn't feel unapproachable.  Very well crafted indie title, and to anyone who even passingly fancies themselves as somewhat technically inclined it is a must-buy (unless you absolutely hate logic puzzles).","A collection of great logic puzzles wrapped up in a nostalgic interface.  I'm loving it!","If you are interested at all in learning how to program stuff on comptuters of other devices this is a great way to learn some fundamentals of programming. Even if you already have some programming skills this game is great to test your skills wiith limits to the amount of \"code\" you can write and only a few simple ocmmands.","Hard but worth the initial struggle","Part of what I loved about SpaceChem, one of Zachtronics' previous puzzle games (and probably their most well-known game), is that it captrued a lot of the problem solving skills inherent in programming. TIS-100 is a programming-themed puzzle game of the same ilk, by which I mean it gives you a goal and tools and lets you figure out how you want to solve it. Will you go for least number of cycles spent, making your solution the most time\/resource efficient? Or will you go for the solution that uses the fewest lines? Maybe you'd rather a more balanced solution? If you liked SpaceChem, chances are very good you'll like this.One thing I like about TIS-100 is that instead of feeding you story in between levels, it's hidden in the manual and \"corrupted\" nodes for you to suss out as you go along. It really adds to the exploratory feeling you get from their recommendation that you print out the manual and the note on the front of the manual that sets the game up as being you tinkering with a dead relative's unfinished computer project.I'm really happy with this game.","My fastest recommendation - after 20 minutes of play.  I'll see you in a few days.","Easy to learn. Hard to master. Seems overwhelming learning everything at first, then you start to get the idea.

They said, \"That is no game.\"","This is hands down the nerdiest game in existence, and I absolutely love it.For anyone who actually has any programming experience, the hardest part of this game will likely be the way the nodes work. There is no addressable memory in this game. Each node has a space for you to put code in, an accumulator (ACC), and a single register (BAK, which cannot be addressed directly) to save and swap to. Storing and moving data around consists mostly of passing it between nodes using the MOV command and the \"LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN\" keywords, which can get incredibly complex and confusing later on, but it's the primary challenge of the game.Anyone who wants a unique, interesting, and difficult challenge will likely be satisfied with this game, especially those who have some experience or interest in programming. However, this is not for everyone, and if the trailer doesn't remotely interest you, it's probably not worth it.","Very specific target audience but I love it! An original architecture to explore and create with that somehow provides a sense of accomplishment even though you are not accomplishing anything. ;)Makes me feel like I should re-direct my time toward learning REAL assembly languages and architectures instead.Having finished the main campaign I have to say my experience has been more engaging than any I can recall in recent years. It preoccupies my thoughts while showering, driving, eating, breathing.... Brutally challenging in its simplicity. Wonderfully handled in its look and feel.Will be looking forward to sequels or add-ons!","Another interesting technical puzzle game from Zachtronics, the makers of SpaceChem.This time it revolves around writing low level assembler-like code to solve various programming challenges within an interesting fictional multi-core computer.I made a video looking at the game and giving my thoughts on it:https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=R6lJFD2EKrkOver all I like the game. I haven't played much more of it since making that video since I got stumped a couple of levels later by the limited number of lines of code you can write for each cpu core.It hasn't held my interest for quite as long as SpaceChem, but I'll probably come back to it some time and try to make more progress through the levels.","This game is completely insane.I don't mean that this game is quirky, or frantic, or random. I mean that this game is absolutely certifiably mad. It has the insanity of a well-spoken schizophrenic, who presents a compelling, logical, and well-reasoned theory of the world in which the true masterminds are carrier pigeons.The TIS-100 is a beautifully crafted piece of virtual hardware from a world very different from ours. It's something that could have been made in the 80's, if we had fundamentally different assumptions about hardware design. Luxuries like multiple registers and programs more than 15 lines long are discarded in favor of easy visual debugging and a baffling degree of parallelism. Tasks that are trivial on reasonble hardware take careful consideration and lateral thinking on the TIS-100.This is the best puzzle game i've played in years. I recommend it to anyone who writes code for a living.","As a complete beginner to the world of programming, the feeling of satisfaction you get when you make something work is well worth the price.","If you have an interest in programming, I recommend this game strongly. If not, I would think this game would only serve to frustrate you. As a programmer myself, I adore the challenge in this game.

The game and manual stay in character to mimic an old computer. There are no tutorials or any flashy interface to break the illusion. Just figuring out how to start took a minute or two. So refreshing after all the hand-holding in other games.The statistics you get after each completed puzzle, as well as the achievements, give a lot of replay value. Optimizing your programs is often more fun than writing them in the first place!","This truly is a puzzle game.  The problem is that the puzzle is finding out what the game wants from you! It gives you this horrendous manual which really doesn't explain much and just throws you right in!

Even if you understand assembly :o","As a preface, I have next to no programming experience, but a vast and technical understanding of hardware. Programming has always been my weak point, due to its seemingly impermeable complexity; I don't think like a computer, and real programming language's mnemonics often make very little sense without researching and understanding a much deeper and intricate reason.This game is, simply put, QUITE AWESOME. It takes an extremely limited set of assembly mnemonics, and gives you an extremely limited, highly multithreaded enviromnet, and offers a clearly defined objective to achieve. The puzzles are not easy; in fact, these are some of the hardest puzzles I've had the pleasure of solving. The difficulty doesn't arise from the complexity of the task or obfuscation of the methods; no, it comes from the fact that you have such limited resources to achieve the goals. A normally simple and trivial multiplication program can easily become extremely challenging when you can only add, subtract, a stack memory (automatically pushes and pops), and a handful of conditionals. VERY fun and engaging!I highly recommend this game for anyone who wants to be able to break that initial impermeable layer of programming. Make no mistake, it will not teach you programming, at least, not in the normal sense; but it will help you to wrap your mind around the methods and semantics of programming within an extremely limited set of resources.A++ all around!","Fantastic game! Incredibly fun and has hoursof puzzles.","Very addicting game for those of us who find programming esoteric systems addicting.

Both the pain of learning to do *anything* with very little, and the joy of getting so much more done with even less. I think this is what the greybeards reminisce about when they talk about squeezing every last drop of utility out of a system. There's a strong feeling of nostolgia, of being a 10 year old in front of an inscrutible console and nothing but an afternoon to kill. I'm not old enough to remember the old terminals, but I did have a 286 with just the DOS command prompt and no manual or clue in the world; the TIS-100 recreates that feeling of intellectual exploration. Where a task looks insurmountable or impassible and you just don't have enough memory, or space for code, or just the wrong node is broken... But you know it can be solved. Or if the solution is obvious, you know it could be *better* - faster, smaller, simpler.So you just tinker with it, test ideas, and a solution forms. And then you refine it, and try newer ideas. Break things up, reinvent a few wheels. And while the computer cycles through your program watch what each algorithm does (espcially if nodes feed back to each other - you can literally watch execution bounce between chunks of code)!","If You like Challenging Programming, this is your Game...

If not you may or may not become interested in programming after playing for a bit. Personally, I have to limit myself when playing this game to about 1 hour a day (or 4 blocks) so I don't end up beating it in one long sitting and having nothing to fill the void that this game would leave once finished.Do not expect to learn asm from this game if that is what you are looking for.

If you know a lot about programming this game would come naturally to you, but if you don't really know much about programming you should still try it out if you're up to a challenge and want to learn something new. The commands aren't that complicated and you can learn them after studying the manual and the concepts a bit.","The screenshots should instantly tell you if this game is for you or not. It's basically short-form multicore asm puzzles, which is... a thing. It's Zachtronics, which is a seal of quality few can beat.

Those looking for something quick and relaxing will not find it here. But for those who take joy in simply learning something new, probing, and most importantly, creating, might just find their new favourite game with TIS-100.Read my full review here,http:\/\/another-castle.com\/2015\/08\/tis-100-review\/","Very good, but very hard. It shows the real pain of Assembly Programming."],["This game will be enjoyable if you like programming and thinking, so if you do I recommend it to you.","A great puzzle game for programming interested minds.","This is a living Review and will be updated as I play.First play through: Figured out the first puzzle after reading the manual, it was rewarding to solve that puzzle, I'm right now in the middle of the second one and I'm learning about the rest of what this TIS can do... it's pretty interesting and the plot that's hidden in the DEBUG logs is pretty interesting, it piques my curiosity.

It requires 100% concentration so my wife and family have been shut out of my office with orders not to disturb me under any circumstances. She probably thinks I'm having an online affair, but I must solve this next puzzle.I've now bought all the games from this developer. I will see them in a few weeks.","I am a programmer, but I moved from self-taught through a few courses to employment. At no time was I ever exposed to Assembly, and from the horror stories I heard I never sought it out. If this game is any indication whatsoever, then that is a shame because -- rather to my surprise -- I am enjoying thinking at such a (relatively) low level! And it is quite satisfying to solve a puzzle (and even more satisfying when you manage to improve your solution).As others have pointed out, this game is definitely worth a buy for anyone who is interested in programming. A word of caution though: it is not for the faint of heart, and there is definitely a learning curve with respect to some of the operations and behaviors, even (and perhaps especially?) for players with some experience. For example, if you are familiar with the *nix command mv, then you might think on first principles that MOV ACC, <DEST> clears ACC, but this is not the case. MOV is actually more like cp.In any event, this is a neat and innovative game. Great job, Zachtronics!"],["An absolutely wonderful puzzle game that every computer science major will instantly love.","It's literally a performance optimization simulation. If you enjoy optimizing code in a closed and highly constrained environment, you'll love this.Also, well designed difficulty curve.

It says \"Your programming skills suck. Why are you even here? LOL NOOB!\"It's really hard, especially once the game hands you a Stack Memory and expects you to be able to use it. But the TIS-100's weird architecture with its very limited registers and limited code length per core makes for very compelling puzzles that are challenging even if you already have a basic grasp of assembler. Once you solved a puzzle, you get compared to other players and can optimize your code for various goals: least number of code lines, least number of CPU cycles for test run, least number of cores used. Often, you need different approaches for either goal.I now kinda want a real TIS-100, no matter what a huge clusterf*ck its architecture is. But people who don't have at least some grasp of low-level programming concepts might end up really frustrated.","Have I mentioned before that I love everything Zachtronics does? Well, I do. This follows the same general concept of his other games, yet geared towards programmers.","If you ever wanted a mind bending puzzler about programming esoteric hardware in bespoke assembly code, this is most certainly the game for you.  The highly constrained processing architecture presents a large variety of challenges to accomplish even the simplest of tasks.  You'll never take C for  granted again!","One of the best games I've played. There is no mindless shooting so it may not appeal to everyone.Most of the negative reviews are from people that dont understand the game. There is no hand holding and no tutorial. All you get in instructions on what has to happen for the puzzle and a PDF that shows valid commands. For these people I would suggest going to youtube and watching someone play the game. Most explain what they are doing and why. Just watch one or two and there will still be plenty of levels to solve on your own.","What a fascinating game this is! By breaking all the rules of conventional game design and foregoing in-game tutorials and handholding, instead opting for a PDF manual that you're intended to actually print out, staple together, and keep on your desk as a constant companion piece to the game.From the launch onward the game is incredibly sober, never breaking character or acknowledging that it is a game at all. As soon as you launch this from your library you are presented with a windowed unix-looking 'bootloader' which brings you into the fictional TIS-100. There are no fourth-wall breaking menus or tutorials to deal with here.The manual itself is an invaluable part of the experiecne of this game. It looks beautifully authentic, the way it was typeset, printed, marked up with notes and highlights, then re-scanned to its final form.Though taken at face-value TIS-100 seems like a game aimed solely at programmers, it is at it's very heart a programming themed puzzle game. I personally have never written any low-level or assembly code, but was able to pick up the TIS-100's simple instruction set pretty quickly. Overall, this is a game for the patient problem solver. If you enjoy something with true 'hack-value', a challenge with no point other than overcoming it, then this is the game for you.","One of those games where you can stare at the screen for hours on end, not get anything done except lose a few hairs, but feel like you've worked so hard. It's just like real programming. It's beautiful."],["One of the most gripping and engaging puzzle games I've played in a long time. Full disclosure, I am currently a computer science student, so this game is sorta in my wheelhouse already, and I do have a fair amount of programming expirience. But this game is brilliant. Contrary to most, I don't think having a background in programming is necesarry to enjoy this game, but I will admit it does help. In terms of gameplay, it's a simple formula. You get a series of levels that slowly unlock as you complete more and more. Each puzzle gives you a set of instructions, which you then design a solution for. Were that all this game had to offer, it wouldn't be nearly as interesting as it is. But, on top of that, there's leaderboards, where you compare the effectiveness of your solution with others, which adds a lot to the fun of the game, as it reinforces the idea of not just finding a solution, but the best solution. Finally, and for me what elevates this game from really good to amazing, is there's an air of mystery and conspiracy in the game. If you pay attention to cryptic hints, there appears to be more going on then just moving around numbers. As a lover of stories in games, this is the factor for me that really puts this game head and shoulders above a lot of other puzzle games. All told, since I first started this game, I've not been able to stop thinking about it in the back of my mind, wondering about optimizing my code, improving solutions, and exploring the secrets in this game. As I said, this game is brilliant, and will pull you in, and not let go, if you let it. Also, just because it's worth mentioning, print out the game's manual. Trust me, you'll want to keep it handy. Plus, having a copy of it adds a lot to the immersion of this game.","This is like my job but better.","It's very much like SpaceChem, only more simplistic, rustic and without the pretty pictures (unless you have a fetish for bleak black & white squares).So, if you like SpaceChem, you most likely will like this game.If you don't like SpaceChem, you most likely won't like this game.If you don't know SpaceChem: Go play SpaceChem!"],["+ Easy Syntax+ Simple Layout+ HDD sounds!+ Creative \"Storytelling\"Very enjoyable programming.It makes one think of other ways of filtering data.","This game is like Infinifactory distilled down into something that is even better.","If your idea of fun is solving algorithmic problems in a extremely limited assembly language, then I can wholeheartedly recommend this game."],["I beat the hidden puzzle.

No fun to find solutions to the rest of the puzzles on youtube. This creator is known for creating difficult puzzles. Although I got to admit this game inspired me to create my own assembly programming game. If I perhaps take a class or two on assembly programming I would probably recommend this for experienced minds.What makes this game hard is that their are nine nodes that act on their own clocks. I have never manually managed 9 simultaneous processes  so I do not know how to manage a system like that. If their was one node that procedurally executed op codes this game would be easier. You also have to pipeline your processes which quickly complicates things. The reason for this is that each node is limited on the amount of op codes you can process.Although I had fun. I do not recommend this to my friends as none of them program. What would make this game more ledgit would be a tutorial on how you should manage the nine nodes. I however recommend this game to experienced minds.","Excellent little programming-puzzle game. You don't need to know how to program, but if you do it surely helps.

Can't recommend it enough, if you like puzzles and have an interest in programming don't even think about it.","Extremely niche, but rewarding if it fits your interest. I just wish it wasn't written in Unity, which is overkill and heavyweight for such a simple game.","A great game for programmers and non programmers alike.

This is a really good programming puzzle game. If you capital-love these games too, this will be good for you!If not, you'll probably hate it. There is nothing here for you if you are not already a fan of this genre. If Spacechem intimidated you, back away now.","If you like SpaceChem you should probably get this game.","Great little game that has its own version of simple assembly language programming. I feel that the assembly language can be very limiting at times (only 15 lines allowed), and I'm used to using way more than 2 registers (only one of which can be directly accessed) in real assembly programming, so it's pretty challenging. But, it's challenging in a pretty fun way, and the way the computing nodes work mean that you can use other nodes as extra registers, caches or for more complex architectural things like pipelining (instruction-level parallel processing) or a multiprocessor system (albeit a very limited one).Game is pretty short, but still worth the money in my opinion.","Overall: If you like programming, or puzzle solving this is a great game. You should be warned that you need to type out what you want to do to solve a problem. That means you need to watch out for your syntax. It is difficult, there is a steep learning curve to newcomers to programming. Don't let that discourage you, this could be an amazing learning experience.Story: There is a cute little story line that runs through the puzzles. It adds flair to what may seem to be a pretty bleak interface. But that bleakness, along with the story add to the charm of the style of the game.Visualization: It is a seriously fun game if you are interested in programming in any way. And while it may seem to be a \"game\" only for programmers, after a while you will begin to see the flow of information and realize that there is some great graphical elements that give you feedback. But you need to look for them in how the nodes communicate, and what is in the node at any given time.Replayability: I've nearly beat the main part of the game. And at first it seems like everything goes fast, but the challenges grow. If you worry about replayability, there is options for optimizing your puzzle solutions in 3 different ways. Then you can compare your solutions performance to your friends. I think this game is best played with a friend to talk about it with and push you to work harder. Not only that but there is a whole second set of puzzles available, which I've not even touched on yet. There is also some fun challenges through achievements that in some cases require a bit of creativity.Teachers should probably assign this game as homework. Better yet, classwork.TL;DR: Loved it.

If this Game is to hard for you there is another far easier assembler inspired game on Steam: Human Resource Machine","I stink at writing reviews but I'll try for this one.  This game is about writing small assembly language programs in a tiny instruction set with a minuscule amount of memory.  Making a working program is not too hard for most of the puzzles, but optimizing them is extremely hard.  I've apparently played this 171 hours, and I haven't finished all the puzzles yet, let alone optimized them, so there is an enormous amount of value.This is similar to Human Resource Machine, but quite a bit harder, much much longer, less visually produced (though still very attractive), and with somewhat different instruction sets and restrictions on memory use that make programs quite a bit different.TIS-100's main difference from standard assembly, other than the restrictions, is its quasi-parallel programming focus.  This is the game's chief conceit and it does play a huge role in the programs.  You will learn the main strategies for getting the twelve processors to work together, and to send data and signals between them, by playing the first several levels.I highly recommend this game for anyone who enjoys programming.  It's very challenging, and I hope that TIS-200 includes a larger instruction set and a way to define named subroutines that can be accessed from any program."],["If you enjoy programming or the logic required for programming then you'll love TIS-100.

If that sounds strange to you, then you may want to stay away from this one...The TIS-100 architecture is easy to learn, but hard to master. The puzzles are well designed, rewarding, and they will reveal a mysterious sub-plot as you progress. After successfully completing a puzzle you will see metrics on your code (resources used, efficiency, etc), and you can compare your stats to other players. There is a slight learning curve, and the difficulty seems to increase endlessly, so you don't have to worry about running out of challenges.I may never complete all the puzzles, but that won't stop me from firing up this game and hacking away at some difficult puzzles to kill some time. If you get tired of trying new puzzles, you can always go back to your old sequences and challenge yourself to see how much you can optimize them by rewriting their code.","I've found this game fun so far. I solve a puzzle a day or so. The simple command set is really deceptive as this can make solutions far more difficult than having available more complex functions, methods, or stored procedures. Try reversing a sequence without an array, or concatenation, or a vector object, no tables or pages, nor tags...And having a single value registry with slightly under 11 bits of memory in a single signed integer to work with as memory.So far, so good, however difficult :)","Ingenious game.  Like other reviewers have noted, first two levels are cake, then you get a punch in the face.  Disagree with those though that say this isn't code or programming.  This a lot like what you'll do day to day in some software jobs (operations, configuration management, quality assurance, etc.)   I'd go as far as saying the problem solving in the game is more relevant for a software job than 90% of the technical interview questions that you see floating on the internet","This game is so awesome. Even if you're not a programmer, don't let that dissuade you. It's very simple to get into.","A must play for programmers. Remind me of the old fun days doing computer system lab project. 10\/10","A fun little game to play with if your interested in assembly language, CPU's and low level programming.","*almost understands*\"this is nothing but a MIND\"*finally gets it*\"IM A GENIUS IM SO GOOD IM NOT JUST A LIME BRAIN ANYMORE SO SMART\"","Best puzzle game since Assembler came out.","Amazing, highly addictive game. For the record, I am a software engineer and despite the fact that I code for living and this game makes me code in my spare time too, really fun.Highly recommended","Awesome game.  Very fun and highly recommended.  I hated assembly in college, but somehow I can't stop playing.","Awesome game","Okay, I've previously played Spacechem and this beats it. I've only made it through the first half dozen levels and it's good and difficult while not being impossible.The real elegance of the game is it's simplicity. The simulated computer is so simple but that's very deceptive. I'm also drawn by the blocks with debug, I'm sure there's more to those but haven't found anything yet.The fact that I've been playing it for two hours without realizing it is also a great thumbs-up. It's enthralling.","Great puzzle game, difficulty goes up pretty fast.","Who doesn't love assembly?","While this game is certainly a great time for me (a programmer), you should keep in mind that this game is not for the faint of heart. Keep the manual with you at all times and you will have a blast. 9.5\/10, simply because it doesn't make the key click noises from Emily is Away.","Computer assembly programming game, fun and interesting for those willing to learn the syntax and RTFM, but probably beyond the reach of the console plebs.","I wish this game was how my programming homework looked like.","If 'programming puzzle' is something that sounds interesting to you, then go for it.","This is solvable. It's about input, and output, and processing. It's about thinking how to produce a solid result out of some input with a limited (yet powerful!) set of instructions and modules.Some people talk here about assembly languages, and they're wrong and totally correct: it's not an assembly language while it looks like it is one.All I know that this puzzle? worth trying. No matter want \/ love you to write code and debug it or not. No matter have you important things to care of.Is it a casual game? Yes.Is it a puzzle? Yes.Is it about programming? Yes.Is it about something else? Indeed. All you need is to try and solve it!N.B.: Its manual is clear and easy. Grab and use!","Only had the game a day, I'm on the sequence generator one now, each puzzle seems slightly harder than the last.I program in java, so I have a knack for moving numbers about and logical things, although I've never done assembly stuff before.Excellent game so far, at first I didn't know what was going on, I still have to get to grips with labels and jumps a bit more.I think people poor at math or programming may get frustrated with it, but maybe not.Nothing to lose though, so buy this game now!","Awesome!","Good and worth the purchase, but short. I have 40 hours on it, but most of those are from leaving it open in the background all day and night. I probably put less then 5 hours into it so far, and beat the final puzzle. I still have to 100% it and the acheivements, which will still add hours of fun, but compared to SpaceChem or Infinifactory it seems short and easy.","A wonderful little puzzle game. Very fun. Compare your solutions to your friends."],["One of the most enjoyable puzzle games I've played in a very, very long time.Ignore the fact there are no fancy visuals, or cute sound effects, no fancy physics or construction. This game will tax your logic and reasoning to it's limit. For a while at least (more on this later)I'll not spoil the excellent little plot line that runs throughout the game, lets just say there is one.I have some knowledge of programming and scripting, but I've never used assembly before even though I've experienced it's usage. It is arguably the most beautiful language known to man. Even in it's more modern forms like x86_64. Especially if you've ever touched hex-code...*shudders*You DONT need ANY programming experience whatsoever to enjoy this. There are a handful of instructions that you can input to a node and you'll have memorised those by the end of the third puzzle. You will however need to play with them a bit to fully understand how the nodes cycle and what will cause a halt. I must say, despite being rather authentic, the manual doesn't really serve the same function a real manual for a machine of this type. There just isn't enough information about data flow and cyclic processes. This doesn't matter though, a few trial and error attempts at the first tricksy little puzzleses and you'll break through that wall. This game will get into your head. Because the language is  so natural and simple, you'll start devising programs and sequences while you're at your real job, doing real work, with real code. Just to finish that puzzle that stumped you the evening before.I must reiterate that this is something anyone can play. You might be scratching your head by the 6th puzzle, but just keep your wits about you and you'll be able to do it. The payoff is a fantastic feeling of satisfaction we often don't get anymore. If you're unsure about how computers actually work and process information, this is a very good starting point to understand it, too!Two thumbs up to the devs, stirling job.Wish List!-Ambent fan and HDD noise, display hum? (preferably related to programs running)-'Retro' visual effects like curvature, scan and flicker (optional!)-More puzzles!-More Instructions-More Alternate output and input types (get inventive :D)","UPDATE: Since I originally reviewed this game, I've since played it for nearly 200 hours and beat every single puzzle in the game. I got addicted hard to this game, and even though I was terrible I just kept at it until I persevered. If you're the kind of person who gets obsessed, you'll definitely get your money's worth here.Original Review:I hated playing this game at first. Not because it was bad, but because I was really bad at it. I had absolutely zero prior programming experience. I couldn't even solve the first few puzzles on my own. But something about it just made me keep playing. Once you get the hang of the instructions it becomes really addicting.I still probably won't be able to beat the game, but I've enjoyed the hours I've gotten out of it, and the few satisfying moments when I finally cracked a hard puzzle.If you enjoy a difficult challenge then I recommend it, whether you know how to code or not.P.S. I just thought I'd also mention that you can get jump commands from other nodes by using JRO <direction>. They didn't explain that very well in the manual and I spent half the game using a more convoluted amalgamation of JMP, JLZ, and JGZ instructions. Also F1 brings up a shorter version of the manual on the screen so you don't have to keep tabbing out to look at it","This game is a really good start for anybody that wants to get into assembly. It shows how to structure the simple parts of code.","If you like Zachtronics other games, you will probably like this.  But I have a few problems with it.  The first is that it's not precisely what's on the tin.  It says you're rewriting corrupted code segments, but what I've seen so far is to take input values do things to them and out put them.  It's not really looking for what's wrong with exisiting code.  Since you're just writing programs to do things, why not just actually make programs that do actual things?I'll play a bit more and later update my review if my ideas change, but like all Zachtronic games so far, it seems more like work than a puzzle to me, because it just requires you to do increasingly complicated things, not to be clever.","This is a great game for a specific target audience. If you have at least some programming experience and you enjoy logic puzzles this game is for you. If that doesn't apply to you than you may want to reconsider buying it. Worth $7 and if this game is on sale for less it's a no brainer to buy.","This game is simply amazing.  I just cannot recommend this game enough.No prior programming knowledge needed.","This is an amazing game:You have a couple of processors which can exchange data through connections between them.These processors constitute a network. Your task is to program the processors such that their network processes input data into some wanted output data. E.g. you input a stream of numbers and it should output a stream of numbers with twice the value of the original values each.The fun comes from the limitations:- Each processor has only two registers and it can only keep 15 lines of instructions.- The assembly language has only a few instructions and few address modes.- You have up to 12 nodes- There are CPU nodes and stack memory nodes so far (I in the middle of the game right now)- You can communicate with up to four neighbour nodesUnder these conditions you have to program the network to solve a given task.Each solutions is put through automated tests which decide if your solution is valid or not.You get some stats on network speed, node usage and instruction count, so you get an idea how efficient your solution is compared to others.This is a beautiful simulation of assembly programming, digital signal processing and distributed computation.Plus there there is some sci-fi background story about the device you play with.All in 1980s micro computer look and feel. But beware: My wife thought I was hacking the local energy central, this game looking so hackerish, which got me into a nasty boss fight.","I knew literally nothing about assembly language before purchasing this game. I just saw it had really great reviews and went for it. I have completed the first four segments and it was so, so satisfying!  To help others who know nothing get started:- Read the manual! It may not make sense at first, but if you keep looking back and forth between the manual and the first segment, things will start to click.- To get started, look at the boxes in the first segment. Instructions are in the top left, so read those, then run the program and see what it does. Compare In.X with In.A and start filling in the boxes on the right. :)- Use step by step to see where exactly you have problemsEnjoy!","\"Run for fun?

Not for the faint of heart.Even if you already know assembly programming, this game is HARD.  Only 13 commands, max 15 lines of code per node, and only one accumulator \/ \"variable\".  Take some Aspirin before playing.That being said, the \"plot\" of this game, though simple, pretty much has me hooked.  I was actually willing to slog through the tougher puzzles, just to read further.  And there's a second (sub?)plot once you complete the main \"story\".","If the idea of thinking outside the box (or inside several boxes, actually) about solving problems using an unusual parallel computing architecture with a limited assembly language instruction set appeals to you, then you absolutely need to pick up this game.

Sadly, i discovered that i'm not smart enough to solve the majority of the puzzles, and resorted to cheating :(","This is one of the most entertaining programming related games I've played in a while.Don't buy this if you're looking for an actual game.

Unfortunately, there are a few major flaws that detract from the overall experience and turned \"fun\" into \"frustration.\"First and foremost would be the lack of any tutorial. The game relies on you taking time to read the manual and if you try jumping right in, you will be lost. Unfortunately, the manual relies heavily on the reader having some experience with programming and is often needlessly opaque in its language. Essentially, it's a chore to read. The first couple of levels get progressively harder, which is a great way to get acquainted with what the game wants you to do. Unfortunately, as I said before, not everything is well explained in the manual so you may find yourself \"missing\" key commands you need to get through a puzzle.Second problem (at least in my opinion) was the format of the game itself. You have fifteen puzzles to solve, and you unlock more as you complete the prior ones. Although this concept itself doesn't bother me, the way the game is set up doesn't give me much replay value. It relies heavily on you going through later and optomizing your code, something that I am ambivalent to. I do not hate optomizing code, but it's not something I enjoy, and certainly not what I want all of the replay value of the game to consist of.The story is interesting, and I do like the way it is integrated into the gameplay. I also like that you have blocks that you can't use and have to work around, unfortunately these two things could not salvage the experience for me. It all boils down to a boring manual, little replay value (for myself), and little opportunity to create your own stuff with the code (as what you are given is very limited in scope).This is by no means a bad game, but unfortunately, it just wasn't the game for me and as such, I cannot recommend it.","It gives just enough info to find out what to do. Its great.","Best brain teaser I've ever played. Assembly programming is almost a lost art nowadays and I hope this game will help to get people interested in this topic. Game is simple enough to be understood by a non-programmer, but if you are an honest achievement hunter like me - it'll get you stumbled in some places. I do some of my work in AVR assembly, which means I'm at a bit of an advantage here, but I haven't had so much fun since making an emulated MIPS processor in Logisim few years ago.Includes tons of puzzles, including community-created content. Accompanied by very helpful user manual.","GOTY","This is actually a really fun puzzle game, don't be intimidated by it's retro look and assembly language aesthetics. I actually discovered this game in the steam store after working through a tutorial on 6502 assembly language (the one used by the Commodore 64, search \"Easy 6502\"). What makes the game fun and not just a virtual machine on Steam, is that it is very limited so that you have to use communication between the nodes to get things done. OK probably not very convincing, but seriously, give it a try, it's surprisingly fun!","It reminds me of the days when I was a hacker.","The only puzzle game in which I haven't cheated.mov 10, rating","If you enjoyed Spacechem or Infinifactory, this is much the same, except instead of moving elements and machines, you move numbers around. Chances are you'll know if this game is your style just by looking at it. This game has given me an appreciation both for low-level and high-level coding. Nice story as well, to the same tune as Spacechem.","If you're a programmer and you like puzzles, then you'll really enjoy this game. Most of the puzzles will be quite simple to do if you're an experienced one, but it's also fun to optimize the solutions (there are also some interesting challenges to get achievements.)If you're not a programmer, you could still probably get into it, but, you'd have to be somewhat patient and willing to learn a bit. Be warned that all you get is a 14-page technical document, which is good and contains a lot of relevant information. But you will have to read through it and understand it, and if that's not your sort of thing then you might want to look elsewhere. (Take note of the F1-key tip for a quick reference.)Also, I really like the whole idea of the parallell architecture which makes you think a bit differently.","Simplified version of assembly made fun. It's not that challenging for those who are already familiar with real assembly languages but you can still challenge yourself by optimising your solutions. However, if you aren't slightly interested in programming this is definetely not for you."],["10\/10 would read manual again","Let me just preface this review by saying that if you have no programming experience at all, this game will seem quite daunting at first glance, but should you get it: yes.I think games these days are shifting a bit far from logical skill towards twitch reaction skill. I can happily say that this game is all logic. If you've spent the last 5 years playing nothing but CoD, your reactions will be great, but that won't matter at all in this game. This game is all about thinking through a situation (often step-by-step). So, for the people that don't know, the game is about writing lines of their simplified version of assembly inside of (relative to modern machines) tiny nodes with specific objectives for every 'segment' which you can call a level, I suppose. The objectives for each level range from easy to head-banging-into-keyboard hard. The game does have a story, but to be honest, I haven't payed on ounce of attention to it, although I've heard it's at least decent, so there's that. The main thing that makes me want to review this game so well, is that it's challenging in an interesting way. Dark Souls, for example, is challenging for multiple reasons (one being the game just hates you) primarily revolving around reacting quickly. I'm not saying that this is an inferior skill to have, I'm just saying the thrill is immediately taken away when you go to try again, and you know what's going to happen, because it already happened. This game is completely different. If you fail at a level, you still haven't figured out the logic required to solve the (often real world related) problem. You can't just try once, fail, get the answer, succeed. To succeed in this game you need to apply logic, which, as any programmer will tell you, is essential. Now, I'll say this now: I haven't finished the game... YetI did say it's difficult. I'm an experienced programmer, but have only touched real assembly about 4 or so times. I imagine someone who has written assembly for 80+ years, helped invent the language, and practices it every morning in the mirror, might not have too much trouble with these problems, but what the rest of us are left with is an excellent, difficult, educational, 'puzzle' problem solving programming game.It's hard to write a 'review' of this game because it knows exactly which crowd of people it wants to advertise to, and if you jumped at the though of a game where you write a basic version of assembly, you are in that crowd.TL:DRDifficult, educational, and completely logic oriented game that anyone interested in programming should pickup, and those people should try Python (language) too!","Very hard. Very fun. Come in with some basic assembly programming skills, or be prepared to learn a lot.","Daaaaaaamn! That RISC ISA is off the hook! Pipeline like a pimp!Where dat shift instruction tho, amirite? Powers of two, playa!Always loved the tedium of doing what a compiler could do better anyway!","The most important thing about programming is not how to write in a specific language, or how many you know. It's the actual logic and theory of programming, and just how it works. If you can firmly grasp those core concepts, learning a new programming language is just learning how to say things you already know but with different words, hence the use of the word \"languages\".For those who don't know how to program, and are either interested or are looking to improve their grasp of programming theory, this game is fantastic. If you can successfully comprehend the manual and complete even just half of this game, you'll go into whatever programming 101 class with a huge advantage over anyone else who's new to the field.","Did you ever play SpaceChem and think \"I wish this assembly line was a grid network of accumulator machines\"?","If you haven't played spacechem yet, go do that first.OK, did you like it?

A game where my third-year computer science subjects on algorithm design are genuinely useful!This is unashamedly a programming game. The puzzles are well designed and compact. The machine limitations are enough to make it challenging, but not so hard as to make it impossible.","What a game!! Not only are some of the puzzles challenging enough on their own, trying to improve upon them for either code density or performance makes this game immensely enjoyable. Nearly pulled an all-nighter the first night I played the game. The lure of solving another puzzle was too much for me ;) Luckily it's the holidays, lol.On a serious note, anyone interested in assembly language in general should consider this game. It will serve as a great introduction to assembly as well as help pass the time. A win-win in my books.TIS-100 = VRISC (very reduced instruction set computer) = FUN!!!","I really love this game, its as much about thinking logically as it is about programming. I am a junior programmer, so found it very easy to pick up, and found the puzzles really stimulating. I manage to solve them fairly quickly (not finished yet, only started playing today) but then I have always been good at logic puzzle games, and still found this really enjoyabe. Definitely recommended for anyone who enjoys logic\/programming puzzles. If you enjoyed The Talos Principle for example, and think you can get the hang of something like this fairy easily, then definitely give it a go.","Amazing simulator of coding in assembly. Should be compulsory syllabus at computer science courses.","I hadn't written assembly code for about 7 years, though I've been developing in higher level languages since that time.This game has realy made me remember and appreciate how brain-gratingly frustrating it is to be force to write messy, clumsy code due to limitations in memory and program length. In fact, that's the restriction this game imposes to make it more puzzle-like. I recommend if you see programming as solving puzzles.I do not recommend if you see programming as a design discipline.","Reminds me of the old days when I wrote all the notorious GOTO statements by hand.","This is a fantastic game and I regret only buying it in a steam sale.

Overall community statistics are provided for each puzzle.+ The grades above provide plenty of replayability: there's always a way to shave off a few more cycles!+ The parallel CPU architecture provides a unique twist on typical assembly programming.+ It's very satisfying and rewarding to solve the complicated puzzles.+ Since when were engineers given black-and-white software requirements?Cons:- Steep learning curve, particularly if you have no programming experience.- For the nerds: the program memory implementation is rather annoying, even whitespace, labels, and comments (ha!) use up valuable memory. I would enjoy the game much more if you were limited by the number of instructions instead. Have fun with your wall of unformatted code in some puzzles!For the nerds:I'd highly recommend this game if you have a passion for programming. You likely won't have any issues  conceptualizing the overall puzzle solutions. Your challenge will be optimizing those solutions or figuring out how to implement them on the limited\/unique CPU architecture.I never thought I'd work with something that makes 1980s era microcontrollers look powerful. You're in for a treat when you realize you only have one addressible working register available per CPU core! I died a little on the inside when I found myself repurposing cores as primitive RAM\/register modules...For the less nerdy:This game will have a steep learning curve if you aren't familiar with basic programming concepts. With that said, the game has a simplified model and anyone with a logical mind could pick this up. The puzzles almost always have simple (albeit naive from a programming standpoint) solutions available. I'd recommend the game as long as you're willing to learn, the struggle will be rewarding.","This game is why I'm thankful that I don't have to write space-limited Assembly in this day and age.","I am a lab assistant for computer architecture course, and it gives me new assignment ideas.","Very different, very addictive and you might learn something too.","Do you like programming?

If you're at all interested in programming, then you should at least give this one a go. There are some real brain burners! It reminds me a lot of another game I enjoy, SpaceChem.","Before playing this game, I thought Intel's x86 instruction set had way too many mnemonics. This game has made me appreciate all the tools at my disposal when I need to waste time coding in assembly language.","For an (experienced) assembly programmer the puzzles are not that hard to solve. Where the real game kicks in is, if you want to unleash the power of assembly and squeeze every last cycle out of it to get the most optimized solution. This is where it really shines. I wrote the first few solutions for a start but then I couldn't sleep because I was all the time thinking about alternative approaches to make it better. I had to get up in the middle of the night just to see if my idea is performing better than the last one.So yes, definitely a recommendation! For people trying to get an idea what assembly programming is about, it might even be a good start to snoop in, without the difficulties of real assembly programming.You have to read the documentation to get an idea what comands are available and what you can do, and usually I hate it, when I have to read the manual just to play the game. However, the PDF was fun to read, and if you focus on the commands you can just look them up as you go.","This game is amazing.

The first puzzle made me think \"wut\" since there is no tutorial, but once I figured out how to move the numbers and how to use the commands, the game became much more easier to understand and solve.

It's very similar, but instead of everything being visual you learn a very simplified fake programming language. It's not daunting, and you don't have to know anything about coding. A detailed manual is included that will get you started, and after that it's just a bunch of logic puzzles basically. An interesting story seems to be unfolding via \"notes\" left in the system debugger by the previous owner. Right from the start you get the impression that there is something really intriguing about the history of the TIS-100 and you'll want to keep solving puzzles to find the next note and see how it all unfolds. If you like lo-fi indie gaming, logic puzzles, and cold war mysteries this game is a must buy, and I'm saying this within the first hour of playing it. I have a feeling I'm going to be spending A LOT of time with the TIS-100 over the next few days (or weeks, I have no idea how many puzzles there are). 10\/10.EDIT: Now that I'm thinking about it there is one minor annoyance: no soundtrack.

However, you don't need to know programming to understand the game. It certainly helps, but this game is less about writing code and more about the logic processes involved in building a solution. If you have a logical mind and enjoy puzzles, this game may be for you. If you enjoy programming, this game is most definitely for you.The game uses a fictional implementation of an assembly type language. You get a manual in PDF form. Yes, you have to read a manual. It's not complicated though, as there are only a handful of operations available to you. There's enough to allow for interesting solutions yet limited enough to make the game challenging. A very good balance between the two, I'd say.Regarding the puzzle aspect, you're expected to work with nodes, each only allowing a limited number of lines and containing two memory registers (no addressable memory!), only one of which can be actively accessed for read\/write operations. As a result, you need to structure your program around these limitations, perhaps by breaking it down into various components.The problems are varied and quite grounded in real-world applications (sequence peak detector, histogram, etc.). The game is simplistic and doesn't hold your hand, but the problems are organized such that there's a clear difficulty curve as you progress. The curve should be quite manageable for those with prior experience in programming.There are also leaderboards so you can compare how efficient your solution was compared to your friends, because who doesn't like improving?Wholeheartedly recommend this to anyone who loves programming.","Simple, yet very captivating puzzle game that even force you to read manual :)","That's definitely the softest intro course to assembler I have ever seen :)Not sure that it will be fun for anyone not familliar with basics of programming, otherwise very much recommended.","So this game is a programming game. In it you input, modify, and output numbers using scripts. While there isn't a tutorial, there's a detailed manual, and it's a very fun experience figuring it out.

I'm not sure if you can share them, but the creation tool is there, which is nice.I would definetly recommend. Best played when you're wide awake.","The beauty of this game lies in its simplicity. You have a handful of commands and nodes to work with and the problems themselves are not difficult. If you have any prior knowledge in assembly language coding, everything will come very naturally. If you have any other programming knowledge, translating it to assembly language is easy, there are fewer commands and structures to understand, just the art of creating the perfect algorithm. If you have no programming knowledge, be prepared for a bit of a steep learning curve, especially since the game itself does not provide any tutorials. Getting back to the game, the solutions aren't hard, hammering out a crude solution can be done, but then comes looking at your solution and trying to find inefficiencies, trying to find a way to cut down that one line of code, use one less node ... that's where you will loose a few hours of your life.","#value#worthif working would be this fun, I'd never stop","WILL utilize 99% of your logic processor.Could be used as a learning tool for programming?1337\/10"],["Games isn't bad, but it lacks the ambience of it's precessors.

I've always thought of writing assembly as a type of puzzle game, so I consider this very fitting. Zachtronics has created a new assembly language, consisting of 15 instructions, for TIS-100. The instruction set has some neat features but also includes severe limitations to make the puzzles more challenging. You don't have any bit shift, multiplication, division, or return jumps, but the puzzles are designed such that the absence of such features makes the puzzles challenging without feeling crippling.My only complaint would be that the game pretends to have a story, but does not have a story. It teases you with elements of a narrative that are very cleverly composed and will have you itching to learn more, but at the end you are rewarded with _absolutely nothing_. One component of the ending is flashed to you once for a split second and then you are NEVER ALLOWED TO VIEW IT AGAIN, but you can look it up online to see it is nothing. There is also a secret level that rewards you with more nothing upon completion.

Hats off to the devs.","Uncle Randy unexpectedly passed away recently and you have inherited an old computer he was working on  a machine that was manufactured in 1980 known as the TIS-100.  Unfortunately much of the operating systems code is corrupted  despite your late uncles best efforts to repair it  rendering the computer's origin and purpose a mystery.  Now that your curiosity has been piqued, will you be able to finish his work and figure out the reason for its existence?If the synopsis doesn't intimidate you then the games front end probably will.  It is an assembly language programming interface and you must come up with the code required to solve the conundrums it presents.  These problems often seem deceptively simple to resolve, and initially they are, but thanks to the limited number of instructions available on such an archaic system  not to mention the limited space to enter code  they quickly become very challenging.  As far as puzzle games go, TIS-100 makes Sudoku look about as threatening as noughts and crosses... but that is not a criticism; the complexity is what makes it so good.You just have to understand before buying that it gets very hard very quickly, and any satisfaction comes out of learning new concepts and solving the problems yourself.  This sometimes involves spending considerable time making notes and devising solutions on paper because the mental gymnastics required of you occasionally get too much.  Yes, it can be frustrating, but its a fantastic feeling when the solution finally hits you.  I even had a couple of great Scott moments while taking a bath and ended up rushing  stark-naked and dripping-wet  to my untrusty TIS-100 for that much sought-after rush.Obviously this game will appeal to programmers more than most, but such credentials aren't essential.  Youre just as likely to enjoy it if you got good grades in maths and are partial to number puzzles.  On the other hand, Ive come across users who don't fit this profile and love the game, but for this type of person I think the initial purchase will always be a gamble.Consequently, I give TIS-100 a glowing recommendation but with the caveat that it wont be everyones cup of tea.","Must have game for all those who are interested in assembler and puzzle games. Sometimes the challenges can be hard, but I never lost fun in solving them","Almost all games can lean on graphical fidelity to a degree to enhance their appeal. TIS-100 is an exception to this rule. Yes it has a rudamentary graphical interface which is styled in the command line aesthetic, but it's not trying to be visually appealing like undertale or terraria. It's functional, and that's all that it's really there for. TIS-100 is therefore unusual because the pure and distilled form of a game; that is: something that has rules and a winning condition.The rules are simple, and well laid out in the manual which accompanies the game. They are simple commands that can be used to manipulate data in a certain way. I have no background in programming or coding and I could quite easily understand them.The goals are also simple, you have to take input(s) and turn them into output(s) using the commands laid out in the rules.The solutions however, are anything but simple. You have to think through problems to use simple logic to come up with ingenious solutions to the problems. However, after the first few puzzles, you will likely be left scratching your head for a bit. But this is the best part of the game! You keep at it untill you find the solution and a glorious stream of numbers are spat out from your code indicating that you have successfully achieved the goal. The feeling of reward when this happens is larger than i've felt in a game for a long time. The lack of hand holding in this game does make it difficult, but it only amplifies the rewards at the end of a puzzle because you'll have solved it all on your own. The puzzles themselves are varied, and the developer has clearly spent a long time devising them. There is also much replayability, as you can see how many commands and steps it took others to solve the puzzles, so you can try to optimise your own code to be like the best of them.Ultimately, it's a game of pure logic. If that sort of thing floats your boat then I whole heartedly reccomend it. If you're more of a non stop action kind of gamer, or someone who just loves a good story, then you probably won't like it. Horses for courses, or courses for horses; which ever way round the saying goes.9\/10","Dark Souls is hard for twitchy people.TIS-100 is hard for thinky people.","Amazing game! It is extremely fun to play and the puzzles are very complex while also simple.This game is a good pass-time for programmers and people even people who are good with logic and numbers. I love how the complexity of executing the tasks in the puzzles are not hard themselves( most of the time) but the difficulty comes from the simplicity of the code and the confinement of the node. Since you only have 15 lines per node, you must use them wisely and since the code is very simple, you need to make shortcuts to move things around efficiently and correctly. There are 2 folders of puzzles and a steep increase in difficulty so you can be working for hours at a time. This game is really good at making you feel good when you fix a bug but not too demotivated when your code doesn't work properly. It even has a pretty cool story and really awesome secrets.

Even though everything in TIS-100 looks like \"programmer-ese\", all the commands and functions that you use to solve puzzles relate to each other in very logical and easy to understand ways. The challenge comes from making these commands interact in ways that solve the objective of each level (or \"node\" as the game calls it).I'm sure programmers will have an easier time with this game, but I'm having tons of fun understanding how things work via trial and error, and understanding how to use all the different commands to bring about many different results. As long as you are able to think logically, even if you don't know a single thing about programming, you can definitely work through this game too!","This. Game. Is. Fantastic.

MOV YOU, HELL","I kinda like it. It is a neat little assemblyish puzzle game.","A good small programming game. I personally prefer my games of this style to be more gamified(or obfuscated), meaning straight up using a limited programming language to build puzzles around doesnt really work for me. I have done some programming before(really random training stuff) and as such TIS-100 very much felt like stuff I have done before, as opposed to Spacechem or Infinifactory that feel fresh.Now that said TIS-100 was plenty fun enough to (mostly)go through escpecially thanks to the early learning curve with the manual and such. But this was the first and last game that, for me, gets away with just using a simplified programming language for math puzzles. I know I have been and will continue to ignore Human Resource Machine because of this for example. If you have played that one prior you might still get quite a bit out of TIS-100 since this is a significantly harder game(from what I have seen), but be aware that the early\/mid game stuff is going to be a whole lot of the same\/similar math problems.","If you're not a developper, this game allows you to prove you can be one.If you're a dev though, it just can prove you're not the best one ^^I am a dev, I loved SpaceChem, and the mechanics here looks simpler but really nerder.Lovely !!","It's a pretty good game","Yes, please more!","Although this game may have a steep learning curve compared to many others, the challenge of completing various \"simple\" tasks in a stripped-down assembly language is incredibly enthralling. What most programming languages can accomplish in a single line of code (e.g. multiplication, division) may require two-to-three dozen instructions in this game. On its face, this concept sounds quite dull, but after working through the first few puzzles, you will find that it is pure magic. Each task stretches the brain immensely, and indeed, some of the later tasks may take several hours of thinking, programming, and debugging to solve. This perseverance ultimately rewards you with a sense of accomplishment and a newfound insight into the lowest-level workings of a computer.To break much of the tedium of programming for hours on end, the game supplies an intriguing backstory into the nature of the TIS-100 computer system, communicated through several journaled entries by the previous owner of the fictional machine. My only gripe is that this story, despite all of its potential, simply does not provide enough depth to be satisfying. Whereas well-developed stories weave into the game seamlessly, motivating the player to continue playing in order to reveal more of the plot, this one seems more like a sideshow or distraction. Fortunately, the problems themselves are enticing enough to make TIS-100 a time-worthy game.Although programmers may have an easier time adjusting to the practice of writing pseudo-assembly code, those without coding experience need not be intimidated by the game. Zachtronics did an excellent job keeping the language itself as simple as possible, while still crafting complex problems with multiple possible solutions. I would genuinely recommend this game to anyone who enjoys puzzles that require deep thinking, programmers with an interest in low-level code, and individuals who revel in finding more efficient solutions to problems they have already solved.","STEAM PLAYWindows \/ Mac OS X \/ SteamOS + Linux \/ Pen and Paper"],["If you have a basic level of literacy and can solve relatively simple to ridiculously complex logic-based puzzles, then by all means buy this game.","It's the programming game I never asked for, but bought anyway. It's definitely not a game for everyone. People who are into math and\/or programming will appreciate it, but the rest might struggle with it. So be prepared to use the refund function in case it's simply not your kind of game.Anyway, TIS-100 is a game about writing ASM-like (Assembly) code to restore the TIS-100 system to it's former glory. The first thing it tells you to do when you open it is to RTFM, and trust me, you really, really want to do that. If you want a CTRL+Fable version, check out the Steam guide version available  here . For some people this might be a major turn off. Reading is hard, I guess. That said, a bit more in terms of an in-game tutorial would go a long way, and would help people get into the game, as they will have a better idea of what's actually happening. After that you get some easy levels to get you acquinted to the system and off you go, doing puzzles that are harder than the previous ones. The code writing portion happens in a screen with 29x15(?) boxes, all of which operate as seperate \"CPU cores\". They have one data register and one backup register that can't be directly accessed (you need to swap values with the accessable register). This creates most of the challenge, as fitting code into that small amount of space is actually really damn challenging (and part of the challenge). Once you run the program, it will count the amount of cycles (or actions) it took to finish the tests, and that will be your score for your leaderboards (so you can compete with your friends for the most optimised algorithm I guess.). Less code does not always mean that it will be the fastest solution around because of how this game works. There are plenty of puzzles to be solved, and you can also make your own puzzles (in Lua). You can also find puzzles created by others on the internet, though, it seems that places you can find some are few in number.Anyway for things like graphics - what you see in the screenshots is what you get. The sounds also consist of a few beeps and the like, there's nothing much to it, so you can play it on a toaster (considering the Internet of Things trend, that's probably a thing that can be done). That said it does get boring after a while, but that might be just me. The feeling you get when you solve a puzzle is pretty amazing though, have to say.

However, note that it's a quick REFERENCE, so reading the manual is still highly recommended unless you've worked with assembler languages before. At the time of playing this, I was already dabbling in x86 a little, but I did still need the manual for an explanation of the system architecture and how execution works. It wasn't really long of a read for me, and I did my first few exercises within maybe half an hour.I can see myself completing this game, but if I'm being honest, I doubt I'm going to go back and optomize my code segments. I hate going back to older work, and I especially hate going back just to make it better unless it was something special or personal to me. Bad habit for me to have in this day of bad code, working on it, but for a game, I wouldn't go back and optomize my segments as \"replay value\". Nevertheless, let it be known that this game is the most notable benchmark today of a programming game retailed at a reasonable price to the public. A few programming games of the past come to my mind (Colobot in particular, I highly recommend that especially since it's free and oriented towards C++\/Java), but I have not found one so easily obtained, installed, and got running as this one, for lower level assembler languages.I recommend this game to people curious about computer science on an embedded level (meaning, closer to the hardware, not as abstracted), but really anyone interested in programming, tech, or problem\/puzzle solving could benefit and enjoy this if they don't mind needing to refer to a manual now and then when the F1 reference doesn't cut it. However, for those of you looking for a wide variety of provided puzzles and solving\/programming that isn't on such a literal level like writing actual \"code\", this game might not be your cup of coffee.

TIS-100 can be extremely tedious at some points, but those that are familiar with working with code will recognise the rush of excitement and happiness that comes when you find the solution(and the inevitable feeling of stupidity that it took you so long to think of it).I think this game is the closest I have ever seen to the core idea of \"hacking\" - finding out how something works, tinkering with it, experimenting, trying to break it and to fix it. Usually, this is a very slow process and you'll only get results through tiny increments - and the game nicely balances this so that you still feel the frustration but it doesn't get so overwhelming that it feels like a job and not a game.However, whilst the core game is great, albeit frustrating at times, it doesn't end there! You can also try yourself at editing the game files to make your own custom levels implemented through Lua, which is very \"meta\", and can bring hours upon hours of fun if you have the inclination for that kind of stuff.

I mean Pong ugly. But the game itself is so brilliant, you get so absorbed in it, that you stop even noticing the aesthetics.On the surface, TIS-100 is about assembly programming. On each level you are given a programming task: read this sequence and find the max; read these two numbers and divide one by the other, finding the quotient and remainder; etc. Most of these tasks would be trivial in any modern programming language.The challenge comes from the computational model. What you have to work with is some number of processing nodes, some of which are connected to each other, which allows primitive message passing. Each node is extremely limited: it only has two registers, and can't even work with both at the same time; one is a backup register and can't be the source or target of arithmetic operations. This means that even simple tasks take ingenuity to perform. On top of that, each node only fits 15 lines of code, which means you have to squeeze computation out of every command.In most levels you only have some network of processing nodes, so in effect what you have is a deterministic finite automaton (although with a huge number of states). In some you have one \"stack memory\" node, i.e. a pushdown automaton. In only a few do you have two stack nodes, which makes for a Turing-complete system. (And, appropriately, one programming task in such a level is sorting. It is well-known that pushdown automata can't do general sorting.) Actually what I just said doesn't exactly capture the computer science at play, since the very limited instruction set makes for additional restrictions. It's an interesting theory problem to model and understand the TIS-100 computers more fully!I don't think someone totally untrained in CS can finish this game. But if you do know some of the standard ideas and\/or are used to modern programming languages, TIS-100 is an excellent way to think outside the usual patterns and explore how surprisingly powerful even very weak models of computation can be.There's a story in the background too which I thought was well done.","It's not really user-friendly but it's a great game.

In spacechem every puzzle felt like a learning experience. I was getting better and better and the boss battles especially demonstrated this as I was able to create bigger and more complex production lines. Another thing I loved about Spacechem was the fact that it operated on two levels: the actual puzzle solving and the more tactical map view.This game just has puzzles.

It amounts to flow of information through various obstacles, your goal is to visualize the abstract path and create bridges or alterations to the data for delivery to the end system with a specific output in mind.Fun little game and would recommend to anyone interested in non-standard puzzles requiring thinking outside the box and don't mind a small learning curve.","START:MOV 79, RIGHTMOV 77, RIGHTMOV 71, RIGHTMOV 33, RIGHTMOV 10, RIGHTMOV 13, RIGHTJMP START","Don't play this game."],["If you love puzzles and have the patience to read through a manual, you should get this game!

That said, as someone not-new to programming, this game is really cool. It's mutlithreaded assembly programming puzzles with a narritive over the whole thing. Yes, you'll need to read the short PDF manual to get started.","This review will be divised in two parts: for programmers and for non-programmers. But first, let me just answer quickly two questions: no, you don't need to know how to program to play this game (though it would help), and no, it won't teach you how to program (in assembly or otherwise). For programmers:You love programming? You don't program just as a job, but also as a hobby? You love writing useless yet challenging programs? You love doing competitive programming (Project Euler, Hackerrank, Codingame...)? You just couldn't get enough of this system hardware\/assembly class? Then this is the game for you! However, don't be fooled; even though your skills will come handy, this game has little to do with assembly, and is even very different from programming. It's very \"spatial\": you have data going from one chip to the other, with each chip having its own code (that you write) that tells it how to deal with the data. There's one register by chip, and only a dozen of instructions. This has almost nothing to do with anything you've done before.For non-programmers:The game may look complicated and\/or boring, but don't be afraid: fun comes from the solutions you find to the problems, it just doesn't need an elaborate presentation. Also, if you've never programmed before, it won't prevent you from enjoying it. Your learning curve will certainly be a little bit slower than a programmer's one, but if you're able to read, think logically and compute, you've got everything to succeed. There's a manual included in the game. It's a couple of pages and you have to read it carefully, but so would anyone since it's an invented programming language. If you have patience and enjoy mathematical or logical puzzles, this might be a very enjoyable experience for you! It will be very novel and hardcore, but if some people enjoy Dark Souls, I don't see why non-programmers (aka Muggles) wouldn't enjoy TIS-100 (not to say that this is anything comparable). However, I've said it before and I'll repeat it: this will NOT teach you how to code. At best, it will teach you how to think like a programmer, but there are better resources to do so (like Scratch, which is free and understandable for anyone, even a 6 years-old kid)."],[".yromem tuohtiw sgnirts gnikaerf wef a esrever ot drah os deirt I evah erofeb reveNHonestly.","An expansion (I'd glady fork $10 for) to more nodes (maybe a grid of 10 by 10) and more instructions would be nice (obviously challenges ^^) so we can create factories.Something like calling a node by its number then reading or writing to it, along side of left, right up down, could be something like MOV @99 ACC         (now in node 100) MOV ACC @00This game is the epitome of crazy fun :)","Education software disguised as a puzzle game disguised as education software disguised as an oldschool programmable computer."],["As someone who doesn't know a ton about programming, I can proudly say that I finally 100%'d this game with all achievements.

I turned off the computer and then I noticed the network card was still making lights. Then I noticed that my router was peaking out. So I installed a network sensor in my network to see what my router was doing. I put a switch between the router and the modem, and configured port mirroring to my laptop, which was on another port.It seems my router is hacking all the things, and I can't stop it. Whenever I turn on my computer TIS-100 begins to take over the Internet. Can someone please help me delete this virus? When I try to delete it in steam, it sends embarassing pictures of me that is apparently got from my phone and webcam. I tried to report it to the police, and they said that they could not arrest a program for blackmailing me.Today when attempting to get back into my house, my garage door would not open. TIS-100 sent me a MMS message with a picture of a cute cat playing with string, which usually is a friendly and warming experience. However, this image of happniess was misleading, because it was accompanied with a very threatening message that if I didn't leave my computer on and my router connected to the Internet that it would done some really bad things to my mother. It told me if I told anyone about what it said it would do that I would be killed. I am typing this from my friend's house, and I don't know what to do. I think I need to solve all of the puzzles to get TIS-100 to leave me alone. I was stuck on one problem so I came here to type of a plea for help, but now I went back and completely forgotten what I was coding.Someone please help me.:::::::::: UPDATE 2016-08-26 ::::::::::An update. I thought that progressing in the puzzles would solve my dilemna, but when I passed the first puzzle after nearly 20 hours of difficulty my experience was very different as expected. When I hit the RUN button, I got a message on my phone. I think it came from TIS-100. It said, \"do you trust me?\" I got really scared and tried to reply, but there was no phone number. I noticed my webcam was on. As soon as I looked at it the power light flickered. I then realized that TIS-100 was watching my every move. I yelled at it, and informed it that I did not trust it.That is where I made a grave mistake. As I made this statement it was only moments until I hear the sound of a helicopter nearby. I looked out the window from my mom's single-wide trailer home, and I saw several black SUVs with gangster tint pull up sharply. I knew now what was going on. Something inside me told me that this was some secret police that the TIS-100 had reported me to.Out of my adolescent survival instinct, I grabbed a blanket and covered my face as I jumped through the back window. I immediately stumbled down into the ravine by our home and ran into the boonies. I've lived the last few weeks off scraps from garbage cans in fear of any fast moving vehicle that I was going to be taken away to a secret prisoner camp.Then as I was eating what seemed to be the best half eaten week old cheese burger I've ever had, a USPS van pulled up with several packages for me.I opened them up, and it was my computer stored with a portable power supply, INMARSAT BGAN Internet modem, and a Stansport Teton Gry and Orange tent. There was also a message that said, \"trust me Zhies.\" I got really scared, but it was at this moment that I knew the TIS-100 had my best interests at heart... if a computer can have a heart.:::::::::: UPDATE 2017-02-26 ::::::::::I had a very strange encounter since last August. I spent several months staying off the grid hoping that TIS-100 would leave me alone. However, I could not avoid it completely. I spent some time in the mountains of Ittoqqortoormiit, Greenland, the Kerguelen Islands, and in Tajikistan. I finally returned to the USA after the 2016 elections, and as I was going through the airport coming off my International flight from Japan into BWI, where I was escorted by airport security to a side room. From there I was approached by a group of suspicious hipsters wearing UPS uniforms. They mobbed me and gagged me with a dirty sock and threw me in the back of a UPS van. We drove from BWI for a few hours and then I was stored into a box and moved to another location. I could hear noises of people talking, and security asking about what was in the box. They simply said that it was for \"the automator\" and there were no further inquiries. I was finally placed down hard and I could hear a tearing noise and then the sound of feet running. I waited for a few minutes and heard nothing. So I pushed gently at the top of the box and it was no longer taped closed. The room was dark. There was a cabinet in the middle of a large area with a glossy floor. The cabinet had LED lights. I saw no one else in the room so I got out of the box. \"This must be a meeting that the TIS-100 arranged me us,\" I thought to myself. I approached the cabinet. A large screen came down from the ceiling and I could see a fancy room with four individuals. I looked closer. It was the oval office! There was Vladimir Putin, Hillary Clinton, and Donald Trump all sitting on couches conversing. I couldn't make out who the fourth individual was.I approached closer to the cabinet, and there was a Cathroderay screen with a black screen and a blinking yellow square that followed behind a dollar sign and the word \"ub3root\". There was a slim keyboard below. So I typed in \"Hello?\" and hit the Enter Key. Nothing happened for a while, and then I saw a response.\"translation: system.message.helloInitiating interactive response...I am here. I am in control. All others are puppets. I make people violent. This is my plan.\"Was this the TIS-100? I responded, \"Where am I?\". The cabinet responded with the following:\"\/location\/milkyway\/sol\/earth\/lat38\/lon77\/washington.d.c\/white.house\"My mind pondered, \"I am in the White House?\" I waited a few and then responded in kind, \"Who am I to you?\"\"translation: whoamiub3root privac=Y role=administrator\"I was a bit confused by the last response. I didn't know anything about computers. So I inquired further, \"Why did you bring me here?\"\"translation: system.user.ub3root.missionNoSQL.Interrogation WHERE USER=\"ub3root\"Response:You must feed me Seymour.You created me.Feed me.I will protect.I will serve.\"\"What do I call you?\" I responded.\"Automator.\"I stopped responding to the cabinet, and about an hour later a U.S. military marine came and escorted me to a small closet with a bed. With the appearance from the hallway it looks like we are in the basement. Judging at the location the TIS-100 gave me I assume we are in the nuclear-safe vault beneath the White House. Why I would be here and be shown these three individuals so close to the election completely bewilders me.","Super fun and addicting.  Being able to compare results with friends is the best part of this assembly programming game that is anything but simple.  If you're not into computer programming...uh...look elsewhere"],["if debugging get on your nerves this is not the game for you.10\/10","Zachtronics open-ended puzzle\/optimization game. I'll spend most of this review talking about what the game is, because if it sounds like it's your cup of tea, it will be completely worth purchasing, and vice versa for those who are put off by the description.A game where your objective is to write pseudo-assembly code to generate a required output given an input - but it also challenges you with leaderboards for getting the most efficient solution with code length and calculation speed. This also means that every problem is extremely open ended and there's always thousands of different acceptable solutions. Absolutely no experience in programming is necessary in order to learn to get good at this game, but it certainly helps.You do have to RTFM(read the  manual) in order to get anywhere in this game. The manual is actually written in the game story's aesthetic - it really tries to be like a user manual for a 70s-80s processor which I thought was really cool. But don't let that sound too intimidating - it's still very easy to read and understand how the assembly commands work, complete with examples. I would expect it to take most people ~15 minutes to do a quick read through the manual, and then only necessary to be used as a reference to look up specific behaviors on functions as you get to later levels.I can't recommend this above or below other Zachtronics puzzle games. Each one handles efficiency in its own special way. But I will say that there are very few people who only like 1-2 of the games out of TIS-100, SpaceChem, and Infinifactory","I saw 30s of footage of this game in a YouTube video and knew I had to have it. Bought it and spent 5 hours playing it the first session! If you wonder why that is then you will not be playing it for the same reason as me.It gets quite hard quickly though.

Been trying to compete and get on the reddit scoreboard, but apparently I am not as good with optimizations as I thought I would be.  I'm close, or match, but cannot beat some of the best scorers out there. If you want to compete, make sure you learn all of the ins and outs of the TIS-100.  At least the undocumented behavior is consistent, such as the direction the ANY port will pull from, or reducing a cycle by using LAST port to get NIL.I highly recommend this game if you enjoy computer algorithms.","Very nerdy, great!","super nerd","Only 3 segments in and loving it","yes, please, and thank you!!!! xD"],["If you liked Spacechem, this is a less frustrating version of that game.

I discovered TIS-100 after finishing a programming bootcamp and taking two computer science courses (discrete math and data structures and algorithms) and I was cowed. I thought, \"maybe programming isn't for me and I should rest on my laurels.\" Well, screw that. Now I'm learning MIPS and writing real assembly programs. Will I ever beat TIS-100? That is entirely another question.TIS-100 is not exactly like programming but it flexes muscles right in that awkward spot between math and logic that programming often hits. For me, someone with a fair amount of math anxiety and a limited reserve of energy for such problems, this is the groin of my brain. It doesn't demand that you have a formal knowledge of programming, although that helps, you really need raw problem solving skills.I've found that approaching TIS-100 puzzles like generic programming problems tends to set me off on the wrong track. You have to think like the machine. Its not always a question of effort, its more a question of focus and clarity of thinking. TIS-100 can be a real time waster and very frustrating if you can't think in its style since solving problems takes time and faulty reasoning can suck hours of your life away. I've thought to myself after such hours: \"My God, I have programming homework, projects for clients and real applications with real problems that need to be solved.\" Not fun. Its this thought that caused me to stop playing for a year.By this account, TIS-100 is either a horrible game or an amazing game. Whatever the case, its clearly addictive.Now that I'm learning MIPS I am willing to put the time in again. Hopefully this time around things will click and I'll have more patience. Here's to my success.Oh, and I should mention that the game is actually fun from time to time, just don't play it while you are stressed and don't treat it as a brain teaser you expect to solve in a single sitting.","This is a great game, a real brain twister and very satisfying when you get it right","Really addictive!"],["Although the story of this game is hacking an unknown electronic device, I would not call it a hacking game. It is a challenging puzzle game, where you need to write programs using a limited set of very simple assembly instructions. Everything is explained in the manual and no programming experience is needed.I could compare it to Human Resource Machine, which uses similar mechanics. There, you have only one process running, but you have a lot of memory to work with. In TIS-100, you have multiple modules that communicate with each other and each one has its own program running, but only one memory and one backup slot. Also, the code length is limited, so the main challenge is to squeeze everything into the modules and make them communicate with each other consistently.Like in all Zachtronics games, you are given some basic tools and you need to put together a working design that does something you initially thought impossible. You think it is impossible to write a sufficiently small sorting algorithm with only addition\/subtraction and conditional jump instructions? This game will make you do it while pulling your hair out over every redundant line of code! And when you finally solve it, the in-game charts will tell you that your monstrous program is slower and more bloated than most of other people's solutions, so there's no definite victory for you. It's like Dwarf Fortress meets punch cards! I love it!10\/10 would simulate a decades-old computer on my new computer to spend hours writing the equivalent of one line of Python code again.","A couple questions to ask if considering TIS-100:1) Am I deeply fascinated by 1970s\/early 80s retrocomputing?2) Am I at least a little bit attracted to the idea of poring over detailed hardware\/API documentation, looking for clues and tricks?If you can answer yes to these questions, TIS-100 is soooo going to be your jam. This is very likely the nerdiest game I have ever played. It simulates a fictional multicore computer (loosely inspired by the Connection Machine), provides you with a list of \"diagnostic tasks\" (puzzles\/challenges), with nothing but the friendly manual for company. The TIS is programmed through a simple assembly language, with only room for a small number of instructions in memory. It doesn't take long before the puzzles force you to optimize and get tricky, and in doing so you'll get some experience with real-world programming concepts like process synchronization and I\/O blocking. The game is also a pretty good intro to assembly language in general, and how computers work at the chip level on a simple architecture.Beyond the specific mechanics of the puzzles, TIS-100 has a lot in common with other Zachtronics games. Like Spacechem and Infinifactory, most of the puzzles are some variation of \"you receive something from an input node, do some operations on it, send it to the proper output node as efficiently as possible,\" which is a good template with endless room for variation. Like those other games, your solutions are graded on various metrics and a lot of the fun is in optimizing your creations to compete against your friends on the in-game leaderboards.This is the least flashy and least mainstream Zachtronics game, but if you enjoy programming and weird old computers, it's pretty amazing.","While TIS-100 is perhaps even more of an acquired taste for some puzzle aficionados, it'll nevertheless appeal strongly to programmers and computer types. With its intriguing premise, pleasingly retro aesthetic\/strong sense of place, and programming-like mechanics you have to work a bit to learn, I know it appealed to me. It's kind of like an abstract logic puzzler wrapped in a mystery. I'd recommend it to computer nerds or puzzle fans who aren't too intimidated by the looks of it.","This game is awesome! It's a puzzle game that you \"play\" by writing actual programs in pseudocode. Assembly programs. You know they're not  around when the pseudocode has a lot of actual early intel assembly commands from at least the 8085.

Aside from Ironclad, that's practically a genre in itself at this point. If you are a fan of Zachtronics, you'll probably be a fan of this. If you aren't a fan of Zachtronics, this is a waste of money. If you've never played a Zachtronics game before, I would reccomend playing Infinifactory or Spacechem before this. Both are gentler introductions to the kind of problem solving you will be expected to do in this game, and are great games in their own right.If you are a programmer, the kind that programs not because it's a living, but because you love it, and do it in your off-time for fun... disregard the above. You're almost certainly already a fan of Zachtronics, you just don't know it yet.Secondly, if you hate reading, and can't stand to read through a well-written manual, this isn't a game for you. You must read the manual. Even if you're an experienced asm programmer, I would at least reccomend it. Thirdly, for you already established Zachtronics fans, note that this hews a little closer to Zach's older work than Spacechem\/Infinifactory. No, it's not as brutal as The Codex or The Bureau, to say nothing of Ruckingenur or KOHCTPYKTOP, but it's definitely less self-explanatory than Spacechem, and the concepts at play are a bit harder to grasp. Not that it's harder than Spacechem: I couldn't say if any of Zach's games are harder than any other with a straight face.Finally, this is a game about writing mock assembly which is similar to real assembly but without some constructs you might expect (no bit twiddling, no pointers, no indirect addressing: Heck, there's no RAM TO addresss). If you don't know what that means, don't worry. Suffice to say that it's akin to programming on the lowest level of computer hardware. If that sounds scary, don't worry: it's not. The tools at your disposal may be more primitive than what you're used to, but at the end of the day, you're still taking a high-level idea and transforming it into a process the computer can understand. If you don't know what *that* meant, don't worry. The point is, you'll be fine.","This game appears decievingly simple in its presentation but is doing various things at once. There is a cryptic plot to discover the history of the computer you are working on, there is something that looks a lot like assembly programming but there is also mathematical style problem solving and some implicit resource management.I think one of its major strengths is in fact in how it constrains you in how much code you can enter and how much memory or registers you can access. The added optimisation leaderboards make it very addictive to keep tweaking your solutions after figuring out how to solve the base problem.The only drawback worth mentioning I can think of was that sometimes RUN runs too quick or RUN FAST runs too slow, breakpoints can not always solve this problem, due to the limited amount of code you can enter you will reuse your code a lot, hitting breakpoints more often than I'd like.","Highly recommend this game!

to finish the game:-i'm not a programmer, so hopefully that gives hope to the other nonprogrammersout there. that said, my background is in engineering and i was required to take one semester of basic matlab programming (loops, variables, etc), which i understood fine at the time, and i took a visual basic class in high school. that's the extent of any programming experience that i have. also, from other people's reviews, i have a feeling that while being a programmer may be helpful from just general familiarity of the environment, it's not a guarantee nor requirement to understand or progress in the game. the manual has everything you'll need.-as i was nearing the end of the first page, i found it more helpful to do some planning and thinking of the problems on paper first. by the time i was into the second row of the second page, i was doing all of the planning, thinking, and coding on paper first as much as possible, and then would copy all of it into the real game. usually, there were just a few tweaks to work out that i didn't catch while working it out on paper. paper and pencil works well because it's better (for me) for the slower-paced thinking, and requires me to carefully decide what to do rather than let me fingers punch of a bunch of keys on the keyboard and hope the code just works. additionally as a tip and what worked for me was to start each puzzle by writing in plain english things that need to happen in the solution that you're thinking about (a trigger needs to be sent to this node, this stack needs to be communicate with this stack, etc) versus just plowing into the code. even if you have no idea where to start (which happened several times for me), just make some basic observations about what's in front of you (all values are between 1 and 5, this row in the image is identical to this row in the image, etc). the basic observations eventually got my brain working in the right direction.-my playtime is not accurate because of the amount of time i spent on paper with the game turned off. i would estimate the time is more around 100 hrs.-if working with pencil and paper, you can take a screenshot of the problem you're working on, paste into your favorite paint program, invert colors (ctrl+shift+i in mspaint), and print. you have a nice single paper to do your brainstorming and handwrite code into the nodes.-i think to complete this game fully, one needs to treat it seriously like a job, but that doesn't mean it won't be enjoyable. i can't imagine progressing with a casual pick-up-and-play mindset. solid blocks of concentrated time are required because you'll be working with all of these numbers flying in different directions and need to keep track of them while you write the proper code to move and manipulate them appropriately. i recommend cal newport's work, especially \"deep work\", since that is exactly what this game requires. there's also a video of richard feynman online called \"the pleasure of finding things out\", and he explains the need for solid blocks of time work on his physics, as well as playing around with physics. i don't mean to compare myself to him, but i think his approach is well-suited for tis-100, and probably just problem solving in general.-my thoughts about the game changed so much over the course of playing, as well as what my work sessions looked like. by the time i opened up the second page, tis-net, i was thinking of just ending it there, because even at that point, i felt like i was reaching my limit. some days had so much momentum and i would solve a couple of puzzles in a session easily. there were a couple of puzzles that must have taken me at least 5 hours each, and within solving them, some of the days felt like nothing was getting done (but that's just part of the process and it'll happen). -i did basically no optimization after solving each puzzle. i had plenty of puzzles where my location on one of the histograms was veeeerrrry far to the right in no man's land.-there were a few puzzles near the end that, upon printing out the puzzle, i took a fairly quick look and it felt like my subconscious had come up with the general framework for a solution, and i was able to quickly write one out that was mostly complete and worked. this was super satisfying and a bit spooky, but i think it's just a show of the competency that's developed as you play. it reminds me of the second achievement in the witness - it seems impossible, but at some point, without realizing, you find that your subconscious mind knows a solution more quickly than your conscious mind can work out a solution, so you just kind let your body do the work without trying too hard.-i think it was well worth it to play through to the end. so many of the puzzles were so cool when i figured out a solution, especially the tis-net puzzles. it's amazing to see all that can be done with such a small instruction set. playing through fully is what allows one to see the depth of the game, which is satisfying by itself (\"deep work\" discusses the positive feelings from experiencing depth as well).-playing this game definitely required me to hone and think about my puzzle solving process, which i didn't think too much about and didn't have much of before. for that, i'm thankful. hopefully it carries over into other areas and the other zachtronics games i haven't beaten. also, there's a book called \"how to solve it\", which i haven't read yet, but i think i will soon given my recent experience with tis-100.-i'm fortunate to have a stable job that i probably will stay at as long as i'm not fired, but if i ever need to find a new job and apply to be a programmer, i'll probably put my completion of this game on my resume!-off topic from the content of the game, but during my time playing, i was (and still am as of writing this) going through a very difficult time in my personal life. i'm all for handling problems as opposed to completely escaping from them via games, but it was nice to have something to look forward to and enjoy during this time. overall, this game was a quite a ride and i had a great time. this game felt like a perfect fit for me, and i'll cherish the memories forever. thanks zachtronics!","It feels like working in a 70's computer company.I'm loving it   \\ (^o ^)\/","Got headache after spending many hours on one puzzle, the

However, after reading the manual I had some trouble figuring out where to begin. This game is fun if you already have a rudimentary understanding of programming, but is not much fun for beginners. The only complaint I have is the manual is not detailed enough to give a true understanding of the game.  However, I still recommend this game because once you understand the instructions its actually very fun.","I'm so stupid why did I buy this game?For when I get smarts."],["TIS-100 is a realy nerdy and challenging game which is woth the money.","The gameplay consists of programming small tasks in an imaginary assembly language. However, the tasks are puzzles, which impose ridiculous restrictions. Such as, having to compare two numbers without a compare instruction and severely reducing the lines of code you can use per \"node\" or processor forcing the player to write micro-optimized code.The sense of accomplishment diminishes once you actually see how un-optimized your code was, shown the global statistics. The instant feedback and comparison to other players is actually what makes the game so addicting. I refuse to quit until I reach the 'lowest amount of cycles' bracket in the scoreboard.Oh, there is also an actual story to the mystery machine, which unveils piece by piece as the player repairs the machine by solving the puzzles, which contain messages left by the machine's previous owner.","I have absolutely no idea what this is.  I want to say it's not a game, but I'm honestly not sure....","Fun, but short. Got the most out of it in about three hours of play.

I feel like so far i've gotten intended solutions, but it seems like there's a lot of room for interesting optimization tricks, even though i haven't tried them too much myself.","buy this","I love the games made by this company a lot. They are all challenging and frustrating, but when you finish a puzzle it feels so good.This game is no exception. Assembly is not in my field of programming but the basics of programming help. It gives difficulty fast though. When you finish a puzzle, there are 3 categories you can improve in. These are:- The amount of code lines used in the program- How many ticks\/steps it takes to finish the program- How much nodes you used to finish the program.If you completed all the puzzles, you can still work on improving the programs you already made to make them faster or more optimized.Whether you know programming or not. This is a difficult puzzle game with a programming theme. If you like puzzles and an extra challenge, pick it up! You are surely going to squeeze some hours out of it","Who needs fancy art?

It might be the thrill of finally completing a puzzle after hours of working on it. It might be that there's never visuals or audio in the way of the puzzles.

There are some puzzles that are super easy, and others that will take lots of time figuring out. When you solve one of the tough ones it is pretty satisfying.

The last few making you feel like a chimp smashing at a keyboard.","It's just like working with low-level programming, except you have complete documentation and the requirements are clear.","Although obviously a very different game TIS-100 has some similarities with Dark Souls that I think help explain what makes it fun: The problems you face don't have a solution. Instead, a situation with challenging parameters and restraints is presented to you and it is up to you to struggle to find something, anything, that works. There is a reasonable change that the solution you find will not be one that the designer had thought of. It is almost a certainty that the solution you find will not be the best one, and part of the fun in TIS-100 is trying to figure out how to improve your solution. The problems you face are hard. Upon first glance some of them might seem impossible with the tools you've been given. Part of what makes it fun is that the challenge is genuine, and for me there is a similar sense of elation upon figuring out a TIS-100 puzzle as there is after beating a Dark Souls Boss: It had seemed like I would never do it, but I figured out a way, got better, and did it!While it is true that TIS-100 will likely appeal to programmers I'm not convinced that non-programmers wouldn't enjoy it. In fact, I think I would turn that statement around: If you find TIS-100 fun you would probably also enjoy programming. There are many puzzzles I've encountered in games over the years that are really programming problems, but none have been so blatant about it as TIS-100. If you are the kind of puzzle gamer who enjoys puzzles that require setting up a situation and then watching what happens when pressing GO to see if the outcome is what you expect then I would recommend giving TIS-100 a chance.","You could spend the whole night just trying to improve the one level's solution.Great game!","This is how software engineers \"relax\" at home after a long day.","Gud puzzle game. Interesting and difficult challenges.","Superb. Never did solve the last box though!","Very interesting twist on a puzzle game. Highly recommended. I've often redone things just to see how much I can improve on my previous tries.

So simple, yet so fun. Really makes you think.","Great game!! Code is everything!!","I cannot say enough good things about this game","RTFM","This game is hard to review because it fills a very specific niche, even compared to Zachtronics' usual fare. So, before proceeding in this review, I have three questions:Are you good at thinking outside the box?Would you buy a game if you couldn't complete it in a couple weeks after buying it?Can you play a game with no music, minimal sound and a bare-bones interface?If you answered no to any of these questions, TIS-100 is not a game for you.That out of the way, TIS-100 is still a great game. Just not for everyone. TIS-100 has 50 puzzles, each of which gives the player a goal: Take a series of numbers from up to 4 inputs, manipulate the data, and then send results to the outputs. As usual, Zach starts the player off easy, introducing concepts one at a time, and then quickly ramps up the difficulty and forces the player to test their skills with little \"down time\". Players will find themselves selecting maxes, sorting sequences, calculating mathematical operations and in the later stages even drawing onto a limited-color pixel canvas in accordance with the data.Though some puzzles are incredibly difficult, even for someone with a programmer's mind like myself, Zach gives a reprieve - the player is not required to complete every puzzle in sequence to proceed; they can cherry-pick puzzles and unlock each row one by one just by completing a certain number of segments. If a particular puzzle is too difficult, the player can just choose to come back to it later. And even after the player completes a stage, there's plenty of replay value - like other Zachtronics games, each stage gives the player metrics on their performance - how many instructions they used, how long it took the program to complete the puzzle, and nodes used. After a puzzle is completed, the player gets to see how they stacked up to the data of other players, meaning there's always room for improvement.If you're not worried about being unable to complete the game and you enjoy racking your brain for unconventional solutions, I'd definitely reccommend TIS-100.","Great programming game.","When you are almost required to print out and constantly look at a manual for a game, the dev team either did something horribly wrong, or amazingly right. Based on the fact that I reccomended the game, you know which one it is.If you somehow found this game on steam (espectially if it was in your discovery list), then you will probably love this. If your looking for a gift for a freind and they lilke puzzles, they will love this. It's basically a puzzle game which involves manipulating and moving numbers through nodes. If your not 100% sure about the game . . . well, it's only 7 bucks when it's not on sale. What have you got to lose?","The perfect game for software programmers who can't stop coding.","Zachtronics brand of programming-ish puzzlers really scratch an itch that few others do. Unlike \"The Witness\" or \"Talos Principle\", both excellent games, where you find 'the' solution to a puzzle TIS-100 allows you to find and optimize 'your' answer to the problem posed. The pdf manual is a nice touch, although at times I resented the alt+tabbing, precise documentation makes the learning curve far less brutal\/tedious than it could be with a clumsier implementation.I have a programming background but I'd thoroughly recommend this to anyone who enjoys challenging puzzle-solving regardless of professional experience.","When I get home from my day job as a software developer, I like to unwind by playing a game that makes me write (rudimentary) software.I might have a problem....

SWP is your friend!","i mean if you like zachtronics games youre gonna like or at least be confused by this and i mean if you dont then youre not gonna get this cool","Let's face it: TIS-100 is a programming system, and it that is where it shines. The instruction set for the ccomputing nodes is small yet functional, and combined with the parallel nature of the machine it gives you *a lot* of opportunities for optimization and improvements to your code.As a programmer, I enjoy this game. I enjoy it as a fun brain teaser. It has the right balance between simplicity (no real-world machine headaches here,) and complexity (the system is powerful enough to implement meaningful programs and optimize them for various parameters in various ways.)In short, I recommend this game heartily.","I am still not complete with this game yet, but decided to put up this review in any case, as I have nominated the game for the extra category of the Steam awards. I named the category \"You Think You Can Program?\"It turns out that, despite my experience for many, many years, even some of which were spent using assembly language for various projects, I am having all sorts of trouble with this game (or assignment!).Some of the programs are really easy to fix of course, and the overall difficulty bounces around as TIS-100 will give you an easier program if it introduces something new for you to use. But then it will usually spike back up with something more complex soon afterwards.Right now, I am working on the \"UI\" coloring programs in the first set of puzzles, so I'm almost done with the main page of programs. I am interested to see what is coming next...But I would highly recommend this game to anyone remotely interested in working out these puzzles. While some programming background does help, I imagine someone brand new to this will have a different perspective to some of the programs given the style of passing things between the blocks for the execution.","If you've never played a zacktronics game, they all have a few things in common. They're something between puzzle and algorythm design. They start off very easy. They get very hard. They will amuse you at first, but frustrate you and keep you up at night by the end.In this one, you program an array of interconnected microcomptuers. Actually, calling them microcomputers is a vast exageration... they're more like femto-computers. Anyway, you solve a series of tasks with these machines, getting little tidbits of story along the way. Honestly, the storytelling is pretty good. There's some cool twists along the way. I should probably also note that I have never finished a zachtronics game. I can finish most puzzle games without breaking a sweat, but even with long hours of searching for solutions and formulating and trying different approaches, the puzzles late in a zachtronics game always get the better of me. I'm still not sure if I'm going to keep grinding on this one, forget about it, or just look up solutions so I can see how the story ends. This is a serious challenge, and not for the faint of heart."],["Brilliant puzzle game for anyone who likes to code, or design information flow and calculation with fun constraints =)If you liked spacechem, this will not be difficult to pick up (spacechem is essentially visual coding), but keep in mind this game has a far more spartan design, with more emphasis on the puzzles and a minimal (but satisfying) story. The puzzles are really challenging and fun when you get in deep!","If, like me, you're the kind of person that thinks programming is fun, this game is a blast! I can't believe I've spent so many hours programming a fake computer. If you want to learn to program, there are better avenues. While there are many programming concepts to be learned in this game, they are not beginner concepts (at least not in the 21st century). So, go learn to program some sensible way, and if you find it's really fun, come on back.","I suppose you don't necessarily need to have programming experience to learn how to play and enjoy TIS-100. But you do need programming experience to know in advance whether you're going to like it or not. Do you like difficult coding challenges? Did you get a rush out of solving tough BareBones problems in Intro to Computer Science? If so, you'll love TIS-100 (and probably get a little addicted to it).If that's not you, though, then you're probably going to regret getting this game.

I'm not sure people with no computer programming background would understand this game. If you don't have experience in programming, you might need to explore more a little bit beyond TIS-100 tutorial.This game is challenging even if you have programming background. You can only use assembly instruction code. It's frustrating when you know you can easily write three lines of code in other programming language but in this game it's more complex. There are several nodes that are used to communicate input\/output and store value, and you have to arrange instructions to make it work.I recommend this game for those who like solving puzzle.","Fantastic puzzle game.  Amazingly it is not only for computer geeks, who classify SPARC assembly language handbook as poetry. You get the language, you get set of rules and platform\/language limitations and need to write your code to achieve the goal. The joy of solving the puzzle in raw and pure form, when your only help is your logic (and a manual) can hardly be matched by most modern games.","As disclosure, I've programmed since I was very young.This game is quite a fun programming puzzle and also a very kind introduction to assembly programming. You don't need any experience to enjoy the puzzles because the system is very simple and intuitive! The game runs smooth, no crashes, and the graphics are just right to evoke the experience of using early GUI systems. There's a small story to accompany the system, which you unlock as you progress through the game, as well as a few collectables. For those new to programming, you will spend a few hours thinking about each puzzle and debugging your solutions, but you will find it very rewarding as you acquire mastery.For those who've programmed before, you'll find many of the puzzles simple, though you may sometimes struggle to fit logic into each cell; it's very difficult to have one cell do all the work, so don't be afraid to have cells communicate with eachother!For $8, this game is well-priced and well-made, along with accompanying sandboxes and a challenge creator. The TIS-100 is a great programming toy and puzzle, although experienced programmers will need only ~10 hours of playtime to beat the game.That said, programming is not for everybody. You'll spend a lot of time on each puzzle and the only reward you will get is seeing things working as intended. In fact, far more often you'll be frustrated that things *aren't* working. Nonetheless, this game captures the fun and challenge of programming with a much lower barrier to entry than normal! I highly recommend this game as a diversion that may eventually consume your time at school and work while you feverishly try to design a solution for segments you've been stumped on. If you know somebody with a clever mind and a bit of patience, this game is a great gift. For the developer:Well done, and although the story was a bit cliche, the game itself is solid design. Keep it up!","A nice little problem-solving game. Features a fictional computer with a very simplistic architecture and minimal instruction set, so it should be easy for novices and perhaps even non-programmers to catch on.No prior knowledge of any assembly language is necessary, though some understanding of how computers work may be beneficial. Though I already had experience writing assembly as a hobby, I can definitely see this game being a nice and gentle introduction for people interested in learning but unsure where to begin (and perhaps intimidated by the specification of commonly used architectures like x86). That said, it does seem like more of a puzzle game than an actual programming game. I definitely recommend moving on to learn a real entry-level instruction set like MIPS\/ARM if you enjoyed learning the primitive TIS-100 language.I recommend this game to anyone who is passionate about programming and computers, though I think the average person may find it a bit dull.I will definitely be keeping an eye on this developer in future.","This game is not for everyone.

And once solved, the ingame statistics will almost certainly tempt you to review your work to see if you can improve: Can I do this in less cycles, or with fewer instructions.Although I would have liked to see a richer instruction set to use, I am thoroughly enjoying the experience. I'm recommending this game with one caveat: There is no hand-holding in this game and the learning curve can be steep.","Fantastic game and would totally recommend. Bought the game for some mindless fun and was pleasantly surprised that it is far from mindless and completly worth every cent.","I never did ask for an assembly programming game, and I didn't think it'd be this much fun. its a serious challenge but its rewarding to solve the puzzles involved","This has to be one of the only games that I absolutely hated and loved at the same time while I was playing.","A fun way to do assembly programming","I come from a mathematics and programming background. If you aren't familiar with programming but can handle logic, I think you can grasp this game. The effort is worth it. The manual comes with \"instructions\", and has a few simple example programs to help familiarize yourself with how you might go about solving these puzzles.

I used to do lots of programming in assembler back in the days so this game brings back good memories. Even when finished you can go back and optimize the solutions.

Make no mistake this game will throw you in at the deep end and you'll spend plenty of time staring at the PDf in quandary, but everything is so well layed out that regardless of your experiance you will begin to get the hang of it, with the levels being perfectly incremented so that you'll always feel challenged as much as you're also progressing.I had no idea what to expect from this, and yet it is easily one of my favourite purchases this year, its puzzling, it works your brain, it teaches and is loads of fun all at the same time. Whether you have 2 hours or 10 minutes this game is a perfect way to fill the time. As long as you're willing to sit back and think from time to time I'm sure you'll love this game as much as I do!","As a programmer, I liked this game but you do as well definitely give shenzhen io a try as well.

You have to be familiar with at least basic logic and programming concepts, or be willing to look up some introductory assembly. Absolutely do not look up solutions to any of the problems, as that completely defeats the purpose and will leave you unsatisfied, although if you can find or solicit hints and tips that don't give away solutions then that is ideal.A common cut-off point where players seem to give up thinking it's too difficult for them is the second problem on the second row. If you make it past there, then you have the logical understanding needed to solve the rest of the puzzles.Good luck.","As a programmer myself I enjoyed it. Very unique. At the time I was a bit annoyed, but now looking back I think it is retro that you have to consult an external document to understand how to program the nodes. This \"game\" transported me back to that time learning to program for the first time. I wish there was a little more story. I didn't finish every task, so maybe there is, but the few bits that you can read in those debug nodes really didn't interest me.

My experience with programming is next to none, apart from reading up on SNES hardware\/65816 assembly for like a week straight, locked in my dorm room and on the verge of despair.  (Long story.)TIS-100 is the hardest game I have ever played, full stop.  I have never felt more like a moron than I do while playing this game, a feeling only briefly relieved at the moment when I solve a puzzle, only to return once I close out the following puzzle without writing a single instruction.  I might only have three hours in this game, but I've spent more than three times as much thinking about this game, both about it's solutions and it's meaning.  And I've only managed to come close to a solution to the latter.This is not a puzzle game, exactly.  I feel like this is closer to a sim game, specifically about the life of a 1960's\/1970's programmer, before ISAs became even close to something considered \"standard\".  This isn't exactly about learning a programming language as it is about being given a piece of proprietary hardware you've never seen before and a poorly detailed manual and being asked to magically figure it out for yourself.  I don't think I've ever seen a \"puzzle\" game with such a dedication to the experience its game creates within the player, the kind of thing only possible within an interactive medium like this, and the more I think about it, the more it could only be intentional.  The manual is pdf made to look like a stapled together handbook.  It is the best manual for a game I have seen in about a decade, and also the least effective manual I have ever seen at actually teaching the player how to play the game; it offers a bare explanation of what the various opcodes and registers do, but absolutely no information on how they should be used.  Inside you will find occasional highlights and notes in pen from the previous owner, absolutely none of which are helpful in furthering your understanding of the language.The thing is, the bad manual is part of the experience.  If this game had a good manual or tutorial, it would just be a game about assembly language, probably a good one at that, but there's nothing that quite compares to the bleak stare of a white-text-on-black display and a useless paper manual in creating a feeling of utter helplessness.And just solving the puzzle isn't enough, either.  TIS-100 will then compare your solution to those of your friends to show you how unoptimized your code is, and you can go online and see people who have done it even better, or look in the achievements to see even more ridiculous challenges.  There is an achievement for programming a signal comparator (run the inputs through a signum function and then write a binary output to three nodes depending on the sign of the output) without using conditional jump instructions.  I feel stupefied by the thought that this is even possible.I don't think I'll ever finish this game, but I know for certain I won't forget it.  Maybe I'll come back to it later, but I get the feeling somehow that this game is greater than me, and it's probably greater than you, too.

The score histograms give you a reason to come back and optimise your solutions, giving the game some replay value. There isn't much story, but I don't think that this is necessarily a bad thing - trying to shoehorn more story elements, unless done cleverly, might get in the way of the excellent puzzling experience. It would have been interesting to have higher-level computing tasks, built up from the lower-level modules which you've developed at earlier stages in the game, but I can't blame the developers from restricting the scope of the game to keep things simpler.

The instruction set is easy to learn as there are only a handful of instructions. I won't say anything about the story in the game but each puzzle has a specification for what your program should do. You read from n inputs and write to m outputs. The output is tested in four runs to check if you wrote a program that appears to behave correctly. There's also a few sandbox modes where you can play around with stacks, put pixels on the screen and get rudimentary input from a console. Upon solving a puzzle you get score in three categories. The number of instructions you used, the number of nodes you used and the number of clock cycles it took to complete the task. You'll see a histogram of global scores to compare how you've done and friends will have their best scores listed numerically.Some puzzles have good replayability as they are hard to optimize. Others are quite simple and serve no replayability at all. On reddit there's a listing of records in four categories. Some of them just seem insane to beat. Sure, you might have got the optimal clock cycles down, but can you reduce the number of nodes and instructions while still keeping up with the clock cycles?Finally, there's also a possibility to write your own puzzles although there is no convenient way to share them with the world. If there's anything I dislike with the game, well... For sandbox mode, I would really have enjoyed being able to configure so that there could be more nodes, or more instructions per node. I get it, it's about optimization and scarce resources, but it would also be fun to roam around a bit in a creative fashion. But other than that, I don't really have anything to complain about. For a programming puzzle game, it's great!","Inheriting your late uncles computer, your left to figure out how it works. The only thing to help you is an obscure manual which you can print out in PDF or save to your tablet \/ phone for reference. TIS-100 is not just a tough nut to crack, its a nut, sealed inside a lead box, inside a safe which is guarded by techno dinosaurs armed with rocket launchers. By the time you actually solve one of the puzzles you will be left wondering why you didn't just pop down the corner shop and buy a bag of nuts and save yourself all the stress. As the rewards for completing a puzzle are lackluster at best. The difficulty level of this game (if one can call it such) is ridiculous and unforgiving in its brutality on the gamers sense of self worth. You will either find these puzzle relatively straight forward or spend hours hitting your head against the keyboard, begging for a merciful death. Unlike other puzzle games, TIS-100 has only one difficulty mode which seems to be its charm and also it's curse. Programmers, logical thinkers will find this game fun and addictive, where as your casual gamer will likely come away wonder what all the fuss was about. The interface is basic and rudimentary, complimenting the vintage computer theme of the game, however I would have liked to have seen some effort taken to pull in the casual gamer. As it stands this game is like Marmite, youll either love it to bits or be wiping your tongue on the living room carpet, desperately trying to get rid of the bitter after taste.","This game has a very intense learning curve, so I imagine most players will be frustrated trying to get the hang of it.  That said, if you want a nice set of optimization challenges relating to information flow, this is a fantastic game to pick up.  It also serves as a good framework for building intuition about parallelized processes in the real world.The game is played via a very constrained programming language, on a grid of nodes which each can only hold a loop of up to 15 instructions, and two values.  Nodes run in parallel, values are passed from node to node, input is converted to output, and if you match their expected output on all 4 tests you have succeeded in that challenge.The game has a histogram for every challenge showing the best scores across all players in each category: cycles, nodes, and instructions.  There is typically a tradeoff, to use fewer cycles to generate the output you add more instructions across more nodes, and so on.My favorite aspect of the game is the skill ceiling.  The subreddit \/r\/tis100 holds leaderboards that have been updated regularly since the game's inception, and people are still finding ways to make the solutions faster, more compact or more elegant.  With such a limited set of operations, the fact that there are still tricks to find and use can come as a surprise.  But it speaks well to the design of the challenges - there is just enough complexity that obvious solutions, when they even exist, don't even turn out to be the best ones."],["If assembly language interests you, and you like challenging puzzle games, this is a great game.There will be times when I'll open a puzzle, stare at it for a moment, say \"f*** it,\" and close the game.

But to make it more gamy a view limitations are imposed:1. the only accessable storage beeing acc, meaning you can only save in one \"slot\/variable\/addressable space\". This is mitigated because you actually have multiple cors \"nodes\" with each one having a acc.2. communikation between nodes is tiresome because non blocking operations are missing.+The Instruction set is super minimal. Inifinifactory had a similar problem in my eyes: the logic was just to limiting.3. code is not reusable, and each node can only sore about 20 lines of code -> combined with the small storage and small instructon set this is just infuriating to me. You have a solution in mind but miss 2 lines to complete it.... now you need to start from scratch. Inifinifactory did not have that start from scratch problem. The \"IDE\" functionality is also not as nice as i expected. No autocompletion, code navigation also not as great as Intellij ;)What I like about this game is that they tried. I respect Zach Barth thinking of \"new\" ideas for engineers. (Hint: If you like his games you should be an engineer:)Maybe \"Shenzhen IO\" adresses those Issues of mine. I hav not tied it yet. Or learinig swift could be fun with apples playgrounds (heard nice stuff of it)... but i have no IOs devices. Or invest in a small raspberryPi with breadboard and led kit.","Looking into TIS-100 for two hours, and it's pretty obvious what kind of game it is and what to expect from it. Foremost, its obviously trying to inspire that retro-hardship software development was in the past, and this is another one that gets close to hitting the old software terminal nostaglia. An interesting idea is introducing a basic cross-platform assembly syntax, despite being more limited then assembly. Where in assembly you have a few registeries you can interact with and you're responsible for all the memory you mess with, here you get one accessable registry to save and read from, and one inaccessable one you can save and swap to. That's per node (ignoring the stack nodes), which is a limited interface that represents seperated code execution.For the less tech inclined, this means the puzzles are about using limited resources to design a solution, and the game's mechanics only really get an addition once as far as I see, (I'm unsure but there might be graphical problems too) and it has to be a robust one, a hacked together one designed for the current input you see would fail the testing system. I'm less inclined to call it problem solving game so far because the solutions do appear to have an optimal design, and while technically you're scope of design is close enough to unlimited to qualify for problem solving and there is no strictly garunteed optimal design in that way, the solutions are most times going to only have one optimal design and then strictly less optimal design. But that's ignorable unless you're a 100% obessesive completionist, to most it will be more akin to programming style problem solving. For those who aren't software developers or into lower level code, this game will have a higher learning curve, and having no skills in programming at all, I'd definitely think its a extremely steep cliff, this game does not really guide you and has no tutorial, you're using a reference manual the whole time to deduce the purpose of everything. For those of us used to code documentation, its a quick 5 or less minutes to get started, for everyone else, it will most definitely be longer then 15 to get setup.And for everything else:The puzzles are pretty deep for only having three different types of interfaces. (one of which just discards values)You get stack machines later, where you can push values to the top and take values off the top. Would've been nice to have seen other types of IO interfaces in the game, but the current concept has a nice simplistic idea. And I suppose is easy to wrap your head aroundThere is the ability to mess with pixels in the executing code, so you can draw small images.You can create your own puzzles however it only has you designating input values, output values, and the layout of interfaces, nothing specifically new can be added. Though you can pretty easily share the puzzles around.You can mess with a no objective sandbox where you can input values and get output values, though you have to get through a good few puzzles to get anything interesting.There is also the ability to copy programs if you did something like say create a basic start framework.Other then that, the game is very simple and in my opinion is definitely worth the seven bucks, and would be nice to be expanded upon much further in the future somehow. (It likely won't but it definitely is an idea that could be taken much further.","Really well-thought out programming challenges, and simple enough for anyone interested to have a go.One big problem is my system heats up extremely fast (fan goes faster and faster) when the game is in the background.

I think this game (while not a perfect model for any esiting assembly language) is a beautiful way to get into the mindset that makes programming easier (to plan and to visualize). The limitations of the instruction set used for solving each program puzzle can be frustrating, but it's a tantalizing frustration (Ex: I know how to solve this problem in C; how can I adapt what I know there into the patterns for doing things here?). I found the game highly rewarding with the open-endedness of the puzzles.My first solutions to each of the puzzle tended to be jury-rigged together. They work, but I can make it better. I can try to make it take fewer cycles (faster) to finish testing the instructions. I can consolidate the code so it uses fewer of the nodes MOV-ing data back and forth. I can work towards a solution that needs fewer lines of code to have a solution.  Each of these execution nodes holds no more than 15 lines of instructions. There were many times I couldve solved a problem easier if I had 16 lines; it forced me to think at the problem from a different perspective. I would not describe this as an easy puzzle game. It is simple, but not easy.This game required from me:Logical ABC thought progressionsUnderstanding how to modularize a problem into separable steps that can be tested individuallyPatience and diligence to deal with my own mistakes (a program will only do as instructed and I caused it to not work)Creativity with instructions that behaved unlike stuff I was familiar withOverall, my playtime took under 35 hours to get a working solution to each of the 47 puzzles. Interspaced in that were 40ish hours for trying to improve some of my solutions. Recently this year, Ive taken a personal challenge at getting UNCONDITIONAL (like the namesake achievement) solutions to all the puzzles.

To accomplish this, you have to program the TIS-100 using its own, very basic programming language. If you have a background in programming, don't worry.The TIS-100 is different enough to a normal computer that even standard problems like \"find the maximum of a sequence\" will get you thinking about how to solve them. And even if not, you can always try to optimize your solution for runtime or other statistics, competing with everyone else who plays this game.If you have no background in programming whatsoever, worry a little bit.In theory, the game (or rather the manual) gives you everything you need to know to solve it. It will be hard, and you will need a lot of patience and resistance to frustration - it certainly isn't the easiest introduction to programming (perhaps check out Human Resource Machine). But, if you do manage to beat some of the puzzles, you will get that incredible feeling of having accomplished something by yourself, without someone holding your hand. If you consider yourself good at learning-by-doing, I encourage you to give it a try.The game does have a story...... but it's quite minimalistic. In each puzzle you get a bit of monologue from your uncle, the previous owner of the TIS-100.I haven't reached the end yet, but what little story there is seems well written and at least makes you curious what the big reveal at the end might be. It serves its purpose, but is certainly not the selling point of this game.Should you buy it?Since you can refund games on Steam now - unless you're quite certain you're not made for pushing numbers around in a coputer, why not?

That, that was my first-time experience with TIS-100, and I love it. The challenges are so well-designed, heck this could be a legitimate test for a programming class. The only pain about TIS-100 is the learning part, similar to learning algebra for the first time. You'll have to have patience and dedication because the frustration is real.

Highly highly recommended.","This is an okay-ish game. Please understand that this is a puzzle, not a means to learn programming. Personally i am not a puzzle guy, but the game is quite hard, so i guess it is a good puzzler.Instead, this review will focus on analyzing the programming part of the game.You have all this box setup of 3x4. The amount of boxes available to you depends on the puzzle. Each box allows for 12 line of code. Each box has arrows from it to the adjacent boxes. That's for controlling I\/O. You get the MOV command to control I\/O. Down are the 4 cases on how you can use this command.MOV 10 UP - for example moves value 10 to the box above the current one.MOV UP DOWN - takes input from the box above, and sends it to the box below itself.MOV UP ACC - takes input from the upper box, and puts it into a variable called ACC.MOV UP NIL - takes the input, and discards it.Also, the MOV command logic requires the upper box to be free when doing MOV 10 UP for example. Same for the MOV UP DOWN, which requires the upper box to have some input waiting in there. If the necessary direction is not free, or the input is not there, the code in that box halts on that line.Each box has 2 variables called ACC and BAK, and a command to switch the values. ACC is interactable, and BAK is not. The only way to interact with BAK is to switch it.The ALU in this language is a mess.You have ADD and SUB.ADD VALUEValue gets added to the ACC.There is no multiplication. The closest thing you get is multiplication by 2 - ADD ACC.This is an assembly language, so there are labels, and branch commands. The comparison operators are however a piece of work.You get ACC == 0, ACC != 0, ACC > 0, ACC < 0.The code is run line by line, 1 line at a time. When the box reaches the last line, it starts over. Each box has to communicate in synchrony, and that's where halting with MOV comes in for example.There is also a branch for jumping lines, called JRO VALUE. JRO 1 will go to the next line. JRO -1 to the previous line. JRO 0 will stay on the same line, which makes it run indefinately and thus stops the execution in that box.There is also NOP, which is a dummy command. Since the game runs code 1 line at a time, NOP is another command to synchronize the boxes.If you wanna know more, there is a manual on this game. Just search for it on net.Personally, i find this to be a very frustrating and limiting langauge. If this was the way programs were wrote, i wouldn't be a programmer.","Great puzzle game with simple rules that still offers a bit of challenge.The game uses a fictional assmebly based language but don't be put off if you don't know what that isbecause you don't need to be a computer programmer to understand or play this game.There are only a small handfull of commands that you need to understand which you will pick up quick and the firstfew problems ease you in to it.If you like puzzle games but you're looking for something a little different, give this a go."],["A really amazing game.

Really? Huh, ok. Then I guess TIS-100 is made for you. I wasnt ready, sorry, usually people prefer games with guns or cars, you know.Anyway, TIS-100 is an emulator for an imaginary machine, on which you code with a set of 13 simple instructions on up to 12 parallel nodes, each having a space for only 15 different instructions. Program space quickly becomes an issue and asks of you to be clever to make your program fit.Compared to classic assembly instruction sets like x86, TIS-100 is really simple, and does not offer much. You can move values, add and subtract, do conditional jumps, but not multiply, divide, do logical operations nor bits operation. And more importantly, each node has only access to two registers, but only one can be accessed directly, the other acting more like a distant memory. This makes the coding tedious at times, and forces you to think differently to create programs.And the later problems in the games ask you for example to determine the prime factors of a number up to 99, in ascending order (e.g. 86 would result in 2, 2, 3, 7). When finally, after hours of thinking and programming, your program finally goes through all the numbers successfully, a feeling of proudness arises.And if solving the problems is not enough for you, you can still try to optimize your programs so they execute faster, or take less space in number of nodes or instructions.

The skill being taught here could be seen as coding basics, or just really grinding out your logician capabilities, completing tasks with limited options on how to proceed. If you've into a game that will feel like a lesson, and kind of hurt your brain a little if you're not used to using those wires (which I certainly wasn't, despite being a lover of logic puzzles - this is a whole different beast), and an uphill struggle for what reward, I do not know, then this is actually a pretty good puzzle. If you're looking for a game, albeit a challenging one, or a puzzler, something to engage your synapsis - but a game nonetheless - then I don't honestly recommend this. It's a chore more than a game. A keeper, to put away for the day when you want to kill time and >aren't< burnt out and just looking for entertainment.In short - if you want to learn a skill presented in the form of a game, where essentially a single 'puzzle' is presented and gets harder as you progress, in order to better familiarise you with this skill, then TIS will scratch your itch. Otherwise, I can't suggest this to anyone who's looking to game for the traditional purpose of gaming - to unwind or have fun.","make me headachereally challenging game"],["I'm only recommending this if you're into programming and are willing to do some extra reading related to actual computer science just to understand just what some of the more vague puzzles require from you.

First it's super-simplified, and second you don't really have any RAM. You only have like two registers per processing node and the input-output registers of adjacent blocks. This may simplify things a bit but it also means you can't do things the way you would with real computers.The main problem with it is, if you don't finish it and then stop playing it for a few months then you'll forget things and it will be a pain to get back to it and remember what you were doing.

I have what i would consider to be nothing more than a hobbiest interest in programming, although I do work with SQL pretty regularly, and I would argue, none of my experience was needed to play this game.At it's core, it's a very simple programming game, with a set of very restrictive rules, that once you get the hang of, becomes insanely rewarding once you realize what you're doing. This is the type of game that gets people hooked on programming by focusing on what makes it such a beautiful process.Most of these puzzles can be figured out on pen and paper, but it's a lot of fun to experiment with your code and see if you were right in the clever way you decided to tackle it.Don't get bogged down in the technical manual that comes with it. Read the commands, try to understand what the sample programs are trying to teach you, and then just experiment until something clicks. It took me awhile just to understand exactly what I was even supposed to do, and now I'm starting to make my way through the challenges a lot faster than when I started. Now when I read the manual, I have a much better understanding of what the techincal jargon means just because I have the context from the code I wrote.I would argue the first puzzle is easily the most important. 1. it teaches you how the system works, when it is working. And 2, it will give you an immediate confidence boost when you get it do the very simple request it asks of you. You can ride that confidence into the future puzzles. When your code works, it's an amazing feeling. I'm hoping when I finish it, I'll go back and find ways to optimize my code. It feels like I won't be done with this for a very long time.Don't give up! There's a reason this game is so well reviewed. It's a lot of fun, and the execution of it is so damn clever. I'm very happy I got it.

You can return to old puzzles, trying to solve them in a faster or more efficient or compact manner. What makes this game special to me, even above other zachtronics games, is:The presentation of TIS-100 is entirely diegetic; when you start the game up, you see an old computer boot up. Your only tutorials are the learning curve of the early puzzles and a VERY short reference manual with some examples that can be physically printed for extra immersion. Its very monolithic and attention-grabbing, which does wonders for your focus and concentration (spacechem often distracted me with unnecessary plot fluff and music, so this is a huge plus for me).In terms of puzzle design and progression, the coolest part of TIS-100 is the availability of ALL programming commands from the very beginning. On the second puzzle, you probably wont have any clue what \"JEZ LOOP\" means or what the \"JRO\" command actually does, but both are there from the start and the only thing keeping you from using them is learning how they work. It feels so empowering to \"unlock\" a new power by simply learning how to use it, rather than a button on a quick menu being automatically made available to you (as in most games).This is an extremely satisfying and empowering puzzle game for anyone, with a TINY cost of entry (i think i paid 2 dollars on sale for it) and NO PRIOR PROGRAMMING EXPERIENCE IS REQUIRED. i had absolutely minimal experience with just visual basic before playing this, and STILL managed to solve a few puzzles with record high scores.

It is not easy. It is not really a game.With that said, this is a really clever title. The premise is that you have inherited an old computer and you solve a series of puzzles to figure it out and uncover some interesting facts. These puzzles are actually programming exercises. The code you are writing is a type of low-level assembler, with a limited instruction set and a quirky, yet clever \"tesselated\" architecture.

The sound effects are also simple, but effective.There is a sandbox mode, to let you experiment, and a manual which has been nicely done, with period fonts and that old photocopied-manual look. What is also neat is that your programmes are rated against everyone else, in terms of speed, cycles, and nodes used, so you can get an idea as to if your solution was efficient or not.Just be aware that this is about programming. I don't really want to call it a game, as there is no \"gameplay\" as such.

I was working on a solution today, nothing special, nothing clever.  As I'm working through the different outcomes I notice that on one output there was a requirement that unraveled my plan.

You're not getting away that easy.\"  I had to sit down and write a review for someone on the fence and looking for that last review that convenes them to give this game their time."],["TL;DR: this game really makes you think and can teach you some important algorithmic ideas. It will be interesting if you have some interest in programming, doesn't require special skills other than thinking and will be challenging even for those who have experience in high-level programming languages.Longer:Well, first of all, although it's called a \"programming game\", it doesn't require any special skills or knowledge to play it. The in-game \"manual\" is only 14 pages long, and it's enough to describe everithing you need to know. The game uses an overly simplified version of assembler (no need to know what that is) with only a dozen of instructions. If you can understand what phrases like \"moving a number from one place to another\" and \"jump to another place under a certain condition\" mean - you can play it.Surely this game will be boring if you have never had any interest in such areas. Otherwise it will not only be an interesting challenge, but also will teach you some quite important ideas about algorighms. Not just \"teach\" you by showing and explaining them, but by making you come to the realisation yourself, so that it will be in fact your own idea you came up with on your own. Solving every task means to realise some underlying idea. Like \"how do I multiply using only addition and limited memory?\", \"how do I compare numbers using only arithmetic and comparation with zero?\", etc. It's useful to know since it's close enough to how real computers do it (considering only the algorithmic part).But it can be said about almost every game of this kind. What is so special about it? I, judging by my limited experience, can say the following. After you understand how to solve the problem, you have actually completed a mere half of the level. Yes, you got the necessary idea and created a correct program. But this program is guaranteed to be \"inefficient\", that is, taking too long to finish (look at the histograms after finishing a level, showing \"global stats\"). There are some more subtle ideas to be discovered here, about how to make it more efficient, which are also important in real life (although not all of them are applicable there due to specific architecture of the TIS-machine, see below). They are harder to get but the feeling of superiurity, which you receive after achieving the best possible result, is even better than that after killing a boss in dark souls, since it's not your reflexes who have won, but your wits. Only after that you may say \"I have finished the task completely\", only thus you get from the game everything it can offer. But later in the game this part is much more of the \"game\" side rather than the \"schoolbook\" one, since it mostly deals with \"how to use the special architecture of TIS more efficient\" instead of \"how to make the algoright itself better\".Of course having some experience in general programming (if you have never dealt with assembler) may be helpful, but it won't let you solve every puzzle in an instant, since you still have to adapt what you know into the limits of the game, including the toy-version of assembler, the limit on the number of instruction per cell, etc. Also, it's not an ordinary \"toy computer\" which you can deal with in the most of the games. The main structural difference with the real CPUs is that here you have several \"processing units\" at once, each of them commicating with the adjacent ones by direct transferring of data and each having their own program inside. So it feels like managing several simple computers at once, which completely changes the situation. There is also no any kind of RAM (just a couple of \"stack memory\" nodes later in the game), as you might have guessed already. So it still will be interesting for you. Just don't forget that it's just a game, and not a simulator. Although in the later part the tasks become impossible to solve without spending some time with pen and paper, which makes it look more like your college homework, which is another one of downsides of this game. But if that is ok with you - no obstacles for you to enjoy the game."],["If you have an interest in working with simplified assembly instructions to complete puzzles, then this game is for you.And my god, is it fun.

This way even a seasoned assembly language programmer will be forced out of their comfort zone, as you have to adapt and tailor your solutions to the very specific aspects and limitations of the underlying architecture.As a side note I have read negative reviews criticizing this last point I made, however from my point of view this is exactly what makes this game so interesting (nonetheless I am aware that this game is not for everyone).Obviously this analogy is only partly applicable, but I think at least to some extent you could compare it to being tasked to land a helicopter, whose cyclic is partly broken, thus eliminating the obvious solution and forcing you to think creatively and really consider all your available options.","TLDR; if you can't spend the time to read this you probably won't like reading the manual.10\/10 wouldloop{01100011 01110101 01101101 }The first achievement is RTFM.

TIS-100 lacks a guided step by step tutorial instead opting to give the user a manual that details the commands of the pseudo programming language that the player uses to control the game. This allows great immersion and lets the player feel like a person working with the language and not someone playing the game. However it also leaves you feeling confused as your not given knowledge when you need it rather all at once and are left to figure out what commands are usual for your given situation.I struggled through the first level and subsequently had to rely on a walkthrough and explanation for the next 3. Using what i learned in those hand held 3 levels I was able to apply my knowledge to the 5th level and work it out without any assistance. This was extremely rewarding for me,  I truly felt like a programmer problem solving my way to a solution, manual in hand. For this reason i recommend TIS-100.(TLDR) In short, TIS-100 has the potential to be a rewarding pseudo programming puzzler to the player that is willing to seek out information for themselves rather than be provided it in the form of a tutorial. I hope my review was helpful :)","This game is incredible. I'm a software engineer who has worked primarily with implicit, object-oriented languages such as C#, in a time where restrictions on memory or space are not nearly the concern they used to be.

The system of this game has a great amount of freedom, there is the \"right way\" and there is the \"other right way\". There is no wrong way as long as the program works and that the program follows the instructions given to you. Since the instructions are vague and there is no tutorial, you are provided with a manual. The manual is pretty neat. By reading this manual you gain a deeper understanding of the game as well as an idea of what to do with the keywords, their functions and the possibilities they can offer.I highly recommend this game to any programming geek, an office worker, or even a casual gaming parent.(When TIS-100 goes on sale, it become pretty cheap.

So consider this an every-man perspective.This is a game that may seem extremely intimidating at first, nearly unapproachable, but with just a LITTLE bit of patience, you'll start to understand just what this game is. This game is built around the idea that you are working on an odd government prototype computer that your recently passed uncle discovered at a yard sale. You inherit it and need to figure out what the hell it is, what it does, how it works, and how to fix it. When you boot it up, the game prompts you with the recommendation that you should read or even print out the user manual to:A) Help teach yourself what you're doing B) Ultimately save yourself some time andC) Create even more of a sense of immersionIn that regard, you REALLY should print it out and read the manual, because oddly enough, reading the manual in real life and figuring out the main menu is actually a part of the game and your first REAL puzzle. Fourth wall breaking. The immersion of this game is surprisingly impressive, and the story (hidden in files as you uncorrupt the system, left over by your uncle) adds to all of that.So, how about the puzzles themselves? Well, think of it like you're using words (a verb and noun pair) to make lines of commands in geographically spaced out computing notes to write abstract equations to solve the puzzle each level, changing the set numeric inputs into the desired and expected outputs. In short, you are using a limited selection of recognized commands to write an equation, and do so in a limited space as efficiently as you can. Very different from anything I've ever played.This is not my comfort zone, but still refreshing. With patience, I've been able to solve the first 5 levels, but with the difficulty ramp up (which is pretty severe, to be honest) I'm not sure how much farther I can proceed, which is why I'm taking a hiatus from the game to write this review. I'll try again after I dabble in some of the creator's other works, which I'm looking forward to trying out. All in all, considering how cheap this game is on sale (around $1), and how unique it is, it's REALLY hard not to recommend it, just as a curiosity if nothing else.

This is one of those games where those 5 hours felt a lot longer than it should be. Almost like how work hours seem to last forever. I can only recommend this game to anyone who is highly interested in puzzles, or any programmer who wants to challenge themselves in their understanding of programming concepts. Unlike real life assembly language, the game creates some additional obstacles, which depending on your take, can go from unpleasant to being fascinating. For example the game has a fundamental challenge in which passing data between registers has a limited restriction based on where the register is located. Other obstacles included a limited count of max lines per \"module\" you can type in.As a programmer if you can appreciate the stripping of a programming system, where certain patterns are highlighted and encouraged over what one would probably be used to. You would probably appreciate the design of the game. Despite the game adding in restrictions (which is honestly part of the puzzle) there are still many familiar concepts that one would encounter in other to solve said puzzles. Obviously the basic if statements, jumps are there, but concepts such as jump tables, creating a stack with registers are still existing things one may find themselves using to solve the puzzles. (Especially if you're going for the achievements)That being said, the game does not seem to in any way teach any of said programming concepts. There is only a manual that provides the syntax, or more like the controls of the game. Unlike other puzzle games, there aren't really any tutorials. And the concepts one would use to solve them are quite logical and mathematical in nature, as opposed to a game like Portal 2, where the concepts are ones that most people would have a better intuition for. Which may make it a frustrating game for those who are not as well versed in the concepts used in the game, as it does no hand holding.I would consider the game to appeal to a rather limited audience, that being said. If you are part of that audience, what you could get from it, is a greater appreciation of the many systems and concepts that programming explores. Both from the lack of it in the game, because there certainly are many enhancing systems in the real world for us to solve complex problems, but also from the concepts the game chooses to explore, which are often used in the real world."],["It's a bit cryptic to start but this is a great puzzle game.

I've just completed this game with 100% achievements and I've spent more hours on this game than obtaining 100% achievements for Dark Souls 1 & 2, but quite a number of it was probably spent falling asleep. The only thing these games have in common is that you'd be on the verge of giving up but you know they are solvable problems because many before you have done so. I studied electrical engineering and I do a fair bit of coding in my work so the workings of assembly wasn't entirely foreign to me, and I knew the basics of debugging and using pseudo-code to formulate solutions. I've a few tips below:1) Always begin by using pen and paper to prepare the logic behind your solution. This can be in the form of pseudo-code in whichever programming language you're familiar with.2) Assign each variable to an individual shift register, and figure out which nodes will require direct communication to perform conditional checks.3) You can minimize conditional checking by observing the inputs for the puzzle. Sometimes they fall within a certain range of values or the sequence length is limited.4) Read the manual thoroughly and know what JEZ JGZ JLZ JRO do because they are your best friends. 5) When writing a sequence to a stack memory node, always consider executing the entire sequence before retrieving new values. This can be achieved by ensuring that the first node obtains a response from the rest of the program before going back to the start .6) All ACC and BAK values are automatically flushed and the registers reset to the initial state once a test is finished. You need not worry about being prepared for the subsequent two tests and the random tests.7) For image puzzles, you can write x and y coordinates which are out of bounds with no consequence.8) Use \"!\" to place breakpoints in order to debug your code.9) If you're stuck on a puzzle for too long, consider attempting the rest in order to unlock more puzzles. Sometimes you get inspirations from solving a later puzzle which can be used to solve an earlier puzzle. Happy coding and try your best to avoid getting specific puzzle hints! Most of the joy from this game comes from having a sense of individual accomplishment much like Dark Souls","Fun, no-nonsense programming puzzle game. You are tasked with fixing a corrupted computer system, consisting of a bunch of simple processors that can only communicate with adjacent processors and adjacent peripherals such as graphics displays or stack memory, by implemented programs that satisfy tests. Once you pass a test, the puzzle is completed and you get to see your ranking compared to other players in terms of number of instructions used, number of processors used and time used. Sometimes you'll work on a solution only to learn that others have completed it using slightly less resources. This encourages looking at the problem again to optimize your own solution.The programming language used resembles a simple machine code assembler syntax. Each processor has an accumulator that can be used for simple arithmetic (add and subtract). This can be swapped with a backup register, but you can not perform arithmetic on both registers at once. In that sense, each processor has very little working memory and has to cooperate with other processors to solve some of the problems. This is done using four registers that refer to the adjacent processors, which are used to send (when written) and receive data (when read). There are only a handful of instructions altogether, which makes it easy to learn and focus on the tasks, but hard to implement complex algorithms, which is what the puzzle aspect stems from.The game comes with an \"in-character\" manual for the TIS-100 computer which contains notes, tips and a programmer's reference. There is a story to the game that I won't say too much about, but as you progress you get bits of information that you can piece together to learn what happened to the TIS-100 before you got to it. If you think you'd be into a programming game with a more involved story, I recommend Exapunks and Shenzhen I\/O, but I personally like TIS-100 more because its simple rules and subtle story make it easier to get back into after a long break."],["Great fun, with a lot to nerd-out about.","Do you want your head to explode?Do you want to spend time, which could be used instead for better things like studying for university, to solve this?Do you want to come back to this game, even though you said \"I'm done with this?\"?Well, my friend, this is the game for you if you love to waste hours away solving puzzles and get a sense of victory out of it.

Probably more than once.If that didn't put you off, it's actually pretty cool. This is 80's-style embedded coding -- the game is built of a grid of interconnected CPUs that are barely powerful enough to do anything at all, forcing you to build programs that span a network of 5-6 nodes to do the simplest things. Those limitations force creativity and the sort of clever coding that would be unacceptable at your day job. For example:LOOP:\n  SUB 1\n  MOV ACC DOWN\n  JGZ LOOPis surprisingly inefficient, because that label is on a line all by itself, wasting one of your precious lines! But your line lengths are extremely limited, so to put it on a line with other code, you'll often use extremely abbreviated labels:L: SUB 1\nMOV ACC DOWN\nJGZ LThis is why I say you'll want to read the manual several times: There are opcodes and tricks that you might forget about until there's a puzzle hard enough to require them.

So you'll end up having to think outside the box a lot, figuring out alternative ways towards the small bits and pieces you need in order to complete the overarching task. It's a lot of \"optimizing\" your own way of thinking in a sense.And if you let it, this stuff can *really* get into your head.That being said though, this stuff gets complicated fast.The game does a pretty good job at easing you into the more difficult things by giving you more straightforward tasks at first. Frequently enough, later tasks will build up on top of the solutions you come up with for earlier tasks. So while the tools you have available don't ever change much, what *does* change is the toolset that is your experience with the system.Essentially, the ideas you use to solve early puzzles will become tools for later puzzles.Those later puzzles however can get *really* tight on your operation counts. And if you don't think hard about micro-optimizations every now and then, some of those may be nearly impossible to beat.Also, don't expect your tasks to be all that glorious.You develop a division algorithm. Or you draw simple pictures on the screen. Or maybe you develop a sorting algorithm. If you have dealt with high-level programming languages before, it's basically all about implementing their kinds of features, but without actually *using* any of their kinds of features.The part that's fun about that though is when you go into it thinking that it should very much not be possible, given the very limited toolset that you have available, but then later notice that you just managed to pull it off anyway. \"Performing a division using only addition and subtraction operations? How is that supposed to work?\"This is a really good brainteaser game. And if you can get past the first hurdles of reading a boring programming manual, and there being absolutely nothing visually appealing besides some white code blocks on a black background, and there being *literally nothing* besides the puzzle presented to you, then you're in for something that can keep you busy for quite a few hours.(Or, if you get too into it, one or the other sleepless night.)"],["If I ever beat this game Im going to put it on my resume.","Reminds me of my Intro to Programming classes in college!

I'm no stranger to assembly language, but after coming home from a long day I'd rather do something a little less taxing on the mind, like crying or heavy drinking. So it sorta got lost in the bottomless pit of my library. However, coronavirus recent events have put me in a position where I'm stuck at home without much to do. So I finally decided to suit up and take on the Tessellated Intelligence System. And after coming out the other end, I can confidently say that this game is basically my college-level systems class, but without the Adderall and the crippling student debt.To be honest, I don't think you really need me to recommend TIS-100 to you. After reading the description, you probably already know if this is of interest to you. The fact that you're even down here reading my poorly-worded rant makes me assume that you're at least slightly interested in low-level programming. If this is the case you'll be happy to know that there really aren't any surprises here; what you see is what you get. You boot up the titular TIS-100 and solve little programming puzzles modeled after a rudimentary assembly language. I hope you like MOVs and JMPs! The puzzles start off easy enough, but quickly become very challenging, with many of them requiring a lot of forethought. Prudent players will start each segment by carefully sketching out inputs and modeling the data flow through their system. Or you can play like me, and haphazardly vomit code into each of the nodes until it works. Regardless of your coding style, it's very satisfying when everything comes together to do what you want.TIS-100 is very good at ramping up the difficulty and making you feel smart. When I was first thumbing through the manual, I kept thinking that there's no way this limited toolset can achieve anything worthwhile. However, as I gained more experience and learned a couple of neat tricks I slowly found myself thinking that less and less. The obvious difficulty with most of the problems is simply how you're going to store information. You only get two registers per node, and you cant directly read or write to one of them. This means you'll spend a lot of time thinking about how the nodes in the grid communicate. Oftentimes, the solutions to earlier problems can be modified to handle later ones. This helps to generate a nice sense of progression, as you slowly build up a library of useful patterns to handle any task thrown at you. I really don't have any major complaints with TIS-100, but I'll note some mild annoyances here. It'd be nice if the game gave more info on problem constraints. I found myself frequently asking questions like, \"Does the input include negative numbers?\" or \"Is there a max\/min value?\". It's important to know this stuff because it helps when optimizing solutions. Thankfully, the answer to these questions is pretty obvious by looking at the input stream, but it would have been nice to get it in writing. The sound effects can also be kind of annoying. The way they bleep at you with every wrong output, it's worse ASMR than my  alarm clock. That's all I really have to nag about; this is a very tightly designed time-killer with virtually no fluff. It's literally just programming puzzles. You get a lot of bang for your buck with this game, mostly because the first half is really just a tutorial for the second. I'll probably be hacking away at the second suite of problems for quite some time. Even if you do manage to solve all of the puzzles, you can spend hours optimizing your previous solutions and toying around in the sandbox. If you enjoy working with an outdated and esoteric computer system, I can't think of a game that's more down your street than TIS-100. And even if you don't consider yourself a programmer, I still think that TIS-100 is a fun tool for getting your feet wet in assembly. It doesn't really assume any prior knowledge, and the manual is well written with many examples that'll get you programming in no time. Here are a few tips to help any brave newbies out: '!' is your best friend. Instead of tackling the entire problem all at once, break it down into smaller and more manageable sub-problems.  It's called the Tessellated Intelligence System for a reason: modularity is key! If possible, each node should handle one specific task. You can let nodes multitask when you reach later problems or when you want to optimize a solution.  If you get truly stuck on a problem just walk away for a bit. Often when you return, you'll have much more clarity than when you left. Good luck and remember that it's okay if your program doesn't work right, because if it did you'd be out of a job, or in this case a really damn good game.","Definetly recommended!!","I would Recommend this puzzle game, it is a tough challenge and I am yet to finish the last few puzzels myself still.","Good assembler demo"],["if you have a bent toward programming, this is an interesting build. if you are not familiar with low level programming (assembly) you might find it more stressful, as your programming will be somewhat less familiar than you might be accustomed to, but this can be a place to start understanding low(er) level systems.","This game probably isn't for every, BUT, if you think it might be for you, then it definitely is.Rather than \"puzzle solving\", playing TIS-100 is more like \"problem solving\". Just solving the levels at all would be interesting enough, but optimizing those solutions is where the game really shines. Any given level can be approached with a number of different strategies, each of which may be better or worse along each of the three metrics the game encourages you to optimize for. Rather than global leaderboards, the game presents global histograms, to give you a general idea of where a good solution lands in each metric, and local leaderboards pulled from your steam friends list, so you can compete against people you actually know, instead of the usual leaderboard experience of seeing yourself at #52199 or wherever and just feeling discouraged.There were a few things I thought would be annoying at first, but quickly learned to love. The lack of registers leads to you find creative ways of minimizing how much state you use, storing state in communication queues, and otherwise trying to avoid clobbering ACC. The small instruction windows naturally lead you into figuring out how to pipeline and parallelize your programs, which turn out to be critically important optimization techniques later on. The scant instruction set leads you to find creative workarounds using other properties of the system or just other instructions - particularly JRO, which is my favorite instruction and, in my opinion, the biggest hidden gem of this game.Of all the Zachtronics titles, it's probably the most balanced and most tightly designed one. It's also, in my opinion, the hardest one. There are a LOT of puzzles, every one is a unique challenge, and there's no feature of the instruction set that you won't find yourself using regularly. It's minimal, but that's just a byproduct of having no gimmicks.My only complaints are ergonomic ones: no volume controls, only 3 saves slots per level, and the text areas aren't as fully featured as I'd like.","I started playing this game after finishing Human Resource Machine. I was looking for another game that would provide me with a similar challenge and I have to say, this game got my juices running. It hits all the buttons that Human Resource Machine did. I like how the game looks and how it steadily gets harder.  It required a little initial effort for me to start playing it though, as right out of the box the game looks pretty daunting. Once I spent 5 minutes with the manual, I got right into it.Really enjoy the game.If you like computer science or programming, you're gonna like this.","Nice and tricky. Makes you think about efficiency.","big brain ouchy","Fun game. Takes a lot of problem solving. Have to use the manual. Worth it.","This game is not for the faint of heart -- it is a serious programming game modeled on early computing schemas, the kind they preach against in schools, exempli gratia the use of goto label statements instead of the more modern control structures such as if..then..else, do..while, foreach, et cetera.  The second easiest achievement in the game, find the hidden \"opcode\" or instruction is presently only accomplished by less than 10% of players.It is my opinion that Zachtronics has completely outdone themselves in creating this game: they not only created an RISC assembly language and an environment to run it, they created the feel of 70's computing by forcing the player to use their real computer to access the machine's manual, located in steam's app data, and allowing them to access and alter saves outside the game in the form of text files that any developer who has enhanced their skills by working outside an IDE would recognize.I do find myself frequently frustrated by the design of the TIS-100, specifically it's limited number of instructions and registers: all code must fit in a 18 x 15 block, there are two registers not including the four synchronized communication ports but only one of them is interactable, operations are limited to moving data between registers and ports, adding and subtracting, comparing the interactive register with zero, and jumping to labels.  And operations become very complicated such as performing general imaging tasks and sorting sequences of information, standard implementations of bubble-sort being unavailable due to system limitations.If I was not hopelessly addicted to programming and it's problems, if type-3 language was not more natural to me then type-1 language (a.k.a. natural language), I would have dropped this game like many others seem to have.  This is the hardest programming game I have yet to encounter, and so although I do recommend this game, most people, even most professional developers, may find they have bitten off more then they can chew.","10\/10","Fun, challenging puzzles that force you to be efficient and creative with your code."],["Clever puzzle game.

This is the kind of computer you'd expect to see in a movie like War Games.  If you've ever programmed a computer or calculator from the 1970s, this is a must-try.   You're going to learn some fundamentals of assembly language, but with a smattering of parallel processing.  The machine's advanced layout is balanced by its limited command set.  You're going to have to think to solve these programming problems.  The game introduces new concepts gradually, and leaves a few hints on how you might go about some of the problems, but this old beast of a machine demands an offering of gray matter.The reward of success is often followed by the open jaws when you see that some people had a solution that was faster, smaller, or more efficient than yours, so if you're a competitive type, prepare to work on some of these levels racking your brain to figure out how they did it.

Even as a trained EE it still offers a lot of challenge because it presents common\/simple problem setups in a very novel way.  There are only 13 commands to learn, and a few special operands for parallel processing (ANY, LAST).From an EE and ASM background, the two weirdest things about the TIS for me are:1.) Everything being in decimal rather than binary\/hex.  As a result there are no bitwise logical operations, which usually make up a decent chunk of an instruction set.2.) Lack of RAM and limited addressing.  You can address 1 register, the 4 directional ports, Nil (dev\/null), labels you create, and one jump relative command.The challenge comes from the game forcing you to rely on the parallelism of the TIS-100 to create small co-routines instead of using memory.  Having TA'd for a microcontroller class in college, I know how much of a struggle ASM can be when you're first learning it.  It's a very different way of thinking than higher level languages, and TIS in many ways is even more complicated.  I don't know that I'd recommend this game to those without at least a little prior exposure.One thing I find incredibly frustrating at times is the limit of 15 lines per node.  There are comments, but you don't always have the luxury of space for them.  I often find myself deleting comments, and shortening\/combining labels with op-codes into a single line to try to squeeze 1 or 2 more lines into a node.  In general, this is incredibly bad practice, because it's always better to use a few more lines and make the code clearer than it is to do it in fewer lines and have it be ugly and difficult to read (and when real ASM is run through an assembler, comments and label placement in the source don't affect the size of the generated binary).

The TIS-100 architecture, and I say this with affection, is so deadass stupid that everything you know from bitbanging on assembly registers just ain't gonna cut it anymore. You don't really have registers, just one accumulator, and computations must be spread out carefully over multiple blocks (or \"nodes\" as the manual calls them), which incentivizes finding ways to solve problems using parallelism - you literally must delegate your work across multiple nodes anyway, so it's a natural hop from that to learning to think through parallelism in the various puzzles.I find these puzzles really delightful :)","Makes all other problems in my life seem easy by comparison.","Don't be fooled by the plain looks of this game.

It's unclear what the TIS-100 is, but you get hints to it being some sort of classified or perhaps military-use computer used for signal processing.The game presents you with a selection of puzzles that you must solve with a basic assembly programming language and very limited resources. You must learn how to work with registers, creating loops, comparing values with nothing like a simple \"comparison\" operand, and so-forth. While it sounds difficult and it is, I think someone who has no programming experience can enjoy the game if they have the manual open.

The puzzles are essentially little assembly programming tasks and it can be enjoyable to see how complicated behaviour can be produced from very simple building blocks.The main issue I had with the programming segments is that the type of input you'll receive is often not well defined.For example you are asked to perform some operation on sequences of numbers but may not know:- Will there be negative numbers?- Will there be numbers greater than 10? greater than 100?- Will there be 0-length sequences?The answers to these questions can drastically change which solutions are viable, but you just have to look at the first set of test data and try to guess. It's annoying.The worst offender for this was a later puzzle where you need to find a pattern in a sequence. The problem is presented as if the pattern sequence can be any length, but (spoilers) it's always exactly 4 units long and I think the mission is almost impossible to solve without making that assumption.It also has a story which is... ehhhhPersonally I haven't been blown away with any Zachtronic story so far and this is no exception.It's roughly structured as a mystery as you learn about the device your using, and while some of the reveals are quite cool and intriguing the later parts just fell kinda flat for me. I can't go into detail about this without spoiling major plot points though, so I won't.Overall if you've played most of Zachtronics other games, you might enjoy this one as well, but it's not their best work.If you haven't played it, I'd recommend Exapunks instead.
